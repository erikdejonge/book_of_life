				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a section of The Book of Life that gathers together our canon: our selection of the greatest thinkers from the fields of philosophy, political theory, sociology, art, architecture and literature whom we believe have the most to offer to us today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of assembling a ‘canon’ can feel a bit awkward &#8211; maybe even oppressive. It can feel unfair to leave out so many people. And anyway, who decides? Surely the people making the canon are bringing some bias to their task?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We happily admit to bias. We’re sometimes taught to think ill of bias, as if the only good kind of information was that which carried absolutely no intention or design, and left everything up to the audience instead. This emphasis on neutrality is understandable; there has historically &#8211; especially in the 20th century &#8211; been a lot of bad bias around. But we ultimately believe that the goal isn’t to have no bias at all but to put forward ‘good’ bias; by which we mean, bias in favour of a selection of thinkers who point us to valuable and important ideas. At The School of Life, we are heavily biased towards emotional intelligence and the use of culture as a tool for consolation and enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8074294232_a6d8999596_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8693" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8074294232_a6d8999596_z.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="8074294232_a6d8999596_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have some quite specific views about what makes a thinker ‘great’. Typically, great thinkers are included in encyclopedic works on the basis of reputation: a list is drawn up asking what names have been most influential, and what ideas have most memorably shaped the intellectual world. However, we’ve got our sights on a different aim: we want to work out what ideas offer help with some of the leading problems of our own times. For us, a ‘great’ thinker is someone whose ideas stand the very highest chance of being helpful in our lives now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because a canon is necessarily so selective, it is always vulnerable to attack. We have a sanguine view of selection; selection is simply an inescapable feature of living in an information-rich world. The ideal isn’t to avoid being selective, the challenge is to try to select as well as possible. In our eyes, this means picking out thinkers who can unpick some of the greatest difficulties in our political, professional and personal lives. We aren’t historians recovering ideas for their own sakes; we are applied philosophers seeking intellectual concepts that can be put to work in the here and now.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5258089883_5b98ce066c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8698" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5258089883_5b98ce066c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C346" alt="5258089883_5b98ce066c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve worked hard to make the thinkers in The Book of Life sound simple, easy and (hopefully) quite charming. In the past, many of these thinkers have been caught in a fiendish trap. What they have had to say has been hugely relevant and important. But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> they have said it has guaranteed that they went unheard: because their books were a little too dense, some of their ideas sounded odd and many of their most crucial concepts were prone to get lost amidst a welter of subsidiary information. We’ve recovered what we see as the important ideas in our chosen thinkers by following a number of principles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few things that any mind, however great, has ever said are likely to be of central lasting importance.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">These key points are detachable from the full body of a thinker’s work. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are forgetful, time-pressured creatures. We are liable to forget every intricacy of a complex sustained argument. So we need central messages spelt out memorably and simply. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever academic culture tells us, context is not decisive. Important truths get lodged in odd places and can be extricated from them; they may lie in 3rd century China, in an aristocratic salon in 18th century Paris or in a small house in an alpine village in the 19th century. Yet what always matters in the end is what they can do for us now.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a tragic paradox that there are ways of showing reverence for the great thinkers that ends up preventing them having an impact in the world &#8211; the opposite result which reverence initially hoped for. Being a little casual with a great thinker is the biggest homage one could pay to him or her.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guiding concern is that great ideas should be widely known and that they should be active in our lives. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>That said, we recognise that there are proper worries around ‘simplification’. There is a concern &#8211; fed by the academic world &#8211; that if you simplify, you inevitably betray: you omit the stuff that really matters. We understand the anxiety, but don’t want to let it triumph, for we are equally aware of the dangers of listening to it too closely: needless complexity can lead to good ideas being ignored altogether. We think that the important truths about how we might live are capable of popular formulation. We’re against the tragic view that what is important is condemned always to be unpopular or incomprehensible to most citizens.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5271593920_32ec1daa9d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8696" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5271593920_32ec1daa9d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5271593920_32ec1daa9d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popularising is, from our perspective, a great and noble task, especially in a democratic consumer-led world where elite culture has (more or less) lost its sway. It’s what makes ideas real in the life of a society. In any case, our lives are never entirely bookish or intellectual. We’re always driven by, and to an extent reliant on straightforward thoughts that guide our conduct. Those ideas are the ones that matter to the day to day flourishing of a community. Preciousness can be the downfall of the best concepts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern world has to date left the study and transmission of cultural ideas largely to university departments in the humanities. Their main focus has been on trying to understand what great thinkers were about in and of themselves. Here, somewhat heretically, we’re doing something very different: we want to know what they can do for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve mined history to bring you the ideas we believe to be of the greatest relevance to our own times. We will have succeeded if, in the days and years ahead, you find yourself turning to them to illuminate the multiple dilemmas and griefs of daily life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Athens, 2400 years ago. It’s a compact place: around 250,000 people live here. There are fine baths, theatres, temples, shopping arcades and gymnasiums. Art is flourishing, and science too. You can pick up excellent fish down at the harbour in Piraeus. It’s warm for more than half the year.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1024px-Akropolis_by_Leo_von_Klenze1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4896" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1024px-Akropolis_by_Leo_von_Klenze1.jpg?resize=635%2C371" alt="1024px-Akropolis_by_Leo_von_Klenze1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="color: #252525;">Leo von Klenze, The Acropolis, </span><span style="color: #252525;">1846 </span></h5>
<p class="p1">This is also home to the world’s first true – and probably greatest – philosopher: Plato.</p>
<p class="p2">Born into a prominent and wealthy family in the city, Plato devoted his life to one goal: helping people to reach a state of what he termed:</p>
<p class="p2">εὐδαιμονία</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eudaimonia: this peculiar but fascinating Greek word is a little hard to translate: it almost means ‘happiness’ but is really closer to ‘fulfilment’, because ‘happiness’ suggests continuous chirpiness – whereas ‘fulfilment’ is more compatible with periods of great pain and suffering – which seem to be an unavoidable part even of a good life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How did Plato propose to make people more fulfilled? Four central ideas stand out in his work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Think harder</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato proposed that our lives go wrong in large part because we almost never give ourselves time to think carefully and logically enough about our plans. And so we end up with the wrong values, careers and relationships. Plato wanted to bring order and clarity to our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He observed how many of our ideas are derived from what the crowd thinks, from what the Greeks called ‘doxa’, and we’d call ‘common-sense’. And yet repeatedly, across the 36 books he wrote, Plato showed this common-sense to be riddled with errors, prejudice and superstition. Popular ideas about love, fame, money or goodness simply don’t stand up to reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato also noticed how proud people were about being led by their instincts or passions (jumping into decisions on the basis of nothing more than ‘how they felt’), and he compared this to being dragged dangerously along by a group of blindfolded wild horses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Freud was happy to acknowledge, Plato was the inventor of therapy, insisting that we learn to submit all our thoughts and feelings to reason. As Plato repeatedly wrote, the essence of philosophy came down to the command to:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">γνῶθι σεαυτόν</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Know yourself.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Love More Wisely</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato is one of the great theorists of relationships. His book, <em>The Symposium</em>, is an attempt to explain what love really is. It tells the story of a dinner party given by Agathon, a handsome poet, who invites a group of his friends around to eat, drink and talk about love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1298" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/symposium.jpg" alt="symposium" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 id="firstHeading" class="firstHeading" lang="en" style="color: black;"><span dir="auto">Anselm Feuerbach, The Symposium, 1874</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The guests all have different views about what love is. Plato gives his old friend Socrates – one of the main characters in this and all his books – the most useful and interesting theory. It goes like this: when you fall in love, what’s really going on is that you have seen in another person some good quality which you haven’t got. Perhaps they are calm, when you get agitated; or they are self-disciplined, while you’re all over the place; or they are eloquent when you are tongue-tied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The underlying fantasy of love is that by getting close to this person, you can become a little like they are. They can help you to grow to your full potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Plato’s eyes, love is in essence a kind of education: you couldn’t really love someone if you didn’t want to be improved by them. Love should be two people trying to grow together – and helping each other to do so. Which means you need to get together with the person who contains a key missing bit of your evolution: the virtues you don’t have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sounds entirely odd nowadays when we tend to interpret love as finding someone perfect just as they are. In the heat of arguments, lovers sometimes say to one another: ‘If you loved me, you wouldn’t try to change me.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato thinks the diametric opposite. He wants us to enter relationships in a far less combative and proud way. We should accept that we are not complete and allow our lovers to teach us things. A good relationship has to mean we won’t love the other person exactly as they are. It means committing to helping them become a better version of themselves – and to endure the stormy passages this inevitably involves – while also not resisting their attempts to improve us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. The Importance of beauty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone – pretty much – likes beautiful things. But we tend to think of them as a bit mysterious in their power over us and, in the greater scheme, not terribly important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Plato proposed that it really matters what sorts of houses or temples, pots or sculptures you have around you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beauty.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4897" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/beauty.jpg?resize=635%2C435" alt="beauty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Portrait of Sappho</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one before Plato had asked the key question: why do we like beautiful things? He found a fascinating reason: we recognise in them a part of ‘the good’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are lots of good things we aspire to be: kind, gentle, harmonious, balanced, peaceful, strong, dignified. These are qualities in people. But they are also qualities in objects. We get moved and excited when we find in objects the qualities we need but are missing in our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Beautiful objects therefore have a really important function. They invite us to evolve in their direction, to become as they are. Beauty can educate our souls.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It follows that ugliness is a serious matter too, for it parades dangerous and damaged characteristics in front of us. It encourages us to be like it: harsh, chaotic, brash. It makes it that much harder to be wise, kind and calm.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato sees art as therapeutic: it is the duty of poets and painters (and nowadays, novelists, television producers and designers) to help us live good lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato believed in the censorship of the arts. It’s not the paradox it seems. If artists can help us live well, they can, unfortunately, equally give prestige and glamour to unhelpful attitudes and ideas. Just being an artist doesn’t guarantee the power of art will be wisely used.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why Plato believed that artists should work under the command of philosophers, who would give them the right ideas and ask them to make these convincing and popular. Art was to be a sort of propaganda – or advertising – for the good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Changing society</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato spent a lot of time thinking how the government and society should ideally be. He was the world’s first utopian thinker.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1305" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Young_Spartans_National_Gallery_NG3860.jpg" alt="640px-Young_Spartans_National_Gallery_NG3860" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Edgar Degas, Young Spartans Exercising, 1860</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this, he was inspired by Athens’s great rival: Sparta. This was a city-sized machine for turning out great soldiers. Everything the Spartans did – how they raised their children, how their economy was organised, whom they admired, how they had sex, what they ate – was tailored to that one goal. And Sparta was hugely successful, from a military point of view.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that wasn’t Plato’s concern. He wanted to know: how could a society get better at producing not military power but eudaimonia? How could it reliably help people towards fulfilment?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his book, <em>The Republic</em>, Plato identifies a number of changes that should be made:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">a) We need new heroes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Athenian society was very focused on the rich, like the louche aristocrat Alcibiades, and sports celebrities, like the boxer Milo of Croton. Plato wasn’t impressed: it really matters who we admire, for celebrities influence our outlook, ideas and conduct. And bad heroes give glamour to flaws of character.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato therefore wanted to give Athens new celebrities, replacing the current crop with ideally wise and good people he called Guardians: models for everyone’s good development. These people would be distinguished by their record of public service, their modesty and simple habits, their dislike of the limelight and their wide and deep experience. They would be the most honoured and admired people in society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">b) We need censorship</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today censorship makes us anxious. But Plato was worried about the wrong sort of freedom: Athens was a free-for-all for the worst opinion-sellers. Crazy religious notions and sweet sounding, but dangerous, ideas sucked up mass enthusiasm and lead Athens to disastrous governments and misguided wars (like a fateful attack on Sparta).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Discurso_funebre_pericles.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4899" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Discurso_funebre_pericles.png?resize=635%2C429" alt="Discurso_funebre_pericles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="color: #252525;">Pericles&#8217; Funeral Oration</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Continuous exposure to a storm of confused voices was – Plato thought – seriously bad for us, so he wanted to limit the activities of public orators and dangerous preachers. He would – nowadays – have been very sceptical about the power of mass media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">c) Better Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato believed passionately in education, but wanted to refocus the curriculum. The primary thing we need to learn is not just maths or spelling, but how to be good: we need to learn about courage, self-control, reasonableness, independence and calm.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1670705291.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4903" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1670705291.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="167070529" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Plato&#8217;s Academy</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To put this into practice, Plato founded a school called The Academy in Athens, which flourished for over 400 years. You went there to learn nothing less than how to live and die well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s fascinating and not a little sad how modern academic institutions have outlawed this ambition. If a student showed up at Oxford or Harvard universities today seeking to be taught how to live, the professors would call the police – or the insane asylum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">d) Better Childhoods</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Families try their best. And sometimes children strike lucky. Their parents are well balanced, good teachers, reliably mature and wise. But pretty often parents transmit their confusions and failings to their children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NAMA_Akrotiri_21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NAMA_Akrotiri_21.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="NAMA_Akrotiri_2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="color: #252525;">Minoan youths boxing (BCE 1500), Knossos fresco </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato thought that bringing up children well was one of the most difficult (and most needed) skills. He was acutely sympathetic to the child who is held back by the wrong home environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So he proposed that many children would in fact be better off if they could take their vision of life not from their parents but from wise guardians, paid for by the state. He proposed that a sizeable share of the next generation would be brought up by people more qualified than their own parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plato’s ideas remain deeply provocative and fascinating. What unites them is their ambition and their idealism. He wanted philosophy to be a tool to help us change the world. We should continue to be inspired by his example.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Aristotle was born around 384 BC in the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia, where his father was the royal doctor. He grew up to be arguably the most influential philosopher ever, with modest nicknames like ‘the master’, and simply ‘the philosopher’. One of his big jobs was tutoring Alexander the Great, who soon after went out and conquered the known world.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aristotle studied in Athens, worked with Plato for several years and then branched out on his own. </span>He founded a research and teaching centre called The Lyceum: French secondary schools, lycée, are named in honour of this venture. He liked to walk about while teaching and discussing ideas. His followers were named Peripatetics, the wanderers. His many books are actually lecture notes.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5100826221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4955" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5100826221.jpg?resize=635%2C465" alt="A Great Teacher" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Aristotle was fascinated by how things really work. How does an embryo chick develop in an egg? How do squid reproduce? Why does a plant grow well in one place, and hardly at all in another? And, most importantly, what makes a human life and a whole society go well? For Aristotle, philosophy was about practical wisdom. Here are four big philosophical questions he answered:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1. What makes people happy?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> – the book got its name because it was edited by his son, Nicomachus – Aristotle set himself the task of identifying the factors that lead people to have a good life,  or not. He suggested that good and successful people all possess distinct virtues, and proposed that we should get better at identifying what these are, so that we can nurture them in ourselves and honour them in others.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/173260850.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3403" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/173260850.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Magazine story about Tom Sietsema dinner party" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Aristotle also observed that every virtue seems to be bang in the middle of two vices. It occupies what he termed &#8216;the golden mean&#8217; between two extremes of character. For example, in book four of his <em>Ethics</em>, under the charming title of conversational virtues and vices &#8211; wit, buffoonery and boorishness &#8211; Aristotle looks at ways that people are better or worse at talking to one another.</p>
<p class="p1">Knowing how to have a good conversation is one of the key ingredients of the good life, Aristotle recognised. Some people go wrong because they lack a subtle sense of humour: that&#8217;s the bore, &#8216;someone useless for any kind of social intercourse because he contributes nothing and takes offence at everything&#8217;. But others carry humour to excess: &#8216;the buffoon cannot resist a joke, sparing neither himself nor anybody else, provided that he can raise a laugh and saying things that a man of taste would never dream of saying&#8217;. So the virtuous person is in the golden mean in this area: witty but tactful.</p>
<p class="p1">In a fascinating survey of personality and behaviour Aristotle analyses &#8216;too little&#8217;, &#8216;too much&#8217; and &#8216;just right&#8217; around a whole host of virtues. We can&#8217;t change our behaviour in any of these areas just at the drop of a hat. But change is possible, eventually. Moral goodness, says Aristotle, is the result of habit. It takes time, practice, encouragement. So Aristotle thinks, people that lack virtue should be understood as unfortunate, rather than wicked. What they need isn&#8217;t scolding or being thrown into prison, but better teachers and more guidance.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/table2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8105" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/table2.png?resize=1020%2C399" alt="table2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2. What is art for? </strong></p>
<p class="p1">The blockbuster art at the time was tragedy. Athenians watched gory plays at community festivals held at huge open-air theatres. Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles were household names. Aristotle wrote a how-to-write-great-plays manual,<em> The Poetics</em>. It&#8217;s packed with great tips: for example, make sure to use <em>peripeteia</em>, a change in fortune when, for the hero, things go from great to awful. And<em> anagnorisis</em>, the moment of dramatic revelation when suddenly the hero realises their life is going very wrong &#8211; and is, in fact, a catastrophe.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/900px-Dionysos_satyrs_Cdm_Paris_575.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3397" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/900px-Dionysos_satyrs_Cdm_Paris_575.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="900px-Dionysos_satyrs_Cdm_Paris_575" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">But what is tragedy actually for? What is the point of a whole community coming together to watch horrible things happening to lead characters? Like Oedipus, in the play by Sophocles, who by accident kills his father, gets married to his mother, finds out he&#8217;s done these things and gouges out his eyes in remorse and despair. Aristotle&#8217;s answer is: <em>catharsis</em>. <em>Catharsis</em> is a kind of cleaning: you get rid of bad stuff. In this case, cleaning up our emotions, specifically, our confusions around the feelings of fear and pity.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ve got natural problems here: we&#8217;re hard-hearted, we don&#8217;t give pity where it&#8217;s deserved, and we&#8217;re prone to either exaggerated fears or not getting frightened enough. Tragedy reminds us that terrible things can befall decent people, including ourselves. A small flaw can lead to a whole life unravelling. So we should have more compassion or pity for those whose actions go disastrously wrong. We need to be collectively retaught these crucial truths on a regular basis. The task of art, as Aristotle saw it, is to make profound truths about life stick in our minds.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>3. What are friends for?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In books eight and nine of the <em>Nicomachean Ethics, </em>Aristotle identifies three different kinds of friendship: there&#8217;s friendship that comes about when each person is seeking fun, their chief interest is in their own pleasure and the opportunity of the moment, which the other person provides. Then there are friendships that are really strategic acquaintances. They take pleasure in each other&#8217;s company only insofar as they have hopes of advantage of it.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/706px-Jacopo_Pontormo_-_Portrait_of_Two_Friends_-_WGA181091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4006" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/706px-Jacopo_Pontormo_-_Portrait_of_Two_Friends_-_WGA181091.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="706px-Jacopo_Pontormo_-_Portrait_of_Two_Friends_-_WGA18109" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Then, there&#8217;s the true friend. Not someone who&#8217;s just like you, but someone who isn&#8217;t you, but about whom you care as much as you care about yourself. The sorrows of a true friend are your sorrows. Their joys are yours. It makes you more vulnerable, should anything befall this person. But it&#8217;s hugely strengthening too. You&#8217;re relieved from too small orbit of your own thoughts and worries. You expand into the life of another, together you become larger, cleverer, more resilient, more fair-minded. You share virtues and cancel out each other&#8217;s defects. Friendship teaches us what we ought to be: it is, quite literally, the best part of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>4. How can ideas cut through in a busy world?</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Like a lot of people, Aristotle was struck by the fact that the best argument doesn&#8217;t always win the debate or gain popular traction. He wanted to know why this happens and what we can do about it. He had lots of opportunity for observations. In Athens, many decisions were made in public meetings, often in the <em>agora</em>, the town square. Orators would vie with one another to sway popular opinion.</p>
<p class="p1">Aristotle plotted the ways audiences and individuals are influenced by many factors but don&#8217;t strictly engage with logic or the facts of the case. It&#8217;s maddening and many serious people can&#8217;t stand it. They avoid the market place and populace debate. Aristotle was more ambitious. He invented what we still call rhetoric, the art of getting people to agree with you. We wanted thoughtful, serious and well-intentioned people to learn how to be persuasive, to reach those who don&#8217;t agree already.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Discurso_funebre_pericles.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4899" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Discurso_funebre_pericles.png?resize=635%2C429" alt="Discurso_funebre_pericles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">He makes some timeless points: you have to soothe people&#8217;s fears, you have to see the emotional side of the issue – Is someone&#8217;s pride on the line? Are they feeling embarrassed? – and edge around it accordingly. You have to make it funny because attention spans are short, and you might have to use illustrations and examples to make your point come alive.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;re keen students of Aristotle. Today, philosophy doesn&#8217;t sound like the most practical activity, maybe that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve not paid enough attention recently to Aristotle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">‘Stoicism’ was a philosophy that flourished for some 400 years in Ancient Greece and Rome, gaining widespread support among all classes of society. It had one overwhelming and highly practical ambition: to teach people how to be calm and brave in the face of overwhelming anxiety and pain.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0_Sénèque_-_Musée_du_Prado_-_Cat._144_-_211.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4894" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0_Sénèque_-_Musée_du_Prado_-_Cat._144_-_211.jpeg?resize=627%2C502" alt="Buste de Sénèque, marbre (H. 70 cm ; l. 33 cm ; pr. 23 cm) réalisé par un auteur anonyme au XVIIe siècle. – Œuvre N° cat.

<h5 class="p1">Bust of Seneca, Museo del Prado</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We still honour this school whenever we call someone ‘stoic’ or plain ‘philosophical’ when fate turns against them: when they lose their keys, are humiliated at work, rejected in love or disgraced in society. Of all philosophies, Stoicism remains perhaps the most immediately relevant and useful for our uncertain and panicky times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1317" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Marco_Aurelio_bronzo.jpeg" alt="640px-Marco_Aurelio_bronzo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Statue of Marcus Aurelius, Musei Capitolini, Rome</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many hundreds of philosophers practiced Stoicism but two figures stand out as our best guides to it: the Roman politician, writer and tutor to Nero, Seneca (AD 4-65); and the kind and magnanimous Roman Emperor (who philosophised in his spare time while fighting the Germanic hordes on the edges of the Empire), Marcus Aurelius (AD 121 to 180). Their works remain highly readable and deeply consoling, ideal for sleepless nights, those breeding grounds for runaway terrors and paranoia.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Stoicism can help us with four problems in particular:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Anxiety</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At all times, so many terrible things might happen. The standard way for people to cheer us up when we’re mired in anxiety is to tell us that we will, after all, be OK: the embarrassing email might not be discovered, sales could yet take off, there might be no scandal…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the Stoics bitterly opposed such a strategy, because they believed that anxiety flourishes in the gap between what we fear <em>might</em>, and what we hope <em>could</em>, happen. The larger the gap, the greater will be the oscillations and disturbances of mood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To regain calm, what we need to do is systematically and intelligently crush every last vestige of hope. Rather than appease ourselves with sunny tales, it is far better – the Stoics proposed – to courageously come to terms with the very worst possibilities – and then make ourselves entirely at home with them. When we look our fears in the face and imagine what life might be like if they came true, we stand to come to a crucial realisation: <em>we will cope</em>. We will cope even if we had to go to prison, even if we lost all our money, even if we were publicly shamed, even if our loved ones left us, and even if the growth turned out to be malignant (the Stoics were firm believers in suicide).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1321" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1137px-Jacques-Louis_David_Le_Serment_des_Horaces.jpg" alt="1137px-Jacques-Louis_David_Le_Serment_des_Horaces" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Jacques-Louis David, <span style="color: #222222;">Oath of the Horatii, 1784</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We generally don’t dare do more than glimpse the horrible eventualities through clenched eyelids, and therefore they maintain a constant sadistic grip on us. Instead, as Seneca put it: ‘To reduce your worry, you must assume that what you fear may happen is certainly <em>going</em> to happen.’ To a friend wracked with terror he might be sent to prison, Seneca replied bluntly: ‘Prison can always be endured by someone who has correctly understood existence.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoics suggested we take time off to practice worst-case scenarios. We should, for example, mark out a week a year where we eat only stale bread and sleep on the kitchen floor with only one blanket, so we stop being so squeamish about being sacked or imprisoned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will then realise, as Marcus Aurelius says, ‘that very little is needed to make a happy life.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1322" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Diogenes_-_Walters_37131.jpg" alt="Diogenes_-_Walters_37131" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Jean-Léon Gérôme, Diogenes, 1860</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each morning, a good Stoic will undertake a <em>praemeditatio</em>, a premeditation on all the appalling things that might occur in the hours ahead. In Marcus Aurelius’s stiffening words: ‘Mortal have you been born, to mortals have you given birth. So you must reckon on everything, expect everything.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stoicism is nothing less than an elegant, intelligent dress rehearsal for catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Fury</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We get angry – especially with our partners, our children, and politicians. We smash things up and hurt others. The Stoics thought anger a dangerous indulgence, but most of all, a piece of stupidity, for in their analysis, angry outbursts are only ever caused by one thing: an incorrect picture of existence. They are the bitter fruits of naivety.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cleopatra_-_John_William_Waterhouse.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4887" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cleopatra_-_John_William_Waterhouse.jpg?resize=635%2C463" alt="Cleopatra_-_John_William_Waterhouse" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">John William Waterhouse, Cleopatra, <span style="color: #252525;">1888</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anger is, in the Stoic analysis, caused by the violent collision of hope and reality. We don’t shout every time something sad happens to us, only when it is sad<em> and</em> unexpected. To be calmer, we must, therefore, learn to expect far less from life. <em>Of course</em> our loved ones will disappoint us, <em>naturally</em> our colleagues will fail us, <em>invariably</em> our friends will lie to us… None of this should be a surprise. It may make us sad. It must never – if we are Stoics – make us angry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise person should aim to reach a state where simply nothing could suddenly disturb their peace of mind. Every tragedy should already be priced in. ‘What need is there to weep over parts of life?’ asked Seneca, ‘The whole of it calls for tears.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Paranoia</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is easy to think we’ve been singled out for terrible things. We wonder why it has happened to us. We tear ourselves apart with blame or direct bitter venom at the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoics want us to do neither: it may neither be our, nor anyone else’s, fault. Though not religious, the Stoics were fascinated by the Roman Goddess of fortune, known as Fortuna, whom they took to be the perfect metaphor for destiny. Fortuna, who had shrines to her all over the Empire, was popularly held to control the fate of humans, and was judged to be a terrifying mixture of the generous and the randomly wilful and spiteful. She was no meritocrat. She was represented holding a cornucopia filled with goodies (money, love etc.) in one hand, and a tiller, for changing the course of life in the other. Depending on her mood, she might throw you down a perfect job or a beautiful relationship, and then the next minute, simply because she felt like it, watch you choke to death on a fishbone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fortune21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4890" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fortune21.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="Statue representing the goddess Isis-Fortuna, marble" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Statue of the goddess Fortuna</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an urgent priority for a Stoic to respect just how much of life will always be in the hands of this demented character. ‘There is nothing which Fortuna does not dare,’ warned Seneca.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding this ahead of time should make us both suspicious of success and gentle on ourselves around failure. In every sense, much of what we get, we don’t deserve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task of the wise person is therefore never to believe in the gifts of Fortune: fame, money, power, love, health – these are never our own. Our grip on them must at all times be light and deeply wary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Loss of Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We naturally exaggerate our own importance. The incidents of our own lives loom very large in our view of the world. And so we get stressed and panicked, we curse and throw things across the room.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To regain composure, we must regularly be reduced in our own eyes. We must give up on the very normal but very disturbing illusion that it really matters what we do and who we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1336" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nasa.jpg" alt="nasa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoics were keen astronomers and recommended the contemplation of the heavens to all students of philosophy. On an evening walk, look up and see the planets: you’ll see Venus and Jupiter shining in the darkening sky. If the dusk deepens, you might see some other stars – Aldebaran, Andromeda and Aries, along with many more. It’s a hint of the unimaginable extensions of space across the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos. The sight has a calming effect which the Stoics revered, for against such a backdrop, we realise that none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes have any relevance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing that happens to us, or that we do, is – blessedly – of any consequence whatsoever from the cosmic perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need the Stoics more than ever. Every day confronts us with situations that they understood and wanted to prepare us for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their teachings are dark and sobering yet at the same time, profoundly consoling and at points even rather funny.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They invite us to feel heroic and defiant in the face of our many troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-death-of-seneca-1773.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4892" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-death-of-seneca-1773.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C394" alt="the-death-of-seneca-1773.jpgLarge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Jacques-Louis David, The Death of Seneca, 1773</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Seneca reminded us, ‘Look at your wrists. There – at any time – lies freedom.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To counterbalance the enragingly cheerful and naive optimism of our times, there is nothing better than the bitter-sweet calming wisdom of these ancient sages.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus was born in 341 BC, on the island of Samos, a few miles off the coast of modern Turkey. He had an unusually long beard, wrote over three hundred books and was one of the most famous philosophers of his age.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What made him famous was his skilful and relentless focus on one particular subject: <em>happiness</em>. Previously, philosophers had wanted to know how to be good; Epicurus insisted he wanted to focus on how to be <em>happy</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Few philosophers had ever made such a frank, down-to-earth admission of their interests before. It shocked many, especially when they heard that Epicurus had started a School for Happiness. The idea of what was going on inside was both entirely shocking and deeply titillating. A few disgruntled Epicureans made some damaging leaks about what was going on in the school. Timocrates said that Epicurus had to vomit twice a day because he spent all his time on a sofa being fed luxurious meats and fish by a team of slaves. And Diotimus the Stoic published fifty lewd letters which he said had been written by Epicurus to some young students when he’d been drunk and sexually obsessed. It’s because of such gossip that we still sometimes now use the adjective ‘Epicurean’ to describe luxury and decadence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1363" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Parassita-big.jpg" alt="Parassita-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But such associations are unfounded. The truth about Epicurus is far less sensational – but far more interesting. The Greek philosopher really was focused on happiness and pleasure, but he had no interest in expensive meals or orgies. He owned only two cloaks and lived on bread, olives and – as a treat – the occasional slice of cheese. Instead, having patiently studied happiness for many years, Epicurus came to a set of remarkable and revolutionary conclusions about what we actually need to be happy, conclusions wholly at odds with the assumptions of his age – and of our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Epicurus proposed that we typically make three mistakes when thinking about happiness:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. We think we need romantic relationships</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, as now, people were obsessed with love. But Epicurus observed that happiness and love (let alone marriage) almost never go together. There is too much jealousy, misunderstanding and bitterness. Sex is always complicated and rarely in harmony with affection. It would be best, Epicurus concluded, never to put too much faith in relationships. By contrast, he noted how rewarding most friendships are: here we are polite, we look for agreement, we don’t scold or berate and we aren’t possessive. But the problem is we don’t see our friends enough. We let work and family take precedence. We can’t find the time. They live too far away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1364" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/advert.jpg" alt="A man walks past a billboard advertising" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. We think we need lots of money</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, as now, people were obsessed by their careers, motivated by a desire for money and applause. But Epicurus emphasised the difficulties of employment: the jealousy, the backbiting and frustrated ambitions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/businessmen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4958" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/businessmen.jpg?resize=635%2C384" alt="FSA Gives New Rules To Banks On Employee Bonuses" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes work really satisfying, Epicurus believed, is when we’re able to work either alone or in very small groups and when it feels meaningful, when we sense that we’re helping others in some way or making things that improve the world. It isn’t really cash or prestige we want, it’s a sense of fulfilment through our labour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. We put too much faith in luxury</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We dream of luxury: a beautiful home, elegant rooms and pleasant views. We imagine trips to idyllic locations, where we can rest and let others look after us…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1367" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beachjpg.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH 'Maldives-economy-tourism' Th" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Epicurus disagreed with our longings. Behind the fantasy of luxury, what he believed we really want is calm. Yet calm won’t possibly arise simply through changing the view or owning a delightful building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calm is an internal quality that is the result of analysis: it comes when we sift through our worries and correctly understand them. We therefore need ample time to read, to write, and most of all, to benefit from the regular support of a good listener: a sympathetic, kind, clever person who in Epicurus’s time would have been a philosopher, and whom we would now call a therapist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With his analysis of happiness in hand, Epicurus made three important innovations:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Firstly, he decided that he would live together with friends. Enough of seeing them only now and then. He bought a modestly priced plot of land outside of Athens and built a place where he and his friends could live side by side on a permanent basis. Everyone had their rooms, and there were common areas downstairs and in the grounds. That way, the residents would always be surrounded by people who shared their outlooks, were entertaining and kind. Children were looked after in rota. Everyone ate together. One could chat in the corridors late at night. It was the world’s first proper commune.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11001311306_d93f163be5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8899" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11001311306_d93f163be5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="11001311306_d93f163be5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Secondly, everyone in the commune stopped working for other people. They accepted cuts in their income in return for being able to focus on fulfilling work. Some of Epicurus’s friends devoted themselves to farming, others to cooking, a few to making furniture and art. They had far less money, but ample intrinsic satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/farming.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4959" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/farming.jpg?resize=635%2C370" alt="Live Power Community Farm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Thirdly, Epicurus and his friends devoted themselves to finding calm through rational analysis and insight. They spent periods of every day reflecting on their anxieties, improving their understanding of their psyches and mastering the great questions of philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Epicurus’s experiment in living caught on. Epicurean communities opened up all around the Mediterranean and drew in thousands of followers. The centres thrived for generations – until they were brutally suppressed by a jealous and aggressive Christian Church in the 5th century. But even then, their essence survived when many of them were turned into monasteries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Epicurus’s influence continues into the modern age. Karl Marx did his PhD thesis on him and thought of him as his favourite philosopher. What we call Communism is at heart just a bigger – and rather more authoritarian and joyless – version of Epicureanism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even today, Epicurus remains an indispensable guide to life in advanced consumer capitalist societies because advertising – on which this system is based – functions on cleverly muddling people up about what they think they need to be happy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An extraordinary number of adverts focus on the three very things that Epicurus identified as false lures of happiness: romantic love, professional status and luxury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1373" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/147819621.jpg" alt="Cyclists ride past a large poster advert" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adverts wouldn’t work as well as they do if they didn’t operate with an accurate sense of what our real needs are. Yet while they excite us by evoking them, they refuse to quench them properly. Beer ads will show us groups of friends hugging – but only sell us alcohol (that we might end up drinking alone). Fancy watch ads will show us high-status professionals walking purposefully to the office, but won’t know how to answer the desire for intrinsically satisfying work. And adverts for tropical beaches may titillate us with their serenity, but can’t – on their own – deliver the true calm we crave</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Epicurus invites us to change our understanding of ourselves and to alter society accordingly. We mustn’t exhaust ourselves and the planet in a race for things that wouldn’t possibly satisfy us even if we got them. We need a return to philosophy and a lot more seriousness about the business of being happy.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Augustine was a Christian philosopher who lived in the early 5th century AD on the fringes of the rapidly declining Roman Empire, in the North African town of Hippo (present day Annaba, in Algeria). He served as Bishop for over thirty years, proving popular and inspirational guidance to his largely uneducated and poor congregation. In his last days, a Germanic tribe known as the Vandals burnt Hippo to the ground, destroyed the legions, made off with the town’s young women but left Augustine’s cathedral and library entirely untouched out of respect for the elderly philosopher’s achievements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Saint_Augustine_Portrait1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4906" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Saint_Augustine_Portrait1.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="Saint_Augustine_Portrait1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He matters to us non-Christians today because of what he criticised about Rome, its values and its outlook – and because Rome has so many things in common with the modern West, especially the United States, which so revered the Empire that it wanted its capital city on the Potomac to look as if it might have been magically transported from the banks of the Tiber.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1565" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1024px-US_Capitol_west_side.jpg" alt="1024px-US_Capitol_west_side" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romans believed in two things in particular:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><em>i: Earthly Happiness</em></p>
<p class="p2">They were, on the whole, an optimistic lot. The builders of the Pont du Gard and the Coliseum had faith in technology, in the power of humans to master themselves, and in their ability to control nature and plot for their own happiness and satisfaction. In writers like Cicero and Plutarch, one finds a degree of pride, ambition and confidence in the future which, with some revisions, would not be out of place in Palo Alto or the pages of <em>Wired</em>. The Romans were keen practitioners of what we would nowadays call self-help, training their audiences to greater success and effectiveness. In their eyes, the human animal was something eminently open to being perfected.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Statue-Augustus1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4907" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Statue-Augustus1.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="Statue-Augustus1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="color: #000000;">The Emperor Augustus,  1st century</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">ii: A just Social Order</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For long periods, the Romans trusted that their society was marked by justice: ‘justitia.’ Although inheritance was a major factor, they also believed that people of ambition and intelligence could succeed. The army was trusted to be meritocratic. The capacity to make money was held to reflect both practical ability and also a degree of inner virtue. Therefore, showing off one’s wealth was deemed honourable and a point of pride. Consumption was conspicuous; and fame a wholly respectable ideal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Luca_Giordano_0131.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4908" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Luca_Giordano_0131.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="Luca_Giordano_013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="color: #393c41;">Luca Giordano, Allegory of Justice, c. 1680</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With these two attitudes in particular, Augustine disagreed furiously. In his masterpiece, <em>The City of God</em>, he dissected each one in turn in ways that continue to prove relevant to anyone who might harbour doubts of their own about them – even if his proposed solutions, drawn from Christian theology, will only ever appeal to believers. Augustine’s rebuttals ran like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">i: We’re all lustful, mad, erratic, deluded deviants with no earthly chance of happiness</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was Augustine who came up with the idea of ‘Original Sin’. He proposed that all humans, not merely this or that unfortunate example, were crooked, because all of us are unwitting heirs to the sins of Adam. Our sinful nature gives rise to what Augustine called a ‘libido dominandi’, a desire to dominate, which is evident in the brutal, blinkered, merciless way we treat others and the world around us. We cannot properly love, for we are constantly undermined by our egoism and our pride. Our powers of reasoning and understanding are fragile in the extreme. Lust – a particular concern of Augustine’s, who had spent much of his youth fantasising about women in church – haunts our days and nights. We fail to understand ourselves, we chase fantoms, we are beset by anxieties… Augustine concluded his assault by chiding all those philosophers who ‘have wished, with amazing folly, to be happy here on earth and to achieve bliss by their own efforts.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1568" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Jan_Brueghel_de_Oude_en_Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Het_aards_paradijs_met_de_zondeval_van_Adam_en_Eva-1.jpg" alt="Jan_Brueghel_de_Oude_en_Peter_Paul_Rubens_-_Het_aards_paradijs_met_de_zondeval_van_Adam_en_Eva-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">Jan Brueghel the Elder and Pieter Paul Rubens, Adam and Eve, 1615</h5>
<p class="p2">It might sound depressing, but it may turn out to be a curious relief to be told that our lives are awry not by coincidence but by definition, because we are human, and because nothing human can ever be made entirely straight (perfection being an exclusively prerogative of the divine). We are creatures fated to intuit virtue and love, while never quite being able to secure them for ourselves. Our relationships, careers, countries are necessarily not as we’d want them to be. It isn’t anything we have done – the odds have been stacked against us from the start.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Augustinian pessimism takes off some of the pressure we might feel (especially late at night, on Sunday evenings and at any time after forty) when we slowly come to terms with the imperfect nature of pretty much everything we do and are. We should not rage or feel that we have been persecuted or singled out for undue punishment. It is simply the human condition, the legacy of what we might as well, even if we don’t believe in Augustine’s theology, call ‘Original Sin’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">ii. All hierarchies are unfair; there is no social justice; those at the top naturally won’t all be good or those at the bottom bad – and vice versa</span></em></p>
<p class="p2">Romans had – in their most ambitious moments – thought themselves to be running a society with some strongly meritocratic features.. Family tended to influence opportunity but you couldn&#8217;t get near the top just on that, you had to rely on the genuine virtues and abilities of your own. Above all they saw the grandeur of the Roman State as a sign of the collective merits of the Roman population. They ruled large parts of the earth because they deserved to. Their Empire was the reward for their virtue. It&#8217;s a hugely tempting view today for those on the inside of successful corporations or states &#8211;  to see their great prosperity and power as the just reward for collective merit.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1577" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/romans-in-the-decadence-of-the-empire-1847.jpg" alt="romans-in-the-decadence-of-the-empire-1847" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Thomas Couture, Romans during the Decadence, 1847</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What arrogant, boastful and cruel claims, responded Augustine. There never was nor could ever be ‘justitia’ in Rome or anywhere else on earth. God didn’t give good people wealth and power – nor did he necessarily condemn those who lacked them to poverty. The social order was a complete muddle of the deserving and the undeserving – and moreover, any attempt by human beings to judge who was a good person and who a bad one, was a gross sin, an attempt to appropriate a task that only God could carry out, and would do so only at the end of time, on the day of Judgement, to the sound of trumpets and phalanxes of angels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Augustine distinguished between what he called two cities, the City of Men and the City of God. The latter was an ideal, a heavenly paradise, where the good would finally dominate, where power would be properly allied to justice and where virtue would reign. But men could never build such a city, and should never believe themselves capable of doing so. They were condemned to dwell only in the City of Men, which was a pervasively flawed society, where money could never accurately track virtue. In Augustine’s formulation: ‘True justice has no existence save in that republic whose founder and ruler is Christ.’ That is, the fully fair distribution of reward is not something we can or should expect on earth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Jaume_Huguet_-_Consecration_of_Saint_Augustine_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4909" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Jaume_Huguet_-_Consecration_of_Saint_Augustine_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="640px-Jaume_Huguet_-_Consecration_of_Saint_Augustine_-_Google_Art_Project1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Jaume Huguet, <span style="color: #000000;">The Consecration of Saint Augustine, 1460</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Again, it may sound bleak, but it makes Augustine’s philosophy extremely generous towards failure, poverty and defeat – our own and that of others. Unlike what the Romans might claim, earthly failure is no indication of being an inherently bad person – just as success can’t mean anything too profound either. It is not for humans to judge each other by outward markers of success. From this analysis flows a lack of moralism and snobbery. It is our duty to be sceptical about power and generous towards failure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t need to be Christians to be comforted by both these points. They are the religion’s universal gifts to political philosophy and human psychology. They stand as permanent reminders of some of the dangers and cruelties of believing that life can be made perfect or that poverty and obscurity are reliable indicators of vice.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It seems, at first, weird that we might learn from him. Thomas Aquinas was a medieval saint, said in moments of high excitement to levitate and have visions of the Virgin Mary. He was much concerned with explaining how angels speak and move. And yet…</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/temptation-of-st-thomas-aquinas111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4961" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/temptation-of-st-thomas-aquinas111.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="temptation-of-st-thomas-aquinas11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Thomas Aquinas, comforted by angels </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He continues to matter because he helps us with a problem which continues to bedevil us: how we can reconcile religion with science and faith with reason. Aquinas was both a philosopher and a holy saint. Refusing either to lose his faith or mindlessly believe, he developed a new understanding of the place of reason in human life. Aquinas’s monumental contribution was to teach Western European civilisation that any human being – not just a Christian – could have access to great truths whenever they made use of God’s greatest gift to human beings: reason. He broke a logjam in Christian thinking, the question of how non-Christians could have both wisdom and at the same time no interest in, or even knowledge of, Jesus. He universalised intelligence and opened the Christian mind to the insights of all of humanity from across the ages and continents. The modern world, in so far as it insists that good ideas can come from any quarter regardless of creed or background, remains hugely in his debt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thomas Aquinas was born to a noble family in Italy in 1225. As a young man, he went to study at the University of Naples and there came into contact with a source of knowledge which was just then being rediscovered: that of the Ancient Greek and Roman authors, who had previously been shunned by Christian academics. At university, Aquinas also came under the influence of the Dominicans, a new order of monks who, unlike other groups, believed that they should live in the outside world, rather than a cloister.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/635px-The_Perugia_Altarpiece_Side_Panel_Depicting_St._Dominic11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4962" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/635px-The_Perugia_Altarpiece_Side_Panel_Depicting_St._Dominic11.jpg?resize=635%2C513" alt="635px-The_Perugia_Altarpiece_Side_Panel_Depicting_St._Dominic1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Against the will of his family Aquinas decided to join the order. His family’s questionably pious response was to kidnap him and lock him in a tower they owned. Aquinas wrote desperate letters to the Pope, arguing his cause and pleading to be set free. However, the pope was busy with political matters, and so Aquinas stayed locked up, and passed the time writing letters to Dominican monks and tutoring his sisters. According to one legend, during this time Aquinas’ family even furnished him with a prostitute in a low-cut top in the hopes of seducing him away from his idea of being a monk, but Aquinas drove the young lady away with an iron bar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeing they were getting nowhere, finally, his family unlocked the door and the (in their eyes) wayward Aquinas joined the Dominican order for good. Resuming his interrupted education, Aquinas went to study at the University of Paris, where he was a remarkably quiet student, but an exceptionally prolific author, writing nearly two hundred pieces about Christian theology in less than three decades. His books bear beautiful and strange titles the ‘Summa Theologica’ and ‘Summa contra Gentiles’. He also became a hugely popular and influential teacher, and was eventually allowed by the Dominican leadership to found his own school in Naples. Such was his devotion to knowledge, even at the moment of his death (at the age of forty-nine), he is reputed to have been in the middle of delivering an extended commentary on the Song of Songs. After he died, he was canonised in the Catholic Church and is now the patron saint of teachers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of Aquinas’s central intellectual ambitions was to understand how people could know what was right and wrong – a far from academic concern because, as a Christian, he wanted to know how a person could be sure that their actions would allow them to go to heaven. Aquinas was aware that many ideas which seemed extremely right were not the work of Christians. For example, he especially admired Aristotle: a man utterly unacquainted with the truths of the Gospels. It was in response to this dilemma that Aquinas made a highly important argument for the compatibility of religious belief and rational thought </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many great philosophers were pagans, Aquinas knew, but this did not bar them from insight because, as he now proposed, the world could usefully be explored through reason alone. To explain how this could work, Aquinas proposed that the universe and all its dynamics operated according to two kinds of law: ‘natural law’ and divine ‘eternal law’.</span></p>
<p class="p1">For Aquinas, many ‘laws’ could be worked out from our own experience of the world. We could find out for ourselves how to smelt iron, build an aqueduct or organise a just economy. These were the natural laws. But there were other revealed &#8216;eternal&#8217; laws: that is, things which reason could not arrive at on its own. To know (as he thought) that after our deaths we would be judged by a merciful God or that Jesus was simultaneously human and divine we would have to depend upon revelation in sacred books: we’d have to take them on trust from a higher authority.</p>
<p>In a commentary he wrote on the Roman philosopher Boethius, Aquinas defined a then prevailing assumption: ‘the human mind cannot know any truth unless it is illuminated by light from God.’ This was the view that everything that it is important for us to understand has to come from the single approved source: God. But it was in opposition to this idea that Aquinas argued that ‘it is not necessary that the human mind should be endowed with any new light from God in order to understand those things which are within its natural field of knowledge.’ [<i>Super Boethium De Trinitate </i>question 1, part 1]</p>
<p>The radical move Aquinas was making was to allow important space for ‘natural law’ too. He was standing up for the importance of personal observation and experience. His worry was the Bible was such a prestigious source that it could swamp observation: people would be so impressed by revelation from authority that they would discount the power of observation and what we can discover on our own.</p>
<p>The point Aquinas made was that both natural and revealed eternal law are important. They are not &#8211; he argued &#8211; essentially opposed. The problems comes when we insist exclusively on either one. Which we need to develop depends upon the bias we currently have.</p>
<p>Today the tension between higher authority and personal experience remains, though of course the today ‘revelation’ by a higher authority doesn’t mean consulting the Bible. It means organised science. The modern version is the refusal of any kind of knowledge that doesn’t come with the the backing of experiments, data, mathematical modelling and peer-reviewed journal references.</p>
<p>The arts, literature and philosophy are today in the position Aquinas defined for natural law. They attempt to understand the world on the basis of personal experience, observation and individual thinking. They don’t come the stamp of higher authority (meaning, now, science rather than the Bible).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/d2hej51cni6o0x.cloudfront.net/images/magill/ph_0111201517-Baudelaire.jpg?resize=391%2C500" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5>Baudelaire didn&#8217;t do experiments.</h5>
<p>When Baudelaire declared that ‘Genius is childhood recalled at will’, he could easily be accused of intellectual deception. What research did he do to back this up? Did he consult all the available evidence (in diaries and biographical studies)? Did he look at studies of twins, one of whom was a genius and the other not in order to isolate the relevant factors?</p>
<p class="p1">Aquinas’s contemporaries were broadly aware of the Ancient Greeks and Romans but they took the view that ‘pagans’ simply could not have anything important to say on any topics that they felt really mattered to them. It wasn’t the fault of the ancients &#8211; they lived before Jesus. But they were  held to be in error on the single most important issue of life: religious belief. This seemed so terrible a flaw that nothing else the pagan philosophers thought could be in any way useful or important. Aquinas argued that people who are misguided on some fundamentally things can still have a lot to teach you. He was diagnosing a form of intellectual snobbery.  We have a tendency to dismiss a given idea because of its background : we feel we won’t listen unless it comes from the right place. We might define ‘the right place’ in terms of the labs at MIT rather than the Bible, but the impulse is the same.</p>
<p class="p1">So today, an atheistic modernist sitting in London might find it incredible that they could have anything at all to learn from reading The Gospel of St John. The Bible, they think, is so obviously in error on fundamental points. It contains primitive mistakes about the origins of the word, it is filled with supposed miracles.  Which is similar to the way medieval Christians felt about ancient pagan writers.</p>
<p class="p1">The key point for Aquinas is that natural law is a subsection of eternal law, and it can be discovered through the faculty of independent reason. Aquinas gave as an example Jesus’s injunction to ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. Jesus may have given this idea a particularly memorable formulation, but it has in fact been a cornerstone of moral principles in most societies at all times. How is this possible? The reason, Aquinas argued, is that natural law doesn’t need God’s direct intervention in order to make itself known to man. Just by reasoning carefully, one is intuitively following God’s intentions. Aquinas allowed that in a few situations God works simply through divine law, outside of the limits of human reason; and gave the example of prophetic revelations and the visits of angels. However, most useful knowledge could be found within the realm of natural law.</p>
<p class="p1">Aquinas’s ideas unfolded at a time when Islamic culture was going through very similar dilemmas as Christianity, in terms of how to reconcile reason and faith. For a long time, the Islamic caliphates in Spain, Morocco, and Egypt had flourished, generating a wealth of new scientific knowledge and philosophy. However, due to the increasing influence of rigid religious leaders, they had become more dogmatic and oppressive by the time Aquinas was born. They had, for example, reacted violently against the Islamic philosopher, Averroës (Arabic name Ibn Rushd). Like Aquinas, Averroës had been deeply influenced by Aristotle, and had argued that reason and religion were compatible. However, the caliphates – anxious never to depart from the literal words of God – had made sure Averroës’ ideas were banned and his books burned.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AverroesColor.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3415" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AverroesColor.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="AverroesColor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aquinas read Averroës, and saw that he and the Muslim scholar were engaged on similar projects. He knew that the Muslim world’s increasingly radical rejection of reason was harming what had once been its thriving intellectual culture. It was partly thanks to Aquinas’ ideas that Christianity did not suffer the same process of stultification as Islam.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Though Aquinas was a man of deep faith, he therefore provided a philosophical framework for the process of doubt and open scientific inquiry. He reminds us that wisdom (that is, the ideas we need) can come from multiple sources. From intuition but also from rationality, from science but also from revelation, from pagans but also from monks: he’s sympathetic to all of these; he takes and uses whatever works, without caring where the ideas come from. That sounds obvious, until we notice just how often we don’t do this in our own lives: how often we get dismissive if an idea comes from an (apparently) ‘wrong’ source: someone with the wrong accent, a newspaper with a different political creed to ours, a prose style that seems too complicated, or too simple – or an old lady with a woolly hat.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We generally think that philosophers should be proud of their big brains, and be fans of thinking, self-reflection and rational analysis.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s one philosopher, born in France in 1533, with a refreshingly different take. Michel de Montaigne was an intellectual who spent his writing life knocking the arrogance of intellectuals. In his great masterpiece, the Essays, he comes across as relentlessly wise and intelligent – but also as constantly modest and keen to debunk the pretensions of learning. Not least, he is extremely funny…: ‘to learn that we have said or done a stupid thing is nothing, we must learn a more ample and important lesson: that we are but blockheads… On the highest throne in the world, we are seated, still, upon our arses.’ And, lest we forget: ‘Kings and philosophers shit, and so do ladies.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Michel_de_Montaigne_11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3992" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Michel_de_Montaigne_11.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="Michel_de_Montaigne_1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne was a child of the Renaissance and the ancient philosophers popular in Montaigne’s day had believed that our powers of reason could afford us a happiness and greatness denied to other creatures. Reason allowed us to control our passions and temper the wild demands of our bodies, wrote philosophers like Cicero. Reason was a sophisticated, almost divine, tool offering us mastery over the world and ourselves. But this characterisation of human reason enraged Montaigne. After hanging out with academics and philosophers, he wrote, “In practice, thousands of little women in their villages have lived more gentle, more equable and more constant lives than [Cicero].”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His point wasn’t that human beings can’t reason at all, simply that they tend to be far too arrogant about their brains. “Our life consists partly in madness, partly in wisdom,” he wrote. “Whoever writes about it merely respectfully and by rule leaves more than half of it behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps the most obvious example of our madness is the struggle of living with a human body. Our bodies smell, ache, sag, pulse, throb and age. Montaigne was the world’s first and possibly only philosopher to talk at length about impotence, which seemed to him a prime example of how crazy and fragile our minds are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hans_Baldung_009-397x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3994" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Hans_Baldung_009-397x10241.jpg?resize=397%2C519" alt="Hans_Baldung_009-397x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne had a friend who had grown impotent with a woman he particularly liked. Montaigne did not blame his penis: “Except for genuine impotence, never again are you incapable if you are capable of doing it once.” The problem was the mind, the oppressive notion that we had complete control over our bodies, and the horror of departing from this portrait of normality that had left the man unable to perform. The solution was to redraw the portrait; it was by accepting a loss of command over the penis as a harmless possibility in love-making that one could pre-empt its occurrence – as the stricken man eventually discovered. In bed with a woman, he learnt to,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Admit beforehand that he was subject to this infirmity and spoke openly about it, so relieving the tensions within his soul. By bearing the malady as something to be expected, his sense of constriction grew less and weighed less heavily on him.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nude-man-seated-before-a-curtain-16461.jpgHD_-627x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3996" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/nude-man-seated-before-a-curtain-16461.jpgHD_-627x10241.jpg?resize=554%2C576" alt="nude-man-seated-before-a-curtain-1646.jpgHD_-627x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne’s frankness allowed the tensions in the reader’s own soul to be relieved. A man who failed with his girlfriend and was unable to do any more than mumble an apology, could regain his forces and soothe the anxieties of his beloved by accepting that his impotence belonged to a broad realm of sexual mishaps, neither very rare nor very peculiar. Montaigne knew a nobleman who, after failing to maintain an erection with a woman, fled home, cut off his penis and sent it to the lady “to atone for his offence.” Montaigne proposed instead that:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If [couples] are not ready, they should not try to rush things. Rather than fall into perpetual wretchedness by being struck with despair at a first rejection, it is better… to wait for an opportune moment… a man who suffers a rejection should make gentle assays and overtures with various little sallies; he should not stubbornly persist in proving himself inadequate once and for all. ” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout his work, Montaigne took farts, penises, and shitting as serious topics for contemplation. He told his readers, for example, that he liked quiet when sitting on the toilet: “Of all the natural operations, that is the one during which I least willingly tolerate being disrupted.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Pieter_Bruegel_d._Ä._037.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3422" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Pieter_Bruegel_d._Ä._037.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="640px-Pieter_Bruegel_d._Ä._037" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ancient philosophers had recommended that one try to model oneself on the lives of certain esteemed people, normally philosophers. In the Christian tradition, one should model one’s life on that of Christ. The idea of modelling is attractive; it suggests we need to find someone to guide and illuminate our path. But it matters a lot what kind of portraits are around. What we see evidence for in others, we will attend to within, what others are silent about, we may stay blind to or experience only in shame. Montaigne is refreshing because he provides us with a life which is recognisably like our own and yet inspiring still – a very human ideal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Academia was deeply prestigious in Montaigne’s day, as in our own. Montaigne was an excellent scholar but he hated pedantry. He only wanted to learn things that were useful and relentlessly attacked academia for being out of touch: “If man were wise, he would gauge the true worth of anything by its usefulness and appropriateness to his life,” he said. Only that which makes us feel better may be worth understanding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne noted snobbery and pretension in many areas – and constantly tried to bring us back to earth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Storming a breach, conducting an embassy, ruling a nation are glittering deeds. Rebuking, laughing, buying, selling, loving, hating and living together gently and justly with your household – and with yourself – not getting slack nor being false to yourself, is something more remarkable, more rare and more difficult. Whatever people may say, such secluded lives sustain in that way duties which are at least as hard and as tense as those of other lives.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/John_Mair.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3423" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/John_Mair.jpg?resize=635%2C340" alt="John_Mair" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this vein, Montaigne mocked books that were difficult to read. He admitted to his readers that he found Plato more than a little boring – and that he just wanted to have fun with books: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I am not prepared to bash my brains for anything, not even for learning’s sake however precious it may be. From books all I seek is to give myself pleasure by an honourable pastime… If I come across difficult passages in my reading I never bite my nails over them: after making a charge or two I let them be… If one book wearies me I take up another.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He could be pretty caustic about incomprehensible philosophers:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Difficulty is a coin which the learned conjure with so as not to reveal the vanity of their studies and which human stupidity is keen to accept in payment.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">         </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne observed how an intimidating scholarly culture had made all of us study other people’s books before we study our own minds. And yet, as he put it: “We are richer than we think, each one of us.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may all arrive at wise ideas if we cease to think of ourselves as so unsuited to the task because we aren’t two thousand years old, aren’t interested in the topics of Plato’s dialogues and have a so-called ordinary life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Wga_brueghel_wedding_dance_in_a_barn.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3424" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Wga_brueghel_wedding_dance_in_a_barn.jpg?resize=635%2C441" alt="640px-Wga_brueghel_wedding_dance_in_a_barn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You can attach the whole of moral philosophy to a commonplace private life just as well as to one of richer stuff.” <span class="Apple-converted-space">                           </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was perhaps to bring the point home that Montaigne offered so much information on exactly how ordinary his own life was – why he wanted to tell us,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">That he didn’t like apples</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I am not overfond …of any fruit except melons.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">That he had a complex relationship with radishes</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I first of all found that radishes agreed with me; then they did not; now they do again.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">That he practised the most advanced dental hygiene</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“My teeth…have always been exceedingly good… Since boyhood I learned to rub them on my napkin, both on waking up and before and after meals.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">That he ate too fast</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“In my haste I often bite my tongue and occasionally my fingers.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">And liked wiping his mouth</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I could dine easily enough without a tablecloth, but I feel very uncomfortable dining without a clean napkin… I regret that we have not continued along the lines of the fashion started by our kings, changing napkins likes plates with each course.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trivia perhaps, but symbolic reminders that there was a thinking “I” behind this book, that a moral philosophy had issued – and so could issue again – from an ordinary, fruit-eating soul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/795px-François_Clouet_0021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3998" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/795px-François_Clouet_0021.jpg?resize=635%2C548" alt="795px-François_Clouet_002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no need to be discouraged if, from the outside, we look nothing like those who have ruminated in the past.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Montaigne’s redrawn portrait of the adequate, semi-rational human being, it is possible to speak no Greek, fart, change one’s mind after a meal, get bored with book, be impotent and know none of the Ancient philosophers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A virtuous, ordinary life, striving for wisdom but never far from folly, is achievement enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne remains the great, readable intellectual with whom we can laugh at intellectuals and pretensions of many kinds. He was a breath of fresh air in the cloistered, unworldly, snobbish corridors of the academia of the 16th century – and because academia has, sadly, not changed very much, he continues to be an inspiration and a solace to all of us who feel routinely oppressed by the pedantry and arrogance of so-called clever people.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/François_de_La_Rochefoucauld1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4966" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/François_de_La_Rochefoucauld1.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="François_de_La_Rochefoucauld" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a belief that philosophy, when properly done, should sound dense, forbidding, a little confusing, as if it might have been awkwardly translated from the German. But at the dawn of the modern age lived a French philosopher who trusted in a very different way of presenting his thoughts, a man who wrote a very slim book, barely 60 pages long, that can deservedly be counted as one of the true masterpieces of philosophy, a compendium of acerbic, melancholy observations about the human condition, each of them only a sentence or two long, that retains an exceptional number of timely, wise and oddly consoling lessons for our morally confused and distracted age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Duc de La Rochefoucauld was born in Paris in 1613 and, despite his many initial advantages (wealth, connections, good looks and a very beautiful and ancient name), he had a thoroughly difficult and often miserable life. He fell in love with a couple of duchesses who didn’t treat him well, he ended up in prison after some bungled but honourable political manoeuvering, he was forced into exile from his beloved Paris on four occasions, he never advanced as far as he wanted at court, he got shot in the eye during a rebellion and almost went blind, he lost most of his money and some enemies published what they falsely purported to be his memoirs, full of insults against people whom he liked and depended upon – who then turned against him and refused to believe in his innocence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Madame_de_La_Fayette-11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4972" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Madame_de_La_Fayette-11.jpg?resize=635%2C468" alt="Madame_de_La_Fayette-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After all this – betrayal, imprisonment, impoverishment, injury, plagiarism and libel – La Rochefoucauld can readily be forgiven when he declared that he’d had enough of the active life and would henceforth retreat to quieter contemplative pursuits instead. So he hung up his sword and spent his time in the living rooms of two leading intellectual figures of his day, the Marquise de Sablé and the Comtesse de Lafayette, who regularly invited writers and artists to sit with them in their Parisian salons in order to discuss the great themes of existence – often over lemonade and light snacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The salons rewarded wit and spark. They were not lecture halls or seminar rooms, there was no tolerance for leadenness or pomposity here, so winning over listeners required particular skills that came to shape La Rochefoucauld’s mind and work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was in the salons that La Rochefoucauld developed the literary genre for which he has become known: that of the maxim or aphorism, a pithy statement that deftly captures a dark insight into the human soul, reminding us of a wise and often uncomfortable truth. In good hands, an aphorism should deliver its punch in less than three seconds (one might be competing with the arrival of an asparagus tart).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4968" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="FdeTroyLectureMoliere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">In the salons, La Rochefoucauld perfected and honed the 504 aphorisms which made his name. He watched how his fellow guests reacted and tweaked his work accordingly. His aphorisms covered all manner of psychological topics, though issues of envy, vanity, love and ambition were recurring themes. A typical La Rochefoucauld aphorism begins by addressing the reader with a ‘we’ or ‘one’, inviting consent with gentle coercion. The aphorism then subverts an accepted piety about human nature in a cynical or sceptical direction. It’s in the last third of the sentence that the sting is generally delivered, and it often makes us laugh, as can happen when we are forced to acknowledge the falsity of a previous sentimental or hypocritical position.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps the most classic and perfect of all La Rochefoucauld’s aphorism is:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘We all have strength enough to bear the misfortunes of others.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is closely followed by the equally effective:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘There are some people who would never have fallen in love, if they had not heard there was such a thing.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the no less accomplished:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘He that refuses praise the first time it is offered does it because he would like to hear it a second.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1598296751.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4970" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1598296751.jpg?resize=635%2C361" alt="Title page for Spite of love" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Voltaire said that La Rochefoucauld’s <i>Maxims</i> was the book that had most powerfully shaped the character of the French people, giving them their taste for psychological reflection, precision and cynicism. Behind almost every one of the maxims lies a challenge to an ordinary, flattering view of ourselves. La Rochefoucauld relishes revelations of the debt that kindness owes to egoism and insists that we are never far from being vain, arrogant, selfish and petty – and in fact, never nearer than when we trust in our own goodness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having suffered unduly in its name, he was particularly suspicious of romantic love:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The reason lovers never tire of one another’s company is because they never talk of anything but themselves.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘If one were to judge of love according to the greatest part of the effects it produces, it might very justly pass for hatred rather than kindness.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘To say that one never flirts is in itself a form of flirtation.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It only looks easy. Nietzsche, who was deeply inspired by La Rochefoucauld, wrote aphorisms (collected in his book <i>Human, All Too Human</i>), which sorely lack the Frenchman’s mixture of darkness and good sense:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘A few men have sighed because their women were abducted; most, because no one wanted to abduct them.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">La Rochefoucauld wrote as he did because he wanted his ideas to persuade people whom he knew had little time and would not necessarily be on his side. If most philosophers since have (with the odd exception) felt no need to write with his elegance, wit and concision, it is because they have trusted (fatefully) that, so long as one’s ideas are important, the style in which one delivers them is of no issue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">La Rochefoucauld knew otherwise. Most of us are so distracted, if someone wants to get a point across to us, they must use all the devices of art to seize our attention and cauterise our boredom for the necessary span. The history of philosophy would have been very different if its practitioners had all imagined themselves to be writing for an impatient non-professional audience with meandering minds in the midst of a chatty Parisian salon. The 140 characters of our own digital salons now offer us a second chance to try to put La Rochefoucauld’s inspiring principles to work.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Baruch Spinoza was a seventeenth-century Dutch philosopher who tried to reinvent religion &#8211; moving it away from something based on superstition and ideas of direct divine intervention to being a discipline that was far more impersonal, quasi-scientific and yet also, at all times, serenely consoling.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Spinoza.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7922" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Spinoza.jpg?resize=435%2C561" alt="Spinoza" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baruch &#8211; the word means ‘Blessed’ in Hebrew &#8211; was born in the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam in 1632, a thriving centre of Jewish commerce and thought. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jodenbreestraat_Amsterdam_from_a_map_of_1625.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7923" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jodenbreestraat_Amsterdam_from_a_map_of_1625.png?resize=635%2C470" alt="Jodenbreestraat_Amsterdam_from_a_map_of_1625" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His ancestors were Sephardic Jews, who had fled the Iberian peninsula following the Catholic-inspired expulsion of 1492. Baruch, a studious highly intelligent child, received an intensely traditional Jewish education: he went to the local Jewish school, the yeshiva and followed all the Jewish High holidays and rituals.</span></p>
<p class="p1">But gradually, he began to distance himself from the faith of his ancestors: &#8220;Although I have been educated from boyhood in the accepted beliefs concerning Scripture,&#8221; he later wrote with characteristic caution, &#8220;I have felt bound in the end to embrace other views.”</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His fully fleshed out views were to be expressed in his great work, the <em>Ethics</em>, written entirely in Latin and published in 1677. </span>In the <em>Ethics</em>, Spinoza directly challenged the main tenets of Judaism in particular and organised religion in general:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- God is not a person who stands outside of nature </span></p>
<p class="p1">- There is no one to hear our prayers</p>
<p class="p1">- Or to create miracles</p>
<p class="p1">- Or to punish us for misdeeds</p>
<p class="p1">- There is no afterlife</p>
<p class="p1">- Man is not God’s chosen creature</p>
<p class="p1">- The Bible was only written by ordinary people</p>
<p class="p1">- God is not a craftsman or an architect. Nor is he a king or a military strategist who calls for believers to take up the Holy Sword. God does not see anything, nor does he expect anything. He does not judge. He does not even reward the virtuous person with a life after death. Every representation of God as a person is a projection of the imagination.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Everything in the traditional liturgical calendar is pure superstition and mumbo-jumbo</span></p>
<p class="p1">However, despite all this, remarkably, Spinoza did not declare himself an atheist. He insisted that he remained a staunch defender of God.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">God plays an absolutely central role in Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em>, but it isn’t anything like the God who haunts the pages of the Old Testament.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Spinoza’s God is wholly impersonal and indistinguishable from what we might call variously call nature or existence or a world soul: God is the universe, and its laws; God is reason and truth; God is the animating force in everything that is and can be. God is the cause of everything, but he is the eternal cause. He doesn&#8217;t participate in change. He is not in time. He cannot be individuated</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza writes: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Whatever is, is in God, and nothing can exist or be conceived without God.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout his text, Spinoza was keen to undermine the idea of prayer. In prayer, an individual appeals to God to change the way the universe works.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Spinoza argues that this is entirely the wrong way around. The task of human beings is to try to understand how and why things are the way they are &#8211; and then accept it, rather than protest at the workings of existence by sending little messages up into the sky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Spinoza put it, beautifully but rather caustically:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Whosoever loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, only naive (but perhaps rather touching)  narcissism would lead someone at once to believe in a God who made the eternal laws of physics and then to imagine that this same God would take an interest in bending the rules of existence to improve his or her life in some way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza was deeply influenced by the philosophy of the Stoics of Ancient Greece and Rome. They had argued that wisdom lies not in protest against how things are, but in continuous attempts to understand the ways of the world &#8211; and then bow down peacefully to necessity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philosopher-in-meditation-1632.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7945" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philosopher-in-meditation-1632.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="philosopher-in-meditation-1632.jpg!Large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Rembrandt, <em>Philosopher in Meditation</em> (1632)</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seneca, Spinoza’s favourite philosopher, had compared human beings to dogs on a leash being led by the necessities of life in a range of directions. The more one pulls against what is necessary, the more one is strangled &#8211; and therefore the wise must always endeavour to understand ahead of time how things are &#8211; for example, what love is like, or how politics works &#8211; and then change their direction accordingly so as not to be strangled unnecessarily. It is this kind of Stoic attitude that constantly pervades Spinoza’s philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To understand God traditionally meant studying the Bible and other holy texts. But Spinoza now introduces another idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The best way to know God is to understand how life and the universe work: it is through a knowledge of psychology, philosophy and the natural sciences that one comes to understand God.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In traditional religion, believers will ask special favours of God. Spinoza proposes instead that we should understand what God wants and we can do so in one way above all: by studying everything that is. By reasoning, we can accede to a divine eternal perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza makes a famous distinction between two ways of looking at life, we can either see it egoistically, from our limited point of view, as he put it:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><em><span class="s1">Sub specie durationis &#8211; under the aspect of time</span></em></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Or we can look at things globally and eternally:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">Sub specie aeternitatis &#8211; under the aspect of eternity</span></strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our nature means that we’ll always be divided between the two. Sensual life pulls us towards a time-bound, partial view. But our reasoned intelligence can give us unique access to another perspective &#8211; it can quite literally allow us &#8211; here Spinoza becomes beautifully lyrical &#8211; to participate in eternal totality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/01500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7944" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/01500.jpg?resize=400%2C529" alt="01500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Normally, we call ‘bad’ whatever is bad for us, and good whatever increases our power and advantage, but to be truly ethical means rising above these local concerns. It might all sound forbidding, but Spinoza envisaged his philosophy as a route to a life based on freedom from guilt, from sorrow, from pity or from shame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Happiness involves aligning our will with that of the universe. The universe &#8211; God &#8211; has its own projects and its our task to understand rather than rail against these. The free person is one conscious of the necessities that compel us all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza writes, the wise man, the person who understands how and why things are, &#8220;possesses eternally true complacency (acquiescentia) of spirit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Needless to say, these ideas got Spinoza into very deep trouble. He was excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam in 1656. The rabbis issued a writ known as a cherem against the philosopher:</span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;By the decree of the angels&#8221; &#8211; it went &#8211; &#8220;and by the command of the holy men, we excommunicate, expel, curse and damn Baruch de Espinoza, with all the curses which are written in the Book of the Law. Cursed be he by day and cursed be he by night; cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza was forced to flee Amsterdam and eventually settled in the Hague, where he lived quietly and peacefully as a lens grinder and private tutor till his death in 1677.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Spinoza_in_levensgevaar.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7947" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Spinoza_in_levensgevaar.jpg?resize=400%2C525" alt="Spinoza_in_levensgevaar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza being forced out of the community</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza’s work was largely ignored. In the 19th century, Hegel took an interest, as did Wittgenstein &#8211; and some 20th-century scholars. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But on the whole Spinoza offers us a warning about the failures of philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <em>Ethics</em> is one of the world’s most beautiful books. It contains a calming, perspective-restoring take on life. It replaces the God of superstition with a wise and consoling pantheism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet Spinoza’s work failed utterly to convince any but a few to abandon traditional religion and to move towards a rationalist, wise system of belief.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reasons are in a way simple and banal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza failed to understand &#8211; like so many philosophers before and since &#8211; that what leads people to religion isn’t just reason, but far more importantly, emotion, belief, fear and tradition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Graf_Baruch_Spinoza_Nieuwe_Kerk_Den_Haag_Nederland_-_20080906.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7948" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Graf_Baruch_Spinoza_Nieuwe_Kerk_Den_Haag_Nederland_-_20080906.jpg?resize=635%2C392" alt="Graf_Baruch_Spinoza,_Nieuwe_Kerk,_Den_Haag,_Nederland_-_20080906" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Spinoza&#8217;s grave</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People stick with their beliefs because they like the rituals, the communal meals, the yearly traditions, the beautiful architecture, the music and the sonorous language read out in synagogue or church.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> arguably contains a whole lot more wisdom than the Bible &#8211; but because it comes without any of the Bible’s supporting structure, it remains a marginal work, studied here and there at universities in the west &#8211; while the traditional religion that he thought outmoded in the 1670s continues to thrive and convince people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we’re ever to replace traditional beliefs, we must remember just how much religion is helped along by ritual, tradition, art and a desire to belong: all things that Spinoza, despite his great wisdom, ignored at his peril in his bold attempt to replace the Bible.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immanuel Kant is a philosopher who tried to work out how human beings could be good and kind &#8211; outside of the exhortations and blandishments of traditional religion.</p>
<p>He was born in 1724 in the Baltic city of Königsberg, which at that time was part of Prussia, and now belongs to Russia (renamed Kaliningrad).</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kant_foto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Kant_foto.jpg?resize=635%2C630" alt="Kant_foto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant’s parents were very modest; his father was a saddle maker. Kant never had much money &#8211; which he dealt with cheerfully by living very modestly. It wasn’t until he was in his fifties that he became a fully salaried professor and attained a moderate degree of prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His family were deeply religious and very strict. Later in life, Kant did not have any conventional religious belief, but he was acutely aware of how much religion had contributed to his parents&#8217; ability to cope with all the hardships of their existence &#8211; and how useful religion could be in fostering social cohesion and community.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant was physically very slight, frail and anything but good looking. But he was very sociable and some of his colleagues used to criticise him for going to too many parties. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17_ritrattoHIRES.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9109" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17_ritrattoHIRES.jpg?resize=450%2C620" alt="17_ritrattoHIRES" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When &#8211; eventually &#8211; he was able to entertain, he had rules about conversation; at the start of a dinner party, he decreed that people should swap stories about what had been happening recently. Then there should be a major phase of reflective discourse, in which those present attempted to clarify an important topic; and finally there should be a closing period of hilarity so that everyone left in a good mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He died in 1804, in his eightieth year, in Königsberg &#8211; having rarely felt the need to spend any time outside the city in which he was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant was writing at a highly interesting period in history we now know as The Enlightenment. In an essay called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is Enlightenment </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(published in 1784), Kant proposed that the identifying feature of his age was its growing secularism. Intellectually, Kant welcomed the declining belief in Christianity, but in a practical sense, he was also alarmed by it. He was a pessimist about human character and believed that we are by nature intensely prone to corruption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was this awareness that led him to what would be his life’s project: the desire to replace religious authority with the authority of reason; that is, human intelligence. Kant pursued this grand project in a major series of books with fearsome titles, including:</span></p>
<p><em>The Critique of Pure Reason</em> (1781)</p>
<p><em>Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics</em> (1783)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</em> (1785)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Critique of Practical Reason</em> (1788)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Critique of Judgment</em> (1793)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a book on religion titled, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religion within the Bounds of Reason Alone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (1793), Kant argued that although historical religions had all been wrong in the content of what they had believed, they had latched onto a great need to promote ethical behaviour, which still remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was in this context that Kant came up with the idea for which he is perhaps still most famous: what he called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Categorical Imperative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This strange sounding term first appeared in a horrendously named work, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It states:  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did Kant mean by this? This was only a very formal restatement of an idea that had been around for a long time &#8211; something we meet with in all the main religions: “do unto others as you would have them do unto you”. Kant was offering a handy way of testing the morality of an action or pattern of behaviour by imagining how it would be if it were generally practiced and you were the victim of it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hogarthiandi.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9115" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hogarthiandi.png?resize=635%2C495" alt="hogarthiandi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be tempting to flitch a few pads of paper from the stationery cupboard at work. It seems like a small thing. But if everyone did this, the cupboard and society at large would need a lot of guards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, if you have an affair and keep it quiet from your partner you might feel it’s OK. But the Categorical Imperative comes down against this, because you would have to embrace the idea that it would be equally OK for your partner to have affairs and not tell you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Categorical Imperative is designed to shift our perspective: to get us to see our own behaviour in less immediately personal terms and thereby recognise some of its limitations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant went on to argue that the core idea of the Categorical Imperative could be stated in another way: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Act so as to treat people always as ends in themselves, never as mere means.”</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dido-and-eliza-3-570x398.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9119" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dido-and-eliza-3-570x398.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="dido-and-eliza-3-570x398" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was intended as a replacement for the Christian injunction for universal love: the command to “love one’s neighbour”. To treat a person as an ‘end’ meant keeping in view that they had a life of their own in which they were seeking happiness and fulfilment, and deserved justice and fair treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Categorical Imperative &#8211; Kant argued &#8211; is the voice of our own rational selves, it’s what we all truly believe when we are thinking rationally. It’s the rule our own intelligence gives us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant extended his thinking about the Categorical Imperative into the political sphere. He believed that the central duty of government was to ensure liberty. But he sensed that there was something wrong with the ordinary definition of freedom. It should not be thought of in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">libertarian</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> terms: as the ability to do whatever we want. We are free only when we act in accordance with our own best natures; we are slaves whenever we are under the rule of our own passions or those of others. As he put it, ‘a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So freedom isn’t an absence of government: a free society isn’t one that allows people more and more opportunity to do whatever they happen to fancy. It’s one that helps everyone become more reasonable. The good state represents the rational element in everyone, it rules according to ‘a universally valid will under which everyone can be free.’ Government, ideally, is the external, institutionalised version of the best part of ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be a bit surprising &#8211; at first &#8211; to discover that in 1793, Kant published a major work on beauty and art: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Critique of Judgment</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It might seem like a bit of a sideline for a thinker otherwise concerned with politics and ethics. But Kant held that his ideas about art and beauty were the cornerstones of his entire philosophy.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/An_apple_tree_engraving_by_William_Miller_for_William_Archibald_1818.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="399" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ve been seeing, Kant thought that life involved a constant struggle between our better selves and our passions, between duty and pleasure. Beauty &#8211; Kant especially liked roses, vines, apple trees and birds &#8211; delights us in a very special and important way. It is a reminder of, and goad to, our better selves. Unlike so much else in our lives, our love of beauty is ‘disinterested’. It takes us out of narrow selfish concerns, but in a charming, delightful way &#8211; without being stern or demanding. The beauty of nature is a continual, quiet and insistent reminder of our common universal being. A pretty flower is just as attractive to the tired farmworker as to the prince; the graceful flight of a swallow is as lovely to a child as to the most learned professor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Kant, the role of art is to embody the most important ethical ideas. It’s an extension of philosophy. He held we needed to have art continually before us so as benefit from vivid illustrations and memorable symbols of good behaviour, and thereby keep the wayward parts of ourselves in check.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kant’s books were dense, abstract and highly intellectual. But in them he sketched a highly important project that remains crucial to this day. He wanted to understand how the better, more reasonable parts of our nature could be strengthened so as to reliably win out over our inbuilt weaknesses and selfishness. As he saw it, he was engaged in the task of developing a secular, rational version of what religions had (very imperfectly) always attempted to do: help us to be good.</span></p>

<p class="p1">Arthur Schopenhauer was a German 19th century philosopher, who deserves to be remembered today for the insights contained in his great work: <em>The World as Will and Representation</em>.</p>
<p class="p1">Schopenhauer was the first serious Western philosopher to get interested in Buddhism &#8211; and his thought can best be read as a Western interpretation of, and response to, the enlightened pessimism found in Buddhist thought.</p>
<p class="p1">‘In my 17th year,’ he wrote in an autobiographical text, ‘I was gripped by the misery of life, as Buddha had been in his youth when he saw sickness, old age, pain and death. The truth was that this world could not have been the work of an all loving Being, but rather that of a devil, who had brought creatures into existence in order to delight in their sufferings.&#8217; And like the Buddha, it was his goal to dissect and then come up with a solution to this suffering.</p>
<p class="p1">It is chiefly the fault of universities that Schopenhauer is taught in such an academic way that it has stopped him from being widely known, read and followed. And yet in truth, this is a man who &#8211; no less than the Buddha &#8211; deserves disciples, schools, art-works and monasteries to put his ideas into practice.</p>
<p class="p1">Schopenhauer’s philosophy starts by giving a name to a primary force within us which he says is more powerful than anything else &#8211; our reason, logic or moral sense: and which he terms The Will-to-Life. The Will-to-Life is a constant force which makes us thrust ourselves forward, cling to existence and look to our own advantage. It’s blind, dumb and very insistent. What the Will-to-Life makes us focus on most of all is sex. From adolescence onwards, this Will thrums within us, turns our heads constantly to erotic scenarios and makes us do very odd things &#8211; the oddest of which is fall in love.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer was very respectful of love, as one might be towards a hurricane or a tiger. He deeply resented the disruption caused to intelligent people by infatuations &#8211; or what we’d call crushes &#8211; but he refused to conceive of these as either disproportionate or accidental. In his eyes, love is connected to the most important (and miserable) underlying project of the Will-to-Life and hence of all our lives: having children.</p>
<p>“Why all this noise and fuss about love? Why all the urgency, uproar, anguish and exertion?” he asked. “Because the ultimate aim of all love-affairs… is actually more important than all other aims in anyone’s life; and therefore it is quite worthy of the profound seriousness with which everyone pursues it.”</p>
<p>The romantic dominates life because “what is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation….the existence and special constitution of the human race in times to come.”</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/blogimages.serenataassets.com/pollennation/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Atheist-parents.png?resize=549%2C365" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, we rarely think of future children when we are asking someone out on a date. But in Schopenhauer’s view, this is simply because the intellect “remains much excluded from the real resolutions and secret decisions of its own will.”</p>
<p>Why should such deception even be necessary? Because, for Schopenhauer, we would never reliably to reproduce unless we first had &#8211; quite literally &#8211; lost our minds. This was a man deeply opposed to the boredom, routine, expense and sheer sacrifice of having children.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he argued that most of the time, if our intellect were properly in charge of choosing who to fall in love with, we would pick radically different people to the ones we end up with.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4976" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO111.jpg?resize=635%2C364" alt="20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An illustration from The Sorrows of Young Werther, a novel about the perils of love by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a much-admired acquaintance of Schopenhauer.</span></h5>
<p>But we’re ultimately driven to fall in love not with people we’ll get on with, but with people whom the the Will-to-Life recognises as ideal partners for producing what Schopenhauer bluntly called ‘balanced children.’ All of us are in any case a bit unbalanced, he thought: we’re a bit too masculine, or too feminine, too tall or too short, too rational or too impulsive. If such imbalances were allowed to persist, or were aggravated, in the next generation, the human race would, within a short time, sink into oddity.</p>
<p>The Will-to-life must therefore push us towards people who can, on account of their compensating imbalances, cancel out our own issues &#8211; a large nose combined with a button nose promise a perfect nose. He argued that short people often fall in love with tall people, and more feminine men with more assertive and masculine women.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this theory of attraction led Schopenhauer to a very bleak conclusion: namely, that a person who is highly suitable for producing a balanced child is almost never (though we cannot realise it at the time because we have been blindfolded by the will-to-life) very suitable for us. “We should not be surprised by marriages between people who would never have been friends:  “Love…casts itself on people who, apart from sex, would be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to us. But the will of the species is so much more powerful than that of individuals, that lovers overlook everything, misjudge everything, and bind themselves forever to an object of misery.”</p>
<p>The Will-to-life’s ability to further its own ends rather than our happiness may, Schopenhauer’s theory implies, be sensed with particular clarity in that rather scary, lonely moment just after orgasm: “Directly after copulation the devil’s laughter is heard”.</p>
<p class="p1">Watching the human spectacle, Schopenhauer felt deeply sorry for us. We are just like animals &#8211; except, because of our greater self-awareness, even more unhappy.</p>
<p>There are some poignant passages where he discusses different animals but dwells especially on the mole: a stunted monstrosity that dwells in damp narrow corridors, rarely sees the light of day and whose offspring look like gelatinous worms – but who still does everything in its power to survive and perpetuate itself.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4977" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Close-up_of_mole1.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="640px-Close-up_of_mole" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re just like them and just as pitiful: we are driven frantically to push ourselves forward, get good jobs to impress prospective partners, wonder endlessly about finding The One (imagining they’ll make us happy), and are eventually briefly seduced by someone  long enough to produce a child, and then have to spend the next 40 years in misery to atone for our error.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer is beautifully and comically gloomy about human nature: “There is only one inborn error, and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy… So long as we persist in this inborn error… the world seems to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of being content. That’s why the faces of almost all elderly people are etched with such disappointment.”</p>
<p>Schopenhauer offers two solutions to deal with the problems of existence. The first is for rather rare individuals that he called ‘sages’.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/midlifexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/qantambuddha.jpg?resize=500%2C398" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sages are able, by heroic efforts, to rise above the demands of the Will-to-life: they see the natural drives within themselves towards selfishness, sex and vanity&#8230; and override them. They overcome their desires, live alone (often away from big cities), never marry and quell their appetites for fame and status.</p>
<p>In Buddhism, Schopenhauer points out, this person is known as a monk &#8211; but he recognizes that only a tiny number of us can go in for such a life.</p>
<p>The second and more easily available and realistic option is to spend as long as we can with art and philosophy, whose task is to hold up a mirror to the frenzied efforts and unhappy turmoil created in all of us by the Will-to-Life. We may not be able to quell the Will-to-Life very often, but in the evenings at the theater, or on a walk with a book of poetry, we can step back from the day to day and look at life without illusion.</p>
<p>The art Schopenhauer loved best is the opposite of sentimental: Greek tragedies, the aphorisms of La Rochefoucauld and the political theory of Machiavelli and Hobbes. Such works speak frankly about egoism, suffering, selfishness and the horrors of married life &#8211; and extend a tragic, dignified, melancholy sympathy to the human race.</p>
<p>It’s fitting that Schopenhauer’s own work fitted his own description of what philosophy and art should do perfectly. It too is deeply consoling in its morbid bitter pessimism. For example, he tells us:</p>
<p><em>To marry means to do everything possible to become an object of disgust to each other.</em></p>
<p><em>Every life history is the history of suffering.</em></p>
<p><em>Life has no intrinsic worth, but is kept in motion merely by want and illusion.</em></p>
<p class="p1">After spending a lot of time trying, yet failing to be famous, and trying, yet failing to have a good relationships, towards the end of his life, Schopenhauer eventually found an audience who adored his writings. He lived quietly in an apartment in Frankfurt with his dog, a white poodle whom he called Atman after the world soul of the Buddhists &#8211; but whom the neighbouring children called Mrs Schopenhauer. Shortly before his death, a sculptor made a famous bust of him. He died in 1860 at the age of 72, having achieved calm and serenity.</p>

<p class="p1">He is a sage for our own times, someone whose bust should be no less widespread and no less revered than that of the Buddha he so loved.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in Stuttgart in 1770. He had a very middle-class existence: he was obsessed by his career path and his income. He was a newspaper editor and then a headmaster before becoming an academic professor. He never quite got his hair under control. When he was older, he liked going to the opera. He was very fond of champagne. Intellectually he was adventurous but in externals he was respectable, conventional – and proud of it. He ascended the academic tree, and reached the topmost branch – head of the University of Berlin – in 1830 (when he was 60 years old). He died the following year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hegel1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4911" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hegel1.jpg?resize=635%2C559" alt="Portrait of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel has had a terrible influence on philosophy. He writes horribly. He is confusing and complicated when he should be clear and direct. He tapped into a weakness of human nature: to be trustful of grave-sounding, incomprehensible prose. He made it seem as if the mark of reading deep thought is that one cannot quite understand what is going on. This has made philosophy much weaker in the world than it should be. And the world has paid another heavy price for Hegel’s problems with communication. It has made it much harder to hear the valuable things he has to say to us. Amongst which a small number of lessons stand out:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Important parts of ourselves can be found in history</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel was rare among philosophers in taking history seriously. In his day, a standard European way of looking at the past was to consider it as ‘primitive’ – and to feel proud of how much progress had been made to get us to the modern age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1424" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/greece.jpg" alt="Consulting the Delphic Oracle After 19th century painting. Priestess of temple of Apollo at Delphi (Delphos now Kastri), known as Pythia, most famous Ancient Greek oracle. Position held by celibate woman over 50 whose words were delivered to supplicant i" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Hegel preferred to believe that every era can be looked at as a repository of a particular kind of wisdom. It will manifest with rare clarity certain very useful attitudes and ideas which then become submerged, unavailable or more muddled in later periods. We need to go back in time to rescue things which have gone missing even in a so-called advanced era.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, for example, we might need to mine the history of Ancient Greece to grasp fully the idea of what community could be; the Middle Ages can teach us – as no other era can – about the role of honour; an inspiring vision of how money can pay for art is to be found in the Florence of the 14th century, even if this period featured appalling attitudes to children and the rights of women.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cappella_Tornabuoni_Angel_Appearing_to_Zacharias_03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4025" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cappella_Tornabuoni_Angel_Appearing_to_Zacharias_03.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="Cappella_Tornabuoni_Angel_Appearing_to_Zacharias_03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Domenico Ghirlandaio, Zachariah in the Temple<span style="color: #252525;">, 1486-9</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel held that progress is never linear. The present may be better in some respects,  but is likely to be worse than the past in others. There is wisdom at every stage – which points us to the task of the historian: to rescue those ideas most needed to counterbalance the blind spots of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1">It means that what we might be tempted to call nostalgia may have a tinge of wisdom to it.If people say that life was better in the 1950s or say that they admire Victorian values of thrift, self-reliance and hard work it&#8217;s tempting to tell them that the clock can&#8217;t be turned back and that anyway there was so much wrong with those times that it would be appalling to return to them. But there&#8217;s a more sympathetic attitude that Hegel explored in <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit </em>which he finished in 1807. That&#8217;s the view that each era contains an important insight which is (unfortunately) mired in a confused set of errors. So, of course, it would be terrible to go back in total. but the nostalgia is latching onto what was good. And that good aspect is something wee still need to pay attention to in the present. Hegel imagined an ideal history in which gradually all the good aspects of the past would be liberated from the unfortunate things that accompanied them. And that the best future would gradually amalgamate them all. We need to learn something from the 19th  Century industrialist and form the 1968 hippy, from the medieval bishop and from the 18th century French peasant.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8216;World history &#8216; he says &#8216;is the record of the mind&#8217;s efforts to understand itself.&#8217;  At different points in history, different aspects of the mind are more prominent. The same happens on a micro scale in our own lives. In childhood, wonder or trust may be more to the fore; in late childhood, it might be conformity and the desire to please those thought to be superior; in adolescence, the theme of doubt might get played out conspicuously. later there might be episodes of pragmatism, or the experience of authority or the fear of death. At each of these stages variable we are gradually learning about ourselves and we need to go through them all to fully grasp who we are. The ideal picture of maturity would be accumulated wisdom of what is learn from all of them.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Learn from ideas you dislike</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel was a great believer in learning from one’s intellectual enemies, from points of view we disagree with or that feel alien. That’s because he held that bits of the truth are likely to be scattered even in unappealing or peculiar places – and that we should dig them out by asking always, ‘What sliver of sense and reason might be contained in otherwise frightening or foreign phenomena?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1426" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/glasses.jpg" alt="Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney Campaigns In Wisconsin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nationalism, for instance, has had many terrible manifestations (even in Hegel’s day). So, the temptation of thoughtful people is to give up entirely on this field. But Hegel’s move was to ask what underlying good idea or important need might be hiding within the bloody history of nationalism – a need waiting for recognition and interpretation. He proposed that it’s the need for people to feel proud of where they come from, to identify with something beyond merely their own achievements, to anchor their identities beyond the ego. This is an unavoidable and fruitful requirement, he suggested – something which remains valuable even when some particularly awful movements and politicians have exploited this need and driven it in catastrophic directions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel is a hero of the thought that really important ideas may be in the hands of people you regard as beneath contempt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Progress is messy</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel believed that the world makes progress but only by lurching from one extreme to another, as it seeks to overcompensate for a previous mistake. He proposed that it generally takes three moves before the right balance on any issue can be found, a process that he named the ‘dialectic’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his own lifetime, he pointed out that governments had improved, but far from directly. The flawed, stifling, unfair 18th-century system of inherited traditional monarchy had been abolished by the French Revolution – whose founding fathers had wanted to give proper voice to the majority of people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/uploads4.wikiart.org/images/eugene-delacroix/the-liberty-leading-the-people-1830.jpg?resize=544%2C431" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Eugène Delacroix, <span style="color: #222222;">Liberty Leading the People, 1830</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what should have been the peaceful birth of representative government had ended up in the anarchy and chaos of the Terror. This in turn had lead to the emergence of Napoleon, who had restored order and ensured opportunity for talent and ability – but who had also overreached himself and had become a military brute, tyrannising the rest of Europe and trampling on the liberty he had professed to love. Eventually, the modern ‘balanced constitution’ emerged, an arrangement which more sensibly balanced up popular representation with the rights of minorities and a decent centralised authority. But this resolution had taken at least forty years and incalculable bloodshed to reach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our own time, think of the slow path towards sensible attitudes to sex. The Victorians had imposed too much repression. Yet the 1960s may have turned out to be too liberal. It might only be by the 2020s that we will find the right balance between extremes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1429" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bed.jpg" alt="'Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice' Still" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel takes some of the weight off our backs by insisting that progress will always be slow and troubled. He adds that what happens in history will occur in individuals as well. We too learn slowly and with massive over-corrections. Take the development of our emotional lives. We might, in our 20s, have been with someone so emotionally intense we felt suffocated; we therefore freed ourselves and took up with someone cooler and more reserved; but they might eventually also have become oppressive in their distance. We may be 52 before we get this aspect more or less right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can seem the most appalling waste of time. But Hegel insists the painful stepping from error to error is inevitable, something we must expect and reconcile ourselves to when planning our lives or contemplating the mess in history books or on the nightly news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Art has a purpose</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel rejects the idea of ‘art for art’s sake’. In his most impressive work &#8211; the <em>Introductory lectures on Aesthetics</em> &#8211; he argues that </span>painting, music, architecture, literature and design all have a major job to do. We need them so that important insights become powerful and helpful in our lives. Art is ‘the sensuous presentation of ideas’.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Just knowing a fact often leaves us cold. In theory we believe conflict in Syria is important; in practice we switch off. In principle we know we should be more forgiving to our partners. But this abstract conviction gets forgotten at the least provocation (a crumpled newspaper in the hall, imperfect parking technique).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1430" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/painting.jpg" alt="NETHERLANDS-ART-RIJKS-MUSEUM-VERMEER-RFEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of art, Hegel, realises is not so much to come up with startlingly new or strange ideas; but to make the good, important, helpful thoughts we often already know and make them stick in our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>We need new institutions</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel took a very positive view of institutions and of the power they can wield. The insight of an individual might be profound. But it will be ineffective and transient unless it gets embodied in an institution. Jesus’s ideas about suffering and compassion needed the Catholic Church to take them to the world. Freud’s ideas about the complexity of childhood didn’t become a properly constructive force until they got organised, extended and institutionalised at the Tavistock Clinic in London.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point is for ideas to be active and effective in the world a lot more is needed than that they are correct. This was a point Hegel made again and again in different ways. In order for an idea to be important in a society it needs employees and buildings, training programmes and legal advisors, Institutions allow for the scale of time that big projects need – much longer than the maturity of one individual.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1431" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/138490462.jpg" alt="Cardinal Marc Ouellet presides over the" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The essential function of an institution is to make the major truths powerful in society. (And an institution loses its way when it stops having a profound mission). So, as new needs of a society get recognised they should, ideally, lead to the formation of new institutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nowadays, we might say we need major new institutions to focus on relationships, consumer education, career choice, mood management and how to bring up less damaged children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel put his finger on a crucial feature of modern life: we long for progress and improvement yet we are continually confronted by conflict and evidence of setbacks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His insight is that growth requires the clash of divergent ideas and therefore will be painful and slow. But at least once we know this, we don’t have to compound our troubles by thinking them abnormal. Hegel gives us a more accurate and hence more manageable view of ourselves, our difficulties and where we are in history.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The challenge begins with how to pronounce his name. The first bit should sound like ‘Knee’, the second like ‘cher’: Knee – cher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friedrich Nietzsche was born in 1844 in a quiet village in the eastern part of Germany, where – for generations – his forefathers had been pastors. He did exceptionally well at school and university; and so excelled at ancient Greek (a very prestigious subject, at the time) that he was made a professor at the University of Basel when still only in his mid-twenties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/663px-Nietzsche187a1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4913" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/663px-Nietzsche187a1.jpg?resize=635%2C583" alt="663px-Nietzsche187a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But his official career didn’t work out. He got fed up with his fellow academics, gave up his job and moved to Switzerland and Italy where he lived modestly and often alone. He was rejected by a succession of women, causing him much grief (‘My lack of confidence is immense’). He didn’t get on with his family (‘I don’t like my mother and it’s painful even for me to hear my sister’s voice’) and in response to his isolation, grew a huge moustache and took long country walks every day. For many years, his books hardly sold at all. When he was forty-four, his mental health broke down entirely. He never recovered and died eleven years later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche believed that the central task of philosophy was to teach us how to ‘become who we are’, in other words, how to discover and be loyal to our highest potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To this end, he developed four helpful lines of thought:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>1. Own up to envy</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Envy is – Nietzsche recognised – a big part of life. Yet we’re generally taught to be feel ashamed of of our envious feelings. They seem an indication of evil. So we hide them from ourselves and others, so much so that there are people who will sometimes say, with all sincerity, that they don’t envy anyone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is logically impossible, insisted Nietzsche, especially if we live in the modern world (which he defined as any time after the French Revolution). Mass democracy and the end of the old feudal-aristocratic age had, in Nietzsche’s eyes, created a perfect breeding ground for envious feelings, because everyone was now encouraged to feel that they were equal to everyone else. In feudal times, it would never have occurred to the serf to feel envious of the prince. But now everyone compared themselves to everyone else and was exposed to a volatile mixture of ambition and inadequacy as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/634px-Gustave_Caillebotte_-_Paris_Street_Rainy_Day_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4914" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/634px-Gustave_Caillebotte_-_Paris_Street_Rainy_Day_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="634px-Gustave_Caillebotte_-_Paris_Street_Rainy_Day_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="_xdb" style="color: #222222;">Gustave Caillebotte, <span style="color: #000000;">Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877</span></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there is nothing wrong with envy, maintained the philosopher. What matters is how we handle it. Greatness comes from being able to learn from our envious crises. Nietzsche thought of envy as a confused but important signal from our deeper selves about what we really want. Everything that makes us envious is a fragment of our true potential, which we disown at our peril. We should learn to study our envy forensically, keeping a diary of envious moments, and then sift through episodes to discern the shape of a future, better self.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The envy we don’t own up to will otherwise end up emitting what Nietzsche called ‘sulfurous odours.’ Bitterness is envy that doesn’t understand itself. It is not that Nietzsche believed we always end up getting what we want (his own life had taught him this well enough). He simply insisted that we must become conscious of our true potential, put up a heroic fight to honour it, and only then mourn failure with solemn frankness and dignified honesty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>2. Don’t be a Christian</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche had some extreme things to say about Christianity: ‘I call Christianity the one great curse, the one intrinsic depravity… In the entire New Testament, there is only person worth respecting: Pilate, the Roman governor.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was knockabout stuff, but his true target was more subtle and more interesting: he resented Christianity for protecting people from their envy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/802px-Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4915" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/802px-Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="802px-Bloch-SermonOnTheMount" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Carl Bloch, The Sermon on the Mount, 1877</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity had in Nietzsche’s account emerged in the late Roman Empire in the minds of timid slaves, who had lacked the stomach to get hold of what they really wanted (or admit they had failed), and so had clung to a philosophy that made a virtue of their cowardice. Christians had wished to enjoy the real ingredients of fulfilment (a position in the world, sex, intellectual mastery, creativity) but had been too inept to get them. They had therefore fashioned a hypocritical creed denouncing what they wanted but were too weak to fight for – while praising what they did not want but happened to have. So, in the Christian value system, sexlessness turned into ‘purity’, weakness became “goodness,” submission to people one hated “obedience” and, in Nietzsche’s phrase, “not-being-able-to-take-revenge” turned into “forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity amounted to a giant justification for passivity and a mechanism for draining life of its potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>3. Never drink alcohol</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche himself drank only water – and as a special treat, milk. And he thought we should do likewise. He wasn’t making a small, eccentric dietary point. The idea went to the heart of his philosophy, as contained in his declaration: ‘There have been two great narcotics in European civilisation: Christianity and alcohol.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1382" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Edouard_Manet_A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Bergère.jpg" alt="640px-Edouard_Manet_A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Bergère" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Eduoard Manet, <span style="color: #000000;">A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, 1882</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He hated alcohol for the very same reasons that he scorned Christianity: because both numb pain, and both reassure us that things are just fine as they are, sapping us of the will to change our lives for the better. A few drinks usher in a transient feeling of satisfaction that can get fatally in the way of taking the steps necessary to improve our lives. It’s not that Nietzsche admired suffering for its own sake. But he recognised the unfortunate – but crucial – truth that growth and accomplishment have irrevocably painful aspects: “What if pleasure and displeasure were so tied together that whoever wanted to have as much as possible of one must also have as much as possible of the other. You have a choice in life: either as little displeasure as possible, painlessness in brief or as much displeasure as possible as the price for an abundance of subtle pleasures and joys.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche’s thought recalibrates the meaning of suffering. If we are finding things difficult, it is not necessarily a sign of failure, it may just be evidence of the nobility and arduousness of the tasks we’ve undertaken.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>4. “God is Dead”</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche’s dramatic assertion about the demise of God is not, as it’s often taken to be, some kind of a celebratory statement. Despite his reservations about Christianity, Nietzsche did not think that the end of belief was anything to celebrate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Religious beliefs were false, he knew; but he observed that they were in some areas very beneficial to the sound functioning of society. Giving up on religion would mean that humans would be left to find new ways of supplying themselves with guidance, consolation, ethical ideas and spiritual ambition. This would be tricky, he predicted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4029" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-2.jpg?resize=635%2C507" alt="703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Caspar David Friedrich, <span style="color: #000000;">Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, 1818</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nietzsche proposed that the gap left by religion should ideally be filled with Culture (philosophy, art, music, literature): Culture should replace Scripture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, Nietzsche was deeply suspicious of the way his own era handled culture. He believed the universities were killing the humanities, turning them into dry academic exercises, rather than using them for what they were always meant to be: guides to life. He particularly admired the way the Greeks had used tragedy in a practical, therapeutic way, as an occasion for catharsis and moral education – and wished his own age to be comparably ambitious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He accused university and museum-based culture of retreating from the life-guiding, morality-giving potential of culture, at precisely the time when the Death of God had made these aspects ever more necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche-munch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4031" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche-munch.jpg?resize=635%2C578" alt="Nietzsche-munch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span style="color: #252525;">Edvard Munch, Friedrich Nietzsche, 1906</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He called for a reformation, in which people – newly conscious of the crisis brought on by the end of faith – would fill the gaps created by the disappearance of religion with the wisdom and healing beauty of Culture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every era faces particular psychological challenges, thought Nietzsche, and it is the task of the philosopher to identify, and help solve, these.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Nietzsche, the 19th century was reeling under the impact of two developments: <i>Mass Democracy</i> and <i>Atheism</i>. The first threatened to unleash torrents of undigested envy and venomous resentment; the second to leave humans without guidance or morality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In relation to both challenges, Nietzsche worked up some fascinating solutions – from which our own times have some highly practical things to learn, as he would dearly have wished.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The field is not without other distinguished contestants, but in the competitive history of incomprehensible German philosophers, Martin Heidegger must, by any reckoning, emerge as the overall victor. Nothing quite rivals the prose of his masterpiece <em>Being and Time</em> (1927) in terms of contortions and the sheer number of complex compound German words which the author coined, among them ‘Seinsvergessenheit’ (Forgetfulness of Being), ‘Bodenständigkeit’ (Rootedness-in-soil) and ‘Wesensverfassung’ (Essential Constitution).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Martin-heidegger-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4034" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Martin-heidegger-1.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="640px-Martin-heidegger-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it is likely to be puzzling and perhaps irritating, but gradually, one may warm to the style and understand that beneath its vaporous surface, Heidegger is telling us some simple, even at times homespun truths about the meaning of our lives, the sicknesses of our time and the routes to freedom. We should bother.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was born, and in many ways remained, a rural provincial German, who loved picking mushrooms, walking in the countryside and going to bed early. He hated television, aeroplanes, pop music and processed food. Born in 1889 to a poor Catholic family, he became an academic star after the publication of <em>Being and Time</em> – but made the fatal misstep of taking Hitler at his word in the mid 1930s (he wasn’t alone). He hoped that the Nazis would restore order and dignity to Germany and, to fit in with the mood of the times, he made a few fiery speeches and tried to ban Jewish academics from Freiburg University, where he was rector. One can almost forgive him this period of lunacy, for which he paid dearly and repented for over decades – in his own way. After Germany’s defeat in 1945, he was hauled in front of a Denazification Commission and was forbidden to teach until the end of the decade. Amazingly (it was a testimony to the appeal of his ideas), his career gradually revived, though he spent more and more time in a hut he owned in the woods, away from modern civilisation, until his death in 1976.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/800px-Heideggerrundweg0009.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4037" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/800px-Heideggerrundweg0009.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="800px-Heideggerrundweg0009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout his career, he sought to help us live more wisely. He wanted us to be braver about facing up to certain truths, and to lead richer, more thoughtful, happier lives. Philosophy was no academic exercise. It was – as it had been for the Ancient Greeks – a spiritual vocation and a form of therapy. He diagnosed modern humanity as suffering from a number of new diseases of the soul:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: We have forgotten to notice we’re alive</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know it in theory, of course, but we aren’t day-to-day properly in touch with the sheer mystery of existence, the mystery of what Heidegger called ‘das Sein’ or ‘Being’. Much of his philosophy is devoted to trying to wake us up to the strangeness of existing on a planet spinning in an otherwise seemingly silent, alien and uninhabited universe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s only at a few odd moments, perhaps late at night, or when we’re ill and have been alone all day, or are on a walk through the countryside, that we come up against the uncanny strangeness of everything: why things exist as they do, why we are here rather than there, why the world is like this, why that tree or this house are the way they are. To capture these rare moments when the normal state of things wobbles a little, Heidegger talks, with capital letters, of the Mystery of Being. His entire philosophy is devoted to getting us to appreciate, and respond appropriately to, this rather abstract but crucial concept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Heidegger, the modern world is an infernal machine dedicated to distracting us from the basic wondrous nature of Being. It constantly pulls towards practical tasks, it overwhelms us with information, it kills silence, it doesn’t want to leave us alone – partly because realising the mystery of Being has its frightening dimensions. Doing so, we may be seized by fear (‘Angst’) as we become conscious that everything that had seemed rooted, necessary and oh-so-important may be contingent, senseless and without true purpose. We may ask why we have this job rather than that one, are in a relationship with one person rather than another, are alive when we might so easily be dead… Much of daily life is designed to keep these odd, unnerving but crucial questions at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Munch_Ashes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4035" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Munch_Ashes.jpg?resize=635%2C465" alt="640px-Munch_Ashes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we’re really running away from is a confrontation with – and even non-German speakers might respond to the sonorous depth of this key Heideggerian term – ‘das Nichts’ (The Nothing), which lies on the other side of Being.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Nothing is everywhere, it stalks us, it will swallow us up eventually, but – Heidegger insists – a life is only well lived when one has taken Nothingness and the brief nature of Being on board – as we might do when, for example, a gentle evening light gives way to darkness at the end of a warm summer’s day in the foothills of the Bavarian alps.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We have forgotten that all Being is connected</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We look at the world through the prism of our own narrow interests. Our professional needs colour what we pay attention to and bother with. We treat others and nature as means and not as ends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But occasionally (and again walks in the country are particularly conducive to this realisation), we may be able to step outside our narrow orbit and take a more generous view of our connection with the rest of existence. We may sense what Heidegger termed the Unity of Being, noticing – in a way we hadn’t previously – that we, and that ladybird on the bark, and that rock, and that cloud are all in existence right now and are fundamentally united by the basic fact of Being.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/72985762.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4039" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/72985762.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="Twas Ever So" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Heidegger values these moments – and wants us to use them as the springboard to a deeper form of generosity, an overcoming of alienation and egoism and a more profound appreciation of the brief time that remains to us before ‘das Nichts’ claims us in turn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: We forget to be free and to live for ourselves</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Much about us isn’t, of course, very free. We are – in Heidegger’s unusual formulation – ‘thrown into the world’ at the start of our lives: thrown into a particular and narrow social milieu, surrounded by rigid attitudes, archaic prejudices and practical necessities not of our own making.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The philosopher wants to help us to overcome this ‘Thrownness’ (this ‘Geworfenheit’) by understanding its multiple features. We should aim to grasp our psychological, social and professional provincialism – and then rise above it to a more universal perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In so doing, we’ll make the classic Heideggerian journey away from ‘Uneigentlichkeit’ to ‘Eigentlichkeit’ (from Inauthenticity to Authenticity). We will, in essence, start to live for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1219" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/146553804.jpg" alt="Racegoers Attend The First Day Of Royal Ascot" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet most of the time, for Heidegger, we fail dismally at this task. We merely surrender to a socialised, superficial mode of being he called ‘they-self’ (as opposed to ‘our-selves’). We follow The Chatter (‘das Gerede’), which we hear about in the newspapers, on TV and in the large cities Heidegger hated to spend time in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What will help us to pull away from the ‘they-self’ is an appropriately intense focus on our own upcoming death. It’s only when we realise that other people cannot save us from ‘das Nichts’ that we’re likely to stop living for them; to stop worrying so much about what others think, and to cease giving up the lion’s share of our lives and energies to impress people who never really liked us in the first place. ‘Angst’ about ‘The Nothing’, though uncomfortable, can save us: awareness of our ‘Sein-zum-Tode’ (our ‘Being-toward-death’) is the road to life. When in a lecture, in 1961, Heidegger was asked how we might recover authenticity, he replied tersely that we should simply aim to spend more time ‘in graveyards’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1220" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/114789661.jpg" alt="American Flags Placed At Graves At Arlington Nat'l Cemetery For Memorial Day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: We treat others as objects</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of the time, without quite meaning to, we treat people as what Heidegger terms ‘Equipment’: ‘das Zeug’ – as if they were tools, rather than Beings in Themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cure for this selfishness lies in exposure to great art. It is works of art that will help us to step back from ourselves and appreciate the independent existence of other people and things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1221" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Pair-of-Shoes-A.jpg" alt="Pair-of-Shoes-A" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Heidegger elaborated this idea in the course of a discussion of a painting by Van Gogh of a pair of peasant shoes. Normally, we don’t pay much attention to shoes, they are merely another bit of ‘equipment’ that we need to get by. But when they are presented to us on a canvas, we’re liable to notice them – as if for the first time – for their own sakes.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same might happen to us when confronted by other bits of the natural and the man-made world represented by great artists. Thanks to art, we’ll feel a new kind of ‘Care’ (‘Sorge’) for Being that lies beyond our selves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would be lying to say that Heidegger’s meaning and moral is ever very clear. Nevertheless, what he tells us is intermittently fascinating, wise and surprisingly useful. Despite the extraordinary words and language, in a sense, we know a lot of it already. We merely need reminding and emboldening to take it seriously, which the odd prose style helps us to do. We know in our hearts that it is time to overcome our ‘Geworfenheit’, that we should become more conscious of ‘das Nichts’ day-to-day, and that we owe it to ourselves to escape the clutches of ‘das Gerede’ for the sake of ‘Eigentlichkeit’ – with a little help from the graveyard.</span></p>

<p>Few philosophers have achieved fame as cooks. However, many of their theories can be perfectly explained through the medium of food. Here we inaugurate a new series, Philosophy in the Kitchen, by considering the work of Martin Heidegger, with the help of shrimp, jelly babies and other foods.</p>

<p>A lot of unhappiness comes about in this world because we can&#8217;t let other people know what we mean clearly enough. One of the philosophers who can help us with this is Ludwig Wittgenstein. He was a philosopher, obsessed with the difficulties of language, who wanted to help us find a way out of some of the muddles we get into with words.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Jean-Paul Sartre was born in 1905. His father, a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where he often went to cafes on the Left Bank and sat on benches in the Jardin du Luxembourg. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore distinctive, heavy glasses. He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize for literature, but refused it on the grounds that the award was capitalist and bourgeois. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described himself as ugly. He wore his hair vigorously brushed back. When he died in 1980 (aged 74), 50,000 people accompanied his coffin through the streets of Paris.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/887px-Jean-Paul_Sartre_FP.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4041" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/887px-Jean-Paul_Sartre_FP.jpeg?resize=633%2C447" alt="887px-Jean-Paul_Sartre_FP" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sartre became famous as the key figure in the philosophical movement known as Existentialism. He made thinking and philosophy glamorous. He wrote a dense, hard-to-follow book called <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, which enhanced his reputation not so much because people could understand his ideas but because they couldn’t quite. Sartre was the beneficiary of a desire, which became widespread in the second half of the twentieth century, to revere books for the mystery they appeared to touch, rather than for the clarity of their claims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Existentialism was built around a number of key insights:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Things are weirder than we think</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be highly contingent and even absurd and frightening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sartre’s first novel – <em>Nausea</em>, published in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin, a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings, the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never seen one before – and its material and slight swell makes him think of the repulsive bloated belly of a dead donkey. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/557525221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4043" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/557525221.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="Francois Perier, Paula Dehelly in &quot; The Jean-Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness lurking beneath. Dinner really means that when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up tree and put sections of dead animals and plants in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals you sometimes touch is doing the same. Or think of your job through Sartrean eyes: you and many others swathe your bodies in cloth and congregate in a large box where you make agitated sounds at one another; you press many plastic buttons with great rapidity in exchange for pieces of paper. Then you stop and go away. The next time the sky gets light, you come back.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We are free</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">These weird moments are certainly disorienting and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason: because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think (going to the office, having dinner with a friend, visiting our parents – none of this is obvious or remotely normal), but it’s also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they are. We’re freer than we allow ourselves to imagine amidst the ordinary press of commitments and obligations. It’s only late at night, or perhaps when we’re ill in bed or taking a long train journey somewhere unfamiliar that we give our minds license to daydream in less conventional directions. These moments are at once unsettling and freeing. We could get out of the house, break off a relationship and never see the person we live with again. We might throw in our jobs, move to another country and reinvent ourselves as someone entirely different.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1203" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1137px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="1137px-Van_Gogh_-_Starry_Night_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">We are usually full of reasons why none of that would be possible. But through his descriptions of moments of disorientation, Sartre wants to give us access to a different way of thinking. He wants to push us away from the normal, settled perspective to liberate our imaginations: we might not have to keep taking the bus to work, saying things we don’t mean to people we don’t like or sacrificing our vitality for false notions of security.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘anguish’ of existence. Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along, and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. There is nothing in the non-human order of the world called ‘marriage’ or ‘job’. These are just labels we have put on things and are – as proper existentialists – free to take them off again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is frightening, hence the term ‘anguish’, but Sartre sees anguish as a mark of maturity, a sign that we are fully alive and properly aware of reality, with its freedom, its possibilities and its weighty choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living without taking freedom properly on board. He called it ‘bad faith.’</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we <em>have</em> to do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given place.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1204" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_411879fa.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most famous description of ‘bad faith’ comes in <em>Being and Nothingness</em>, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human being: ‘His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sartre diagnoses him as suffering from <em>bad faith</em>. The man (he was probably modelled on someone in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North Sea trawler. The same attitude of ingrained, option-less servitude might today be observed in an IT manager or a parent collecting their child from school. Each of these might also feel: I have to do what I am doing, I have no choice, I am not free, my role makes me do what I do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1205" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/148466028.jpg" alt="Germany To Face Shortage Of Child Day Care Centers" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Realising one’s freedom in an existential sense should not be confused with the American self-help idea that we’re all free to be or do anything without suffering pain or sacrifice. Sartre is far gloomier and more tragic than this. He merely wants to point out that we have more options than we normally believe – even if in some cases the leading option (which Sartre defended vigorously) might be to commit suicide.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: We’re free to dismantle Capitalism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The one factor that most discourages people to experience themselves as free is money. Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career, leaving a partner) by saying, ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This passivity in the face of money enraged Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, pay people a specific low fee for their work. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom – and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1206" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thread.jpg" alt="Woman at work in Prices candle factory London" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was because of these views that Sartre had a life long interest in Marxism (although he was a critic of the USSR and the French Communist Party). Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations, money and property.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this remains a tantalising thought: could we change politics to regain contact with our fundamental freedoms? How could our attitudes to capital change? How many hours a week should one work? How could what’s on TV or where people go on holiday or the school curriculum be better? How could our toxic, propaganda-soaked media be changed?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite writing a great deal (he was estimated to have written at least five pages every day of his adult life), Sartre did not pursue these lines of thoughts. He opened up possibilities, but the tasks remain ours to undertake.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential, as individuals and as a species.</span></p>
<p class="p2">He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo. Sartre is especially useful to us in adolescence, when parental and social expectations can crush us – and in the darker moments of mid-life, when we recognise there is still a little time to make a change, but no longer quite so much.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Albert Camus was an extremely handsome mid-20th century French-Algerian philosopher and writer, whose claim to our attention is based on three novels, <em>The Outsider</em> (1942), <em>The Plague</em> (1947), and <em>The Fall</em> (1956), and two philosophical essays,<em> The Myth of Sisyphus</em> (1942) and <em>The Rebel</em> (1951).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Albert_Camus_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel_portrait_en_buste_posé_au_bureau_faisant_face_à_gauche_cigarette_de_tabagisme-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7966" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Albert_Camus_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel_portrait_en_buste_posé_au_bureau_faisant_face_à_gauche_cigarette_de_tabagisme-1.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="Albert_Camus,_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel,_portrait_en_buste,_posé_au_bureau,_faisant_face_à_gauche,_cigarette_de_tabagisme (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus won the Nobel prize for literature in 1957 &#8211; and died at the age of 46, inadvertently killed by his publisher Michel Gallimard, when his Facel Vega sports car they were were in crashed into a tree. In his pocket was a train ticket he had decided not to use at the last minute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Untitled-24_105.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7967" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Untitled-24_105.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Untitled-24_105" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus’s fame began with and still largely rests upon his novel, <em>The Outsider</em>. Set in Camus’s native Algiers, it follows the story of a laconic, detached, ironic hero called Mersault &#8211; a man who can’t see the point of love, or work, or friendship &#8211; and who one day &#8211; somewhat by mistake &#8211; shoots dead an Arab man without knowing his own motivations and ends up being put to death &#8211; partly because he doesn’t show any remorse, but not really caring for his fate one way or the other. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The novel captures the state of mind defined by the sociologist Emile Durkheim as<em> anomie</em>,</span> a listless, affectless alienated condition where one feels entirely cut off from others and can’t find a way to share any of their sympathies or values.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/durkheim.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7968" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/durkheim.jpg?resize=635%2C441" alt="durkheim" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Emile Durkheim</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reading <em>The Outsider</em> has long been an adolescent right of passage among French and many other teenagers &#8211; which isn’t a way of doing it down, for a lot of the greatest themes are first tackled at 17 or so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hero of <em>The Outsider</em>, Meursault cannot accept any of the standard answers for why things are the way they are. He sees hypocrisy and sentimentality everywhere &#8211; and can’t overlook it. He is a man who cannot accept the normal explanations given to explain things like the education system, the workplace, relationships and the mechanisms of government. He stands outside normal bourgeois life, highly critical of its pinched morality and narrow concerns for money and family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Camus put it in an afterword he wrote for the American edition of the book: &#8220;Meursault doesn’t play the game. He refuses to lie… he says what he is, he refuses to hide his feelings &#8211; and so society immediately feels threatened.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of the unusual mesmerising quality of the book comes from the coolly-distant voice in which Meursault speaks to us, his readers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The opening is one of the most legendary in 20th-century literature and sets the tone: &#8220;</span>Today mother died. Or maybe yesterday, I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ending is as stark and as defiant. Meursault, condemned to death for a murder committed almost off-hand, because it can be interesting to know what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it’s like to press the trigger, rejects all consolations and heroically accepts the universe’s total indifference to humankind: &#8220;My last wish was that there should be a crowd of spectators at my execution and that they should greet me with cries of hatred.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if we are not killers and will ourselves be really quite sad when our mother dies, the mood of <em>The Outsider</em> is one we are all liable to have some experience of… when we have enough freedom to realise we’re in a cage, but not quite enough freedom to escape it… when no one seems to understand… and everything appears a bit hopeless&#8230;perhaps in the summer before we go to college. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aside from <em>The Outsider</em>, Camus’s fame rests on an essay, published the same year as the novel, called <em>The Myth of Sisyphus.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This book too has a bold beginning:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living, that is the fundamental question of philosophy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason for this stark choice is, in Camus’s eyes, because as soon as we start to think seriously, as philosophers do, we will see that life has no meaning &#8211; and therefore we will be compelled to wonder whether or not we should just be done with it all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To make sense of this rather extreme claim and thesis, we have to situate Camus in the history of thought. His dramatic announcement that we have to consider killing ourselves because life might be meaningless is premised on a previous notion that life could actually be rich in God-given meaning &#8211; a concept which would sound remote to many of us today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, we have to bear in mind that for the last 2,000 years in the west, a sense that life was meaningful was a given, accorded by one institution above any other: the Christian Church.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/687px-Cristo_crucificado.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7971" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/687px-Cristo_crucificado.jpg?resize=635%2C615" alt="687px-Cristo_crucificado" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus stands in a long line of thinkers, from Kierkegaard to Nietzsche to Heidegger and Sartre who wrestle with the chilling realisation that there is in fact no preordained meaning in life. We are just biological matter spinning senselessly on a tiny rock in a corner of an indifferent universe. We were not put here by a benevolent deity and asked to work towards salvation in the shape of 10 commandments or the dictates of the holy gospels. There’s no road map and no bigger point. And it’s this realisation that lies at the heart of so many of the crises reported by the thinkers we now know as Existentialists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A child of despairing modernity, Albert Camus accepts that all our lives are absurd in the grander scheme, but &#8211; unlike some philosophers &#8211; he ends up resisting utter hopelessness or nihilism. He argues that we have to live with the knowledge that our efforts will be largely futile, our lives soon forgotten and our species irredeemably corrupt and violent &#8211; and yet should endure nevertheless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are like Sisyphus, the Greek figure ordered by the gods to roll a boulder up a mountain and to watch it fall back down again &#8211; in perpetuity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/793px-Punishment_sisyph.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7972" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/793px-Punishment_sisyph.jpg?resize=535%2C607" alt="793px-Punishment_sisyph" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But ultimately, Camus suggests, we should cope as well as we can at whatever we have to do. We have to acknowledge the absurd background to existence &#8211; and then triumph over the constant possibility of hopelessness. In his famous formulation:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“One must imagine Sisyphus happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This brings us to the most charming and seductive side of Camus: the Camus who wants to remind himself and us of the reasons why life can be worth enduring &#8211; and who in the process writes with exceptional intensity and wisdom about relationships, nature, the summer, food and friendship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a guide to the reasons to live, Camus is delightful. </span>Many philosophers have been ugly and cut off from their bodies.</p>
<p class="p1">Think of sickly Pascal</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7973" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Blaise_Pascal_Versailles.jpg?resize=635%2C594" alt="Blaise_Pascal_Versailles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sexually-unsuccessful Schopenhauer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/800px-Schopenhauer_1852.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7975" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/800px-Schopenhauer_1852.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="800px-Schopenhauer_1852" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or poor peculiar Nietzsche</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Friedrich_Nietzsche-1872-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7976" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Friedrich_Nietzsche-1872-1.jpg?resize=557%2C616" alt="Friedrich_Nietzsche-1872 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus was by contrast</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Very good looking</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Extremely successful with women: for the last 10 years of his life, he never had fewer than three girlfriends on the go, and wives as well</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Camus_stockholm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7977" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Camus_stockholm.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="Camus_stockholm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- And he had a great dress sense, influenced by James Dean and Humphrey Bogart. It isn’t surprising he was asked to pose by American <em>Vogue</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These weren’t all just stylistic quirks. </span>Once you properly realise that life is absurd, you are on the verge of despair perhaps &#8211; but also, compelled to live life more intensely. Accordingly, Camus grew committed to, and deeply serious about, the pleasures of ordinary life. He said he saw his philosophy as &#8220;a lucid invitation to live and to create, in the very midst of the desert.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was a great champion of the ordinary &#8211; which generally has a hard time finding champions in philosophy &#8211; and after pages and pages of his denser philosophy, one turns with relief to moments when Camus writes in praise of sunshine, kissing and dancing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus was an outstanding athlete as a young man. Once asked by his friend Charles Poncet which he preferred, football or the theatre, Camus is said to have replied, &#8220;Football, without hesitation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soccer-camus1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7979" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/soccer-camus1.jpg?resize=625%2C467" alt="soccer-camus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus played as goalkeeper for the junior local Algiers team, Racing Universitaire d&#8217;Alger (which won both the North African Champions Cup and the North African Cup in the 1930s).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sense of team spirit, fraternity, and common purpose appealed to Camus enormously. When Camus was asked in the 1950s by a sports magazine for a few words regarding his time with the RUA, he said: </span>“After many years during which I saw many things, what I know most surely about morality and the duty of man I owe to sport.&#8221; Camus was referring to the morality he defends in his essays: sticking up for your friends and valuing bravery and fair-play.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus was a great advocate of the sun. </span>His beautiful essay &#8220;Summer in Algiers&#8221; celebrates: &#8220;the warmth of the water and the brown bodies of women.&#8221; He writes: &#8220;For the first time in 2,000 years, the body has appeared naked on beaches&#8230; For 20 centuries, men have striven to give decency to Greek insolence and naivety, to diminish the flesh and complicate dress. Today, young men running on Mediterranean beaches repeat the gestures of the athletes of Delos.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He spoke up for a new paganism, based on the immediate pleasures of the body: &#8220;</span>I recall a magnificent tall girl who had danced all afternoon. She was wearing a jasmine garland on her tight blue dress, wet with perspiration from the small of her back to her legs. She was laughing as she danced and throwing back her head. As she passed the tables, she left behind her a mingled scent of flowers and flesh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9188225305_95f76d95f7_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7981" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9188225305_95f76d95f7_b.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="9188225305_95f76d95f7_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Marrickville Library</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus railed against those who would dismiss such things as trivial and long for something higher, better, purer:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;If there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the grandeur of this one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a letter he remarked: &#8220;People attract me in so far as they are impassioned about life and avid for happiness&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;There are causes worth dying for, but none worth killing for.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Camus achieved huge acclaim in his lifetime, but the Parisian intellectual community was deeply suspicious of him. He never was a Parisian sophisticate. He was a working-class pied-noir (that is, someone born in Algeria but of European origin), whose father had died of war wounds when he was an infant and whose mother was a cleaning lady. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t a coincidence that Camus’s favourite philosopher was Montaigne &#8211; another very down-to-earth Frenchman, and someone one can love as much for what he wrote as for what he was like.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span class="s1">Michel Foucault (1926-1984) </span>was a French 20th-century philosopher and historian who spent his career forensically critiquing the power of the modern bourgeois capitalist state, including its police, law courts, prisons, doctors and psychiatrists. His goal was to work out nothing less than how power worked and then to change it in the direction of a Marxist-anarchist utopia. Though he spent most of his life in libraries and seminar rooms, he was a committedly revolutionary figure, who met with enormous popularity in elite Parisian intellectual circles (Jean Paul Sartre admired him deeply) and still maintains a wide following among young people studying at university in the prosperous corners of the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/foucault_sartre-6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7953" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/foucault_sartre-6.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="foucault_sartre-6" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His background, which he was extremely reluctant ever to talk about &#8211; and tried to prevent journalists from investigating at all costs &#8211; was extremely privileged. Both his parents were very rich, coming from a long line of successful surgeons in Poitiers in west-central France. His father, Dr Paul Foucault, came to represent all that Michel would hate about bourgeois France.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Michel had a standard upper-class education, he went to elite Jesuit institutions, was an altar boy and his parents hoped he would become a doctor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Michel wasn’t quite like other boys. He started self-harming and thinking constantly of suicide. At university, he decorated his bedroom with images of torture by Goya. When he was 22, he tried to commit suicide and was forced by his father, against his will, to see France’s most famous psychiatrist Jean Delay at the Hôpital Sainte-Anne in Paris.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The doctor wisely diagnosed that a lot of Michel’s distress just came from having to keep his homosexuality and, in particular, his interest in extreme sadomasochism away from a censorious society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gradually, Foucault entered the underground gay scene in France, fell in love with a drug dealer, and then took up with a transvestite. For long periods in his 20s, he went to live abroad, in Sweden, Poland and Germany, where he felt his sexuality would be less constrained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the while, Foucault was progressing up the French academic ladder. The seismic event of his intellectual life came in the summer of 1953, when Foucault was 27 &#8211; and on holiday with a lover in Italy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There he came across Nietzsche’s book, <em>Untimely Meditations</em>, which contains an essay called &#8220;</span>On the Uses and Abuses of History for Life&#8221;.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/663px-Nietzsche187a-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7955" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/663px-Nietzsche187a-1.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="663px-Nietzsche187a (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the essay, Nietzsche argued that academics had poisoned our sense of how history should be read and taught. They made it seem as if one should read history in some sort of disinterested way, in order to learn, how it all was in the past. But Nietzsche rejected this with sarcastic fury. There was no point learning about the past for its own sake. The only reason to read and study history is to dig out from the past ideas, concepts and examples which can help us to lead a <strong>better life in our own times</strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This liberated Foucault intellectually as nothing else ever had until then. Immediately, he changed the direction of his work &#8211; and decided to become a particular kind of<strong> philosophical historian</strong>, someone who could look back into the past to help to sort out the urgent issues of his own time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eight years later, he was ready to publish what’s recognised as his first masterpiece:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Madness and Civilisation, 1961</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The standard view is that we now treat people with mental illnesses in so much more of a humane way than we ever did in the past. After all, we put them in hospitals, give them drugs, and get them looked after by people with PhDs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this was exactly the attitude that Foucault wished to demolish in <em>Madness and Civilisation</em>. In the book, he argued that things way back in the Renaissance were actually far better for the mad than they had subsequently become.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/640px-Dance_at_Molenbeek.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7956" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/640px-Dance_at_Molenbeek.jpg?resize=635%2C321" alt="640px-Dance_at_Molenbeek" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Renaissance, the mad were felt to be different rather than crazy. They were thought to possess a kind of wisdom –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>because they demonstrated the limits of reason. They were revered in some circles, and were allowed to wander freely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But then, as Foucault’s historical researches showed him, in the mid-17th century, a new attitude was born that relentlessly medicalised and institutionalised mentally ill people. No longer were they allowed to live alongside the so-called sane, they were taken away from their families, and locked up in asylums and seen as people one should try to ‘cure’ rather than tolerate for just being different.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You can recognise a very similar underlying philosophy in Foucault’s next great book:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Birth of the Clinic, 1963</strong></p>
<p class="p1">His target here was medicine more broadly. He systematically attacked the view that medicine had become more humane with time. He conceded that of course we have better drugs and treatments now, but he believed that in the 18th century, the professional doctor was born, and that he was a sinister figure who would look at the patient always with what Foucault called &#8220;the medical gaze,&#8221; denoting a dehumanising attitude that looked at a patient just as a set of organs not a person. One was, under the medical gaze, merely a malfunctioning kidney or liver, not a person to be considered as a whole entity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next in Foucault’s oeuvre came: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Discipline and Punish, 1975 </strong></p>
<p class="p1">Here Foucault did his standard thing on state punishment. Again, the standard view is that the prison and punishing system of the modern world is much much more humane than it was in the days when people were hung in public squares. Not so, argued Foucault. The problem, he said, is that power now looks kind but isn’t, whereas in the past, it clearly wasn’t kind and therefore, could encourage open rebellion and protest.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault noted that in the past, </span>at an execution, a convict&#8217;s body could become a focus of sympathy and admiration, and the executioner rather than the convict could become the locus of shame; also, public executions often led to riots in support of the prisoner. But with the invention of the modern prison, everything happened in private behind locked gates; one could no longer see and therefore resist state power. That’s what made the modern system of punishment so barbaric and properly primitive in Foucault’s eyes.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault’s last work was the multivolume: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The History of Sexuality, 1976-1984</strong></p>
<p class="p1">The manoeuvres he performed in relation to sex are again very familiar. Foucault rebelled against the view that we are all now deeply liberated and at ease with sex. He argued that since the 18th century, we have relentlessly medicalised sex, handing it over to professional sex researchers and scientists. We live in an age of what Foucault called &#8220;scientia sexualis&#8221; &#8211; science of sexuality.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault looked back in nostalgia to the cultures of Rome, China and Japan where he detected the rule of what he called an <em>ars erotica</em> (&#8220;erotic art&#8221;)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>where the whole focus was on how to increase the pleasure of sex rather than merely understand and label it. Once again, modernity was blamed for pretending there’d been progress, when there was just loss of spontaneity and imagination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault wrote the last volume of this work while dying of AIDS. He died in 1984, aged 58.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault’s lasting contribution is to the way we look at history. </span>There are lots of things in the modern world that we’re constantly being told are fantastic &#8211; and were apparently rather bad in the past. For example:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Education</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- The media</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Or our communication systems</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault encourages us to break away from our optimistic smugness about now to see that, in many ways, there were good things lurking in earlier times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault wasn’t trying to get us to be nostalgic, he wanted us to pick up the lessons of way back in order to improve how we live now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Academic historians have tended to hate Foucault’s work. They think it is inaccurate and keep pointing out things he hadn’t quite understood in some document or other. But Foucault didn’t care for total historical accuracy. History for him was just a storehouse of good ideas and he wanted to raid it, rather than keep it pristine, and untouched.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should use Foucault as an inspiration to look at the dominant ideas and institutions of our times &#8211; and to question them by looking at their histories and evolutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foucault did something remarkable: he made history life enhancing and philosophically rich again. He can be an inspiring figure for our own projects.</span></p>
