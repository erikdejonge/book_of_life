				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In Europe and the US, the average person spends 84% of their life indoors: that is, inside architecture. Much of the rest of the time we are around buildings, even if we’re not paying them a great deal of attention. Despite this massive exposure, on the whole we’re not – as a culture – very ambitious about what buildings look like. We tend to assume that mostly the buildings we live around won’t be anything special and that there’s nothing to be done about this. We’ve come to imagine that great buildings are the unique and very expensive creations of genius-architects. You might travel to see great architecture on holiday perhaps but it’s hardly to be expected as standard at home. Vicenza, 25 miles inland from Venice, is one of the leading sites of global architectural tourism and for one reason: many of the works of Andrea Palladio are located in and around that town.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrea Palladio was born at the end of November in 1508 in Padua. He was an apprentice stone mason and later a stone carver. His real name was Andrea di Pietro della Gondola (i.e. Andrew, son of Peter the Gondolier). And it was only when he was around thirty years of age that he got involved in designing buildings himself – and his first important patron suggested a stylish name change, to <em>Palladio</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[It’s not intuitively obvious how to say his name. A safe bet is to start with ‘pa’ (as in dad); then ‘lad’ as in ‘a bit of a lad’; and finish up with with a brisk ‘ay-oh’: pa-lad-ayoh.]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the next forty years of his working life, Palladio designed forty or so villas, a couple of town houses and a handful of churches. Not a huge list, given the amount of building that was going on at the time. For most of his career he had a mix of professional successes and setbacks; though during his sixties he finally emerged as the top architect<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in Venice – about the richest and most powerful city in the world at that time. He was a devoted father, but his two elder sons – who worked alongside him – died young. Palladio himself died in the summer of 1580. He was 71. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Palladio_filtered.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6273" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Palladio_filtered.jpg?resize=635%2C561" alt="Palladio_filtered" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palladio himself held views on architecture almost entirely opposite to those which are current today. His attitude can be summarised by two central ideas. First, architecture has a clear purpose, which is to help us be better people. And, second, there are rules for good building. Great architecture (he was convinced) is more of a craft than an art: it isn’t necessarily expensive and it is for everyday life, for farms, barns and offices, not only for the occasional glamorous project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The Purpose of Architecture </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend not to ask this question, it can easily sound naive or pretentious. Either you are supposed to know already or someone is about to launch into a complicated disquisition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palladio held that architecture has an important purpose – above and beyond the provision of floors, walls and ceilings. He thought that we should build in order to encourage good states of mind in ourselves and others. In particular, he thought architecture could help us with three psychological virtues: calm, harmony and dignity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Villa-Foscari-La-Malcontenta-by-Andrea-Palladio-piano-nobile.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6274" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Villa-Foscari-La-Malcontenta-by-Andrea-Palladio-piano-nobile.jpg?resize=635%2C606" alt="Villa-Foscari-La-Malcontenta-by-Andrea-Palladio-piano-nobile" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Encouragement for our better nature</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Calm</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SA0309266e_1_x.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6279" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/SA0309266e_1_x.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="SA0309266e_1_x" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He reduces what’s going on; all the elements in a room are centred, balanced, symmetrical. He only uses simple geometrical shapes. Generally, the walls are plain and neutral. There’s not meant to be much furniture. The serenity of the space is designed to calm us down; they are not trying to surprise or excite us. They invite us to focus and concentrate, to be less distracted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larotonda2009.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6280" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larotonda2009.jpeg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Larotonda2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Encouragement to be serene</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Harmony</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palladio was obsessed with making sure that every element of a building fitted perfectly with every other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chiesa_del_Santissimo_Redentore_Venice_Italy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6281" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Chiesa_del_Santissimo_Redentore_Venice_Italy.jpg?resize=635%2C650" alt="Chiesa_del_Santissimo_Redentore,_Venice,_Italy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ‘A fine building ought to appear as an entire and perfect body, wherein every member agrees with its fellow, and each so well with the whole, that it may seem absolutely necessary.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The design of a window is related to that of a door; every opening is aligned with every other; every room is a clear, simple shape; the doors always line up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0be94dd77632489b9898b58c97e9a4761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6288" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/0be94dd77632489b9898b58c97e9a4761.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="0be94dd77632489b9898b58c97e9a476" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">One door leads to another &#8211; Villa Barbaro</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Powerfully coherent buildings are moving because they counter the natural tendency of life for things to get muddled, confused and compromised. They work against our anxiety that many of our concerns won’t line up neatly: that work and home life, sex and love, desire and duty will all be continually fighting one another. The building creates an environment in which we are provided with a limited – but real – sense of everything important coming elegantly together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Villa_Badoer-Barchessa-Scale_Laterali.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6283" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Villa_Badoer-Barchessa-Scale_Laterali.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="Villa_Badoer-Barchessa-Scale_Laterali" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A portion of the world in which elements work harmoniously together</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Dignity</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the ambitions of Palladio’s architecture was to give greater dignity to parts of life that had been, unfairly, regarded as unworthy. And which, in his eyes, lacked the prestige they properly deserved. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the Villa Barbaro – a farmhouse in the countryside about forty miles north of Venice –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the barns and stables and grain stores are just as grand as the owner’s not especially large house. Rather than being hidden away or set at a distance, these working buildings are presented as honourable and important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/palladio__villa_barbaro_maser.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6284" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/palladio__villa_barbaro_maser.jpg?resize=635%2C256" alt="palladio__villa_barbaro_maser" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Villa Barbaro &#8211; the workers lived in the elegant wings</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wasn’t disguising the utilitarian reality of the farm, rather he was demonstrating its genuine (though generally underappreciated) dignity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In directing architecture towards these psychological states, Palladio wasn’t flattering us. He wasn’t pretending that his buildings were reflecting what we’re normally like. He knew perfectly well that people tend to be (then as now) irate and agitated; that dignity is a mask that slips; that we get despondent. He wasn’t trying to give expression to ordinary human nature. In keeping with the long classical tradition, he believed that buildings should try to compensate for our weaknesses: encouraging us to be more collected, poised and measured than we manage to be day to day. We need serene, harmonious and confident buildings precisely because we’re not reliably like that. Ideally, architecture embodies our better selves. The ideal building is like the ideal person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palladio is classically pessimistic about our ability to hold onto ideas; the mind is leaky: we very easily lose contact with our own better nature; we’re very likely to forget, under pressure, what is important to us. The task of architecture is to provides us with the environment that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>continuously reminds about – and encourages us to become – who we really want to be. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Rules</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, we accept that there are lots of useful rules – for airline safety, accounting practices or card games. But we’re generally suspicious of the idea that rules might be important around anything deemed cultural, intimate or creative: the idea that there might be beneficial rules of conversation, art, relationships or indeed of architecture. We tend to see rules as secondary, lacking originality. Like Aristotle, Palladio took the view that many creative undertakings (like writing tragedies, having conversations or cultivating friendships) should be understood as skills or crafts. They are learnable. According to a classical outlook, good outcomes in such areas are not simply to do with luck or chance. And rules ideally capture what it is we need to do in order to do them well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1570, Palladio published his <em>Four Books on Architecture</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Palladio_Titel_1642.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6285" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Palladio_Titel_1642.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="Palladio_Titel_1642" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an early, and very distinguished, example of the ‘how to’ genre. It gives instruction on how to build. There’s a practical guide to digging foundations and how to judge the quality of cement and the various reliable ways of constructing walls and laying floors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also develops rules of proportion, based on simple mathematical ratios. The ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras had famously discovered that two taught strings, one half the length of the other, sound harmonious when vibrated at the same time. The pleasing quality of the sound, he discovered, was governed by a simple mathematical principle. Palladio and others developed a visual equivalent of this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/z644210.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6286" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/z644210.jpg?resize=635%2C664" alt="z644210" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fancy surrounds are not the crucial thing. Without them, the window opening will still look lovely, because it is the proportions and not the decoration that make it harmonious. This meant that an equally beautiful building could be produced more cheaply (always one of Palladio’s chief concerns). Because the same proportions are beautiful irrespective of whether the building is made of marble, brick, concrete or wood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And he went on to provide a wide range of simple rules for making buildings attractive: they should be symmetrical; there should be three, five or seven openings on a side – not an even number; rooms should have a simple geometrical shape, the length should be three-fifths of the width and the height three-fifths of the width. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_inline_n68yybJHKY1serk8o.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6290" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tumblr_inline_n68yybJHKY1serk8o.gif?resize=635%2C575" alt="tumblr_inline_n68yybJHKY1serk8o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Palladio saw himself as a craftsman. He was simply following a set of rules, which others could follow too. He was working against the idea that architecture requires special genius. The ideal of a pattern book is that visually elegant buildings can be put up as standard, as happened (to a significant extent under the influence of Palladio) in London and in many cities in the 18th century. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3250846903_74e45349be_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6292" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3250846903_74e45349be_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3250846903_74e45349be_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A central concern of <em>the Four Books</em> is to educate the potential client or the consumer of architecture. Often, we’re not very sure why we like or dislike buildings. We might have quite positive or negative reactions and say something is great or rather horrible. But if pressed for an explanation, we often find ourselves struggling. We find it difficult to say what it is about about one building that makes it attractive and what makes another unappealing. We’re tempted to say that it’s a purely personal matter, that taste in architecture is purely subjective. It’s a well-intended sentiment. But it’s also unfortunate. It plays into the hands of developers who have no concerns whatever for beauty – who are safe in the knowledge that they will never be taken to task for what they do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Palladio&#8217;s ideas have resonated down the ages. But it isn&#8217;t when buildings have columns or make nods to ancient temples that they are necessarily at their most authentically &#8216;Palladian&#8217;. Buildings are Palladian when they are devoted to calm, harmony and dignity on the basis of rules which can (and should be) widely re-used. It&#8217;s then they display the same underlying ambition of which Palladio is a central exponent and advocate: that it should be normal for buildings to present us with a seductive portrait of our calmest and most dignified selves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We live in a world saturated with false glamour. In truth, the problem does not lie with glamour itself, but with the things we have collectively agreed to regard as glamorous. Progress wouldn’t be found in eradicating the whole idea of glamour from our lives. Instead, what we need to do is direct our admiration and excitement more wisely: to turn it upon the things which genuinely do deserve prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the fundamental things artists can do for us is turn the spotlight of glamour in the best – and most helpful – directions. They can identify things that we tend to overlook but which, ideally, we should care about a great deal. And by the tenderness, beauty, skill and wisdom with which they portray these things, we too can come to see their true worth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4762" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C497" alt="803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Milkmaid, 1657-8</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Serving women – and bread and milk – were not regarded as especially exciting in the late 1650s, when Johannes Vermeer painted this picture. He didn’t seek out a model who was already highly admired. Instead he spent his time looking very carefully at a scene which he happened to love, but which most people at the time would have considered boring and not worth a moment’s consideration.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer saw in the serving woman pouring milk something that he felt deserved prolonged contemplation and admiration. He thought something really important was going on. By worldly standards, it’s a pretty humble situation. The room is far from elegant. But the care with which she works is lovely. Vermeer is impressed by the idea that our true needs might be quite simple. Bread and milk are really rather satisfying. The light coming through the window is beautiful. A plain white wall can be delightful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer is redistributing glamour by raising the prestige of the things he depicts. And he’s trying to get us to feel the same way. The milk maid is a kind of propaganda (or an advert) for homely pleasures. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-16711.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4769" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-16711.jpg?resize=635%2C456" alt="Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-1671" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Lacemaker, 1669-1671</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider the painstaking, skilful – and commercial – business of making lace: Vermeer paints the self-employed business woman with the devotion and care that would, traditionally, be paid to a military hero or a great political leader. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer was born in 1632 in the small and beautiful city of Delft, where his father was a modestly successful art dealer-cum-innkeeper. Vermeer stayed there most of his life. He never travelled away from Delft after his marriage (aged 21). He hardly even left his pleasant house. He and his wife, Catharina, had ten children (and many more pregnancies) and he did a great deal of painting in the front rooms on the upper floor. Vermeer was a slow painter and – in fact – not only a painter. He continued the family businesses of innkeeping and art dealing and he became the head of the local guild of painters. In contemporary terms, his career was not a huge success. He wasn’t especially famous during his lifetime. He didn’t make a lot of money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was in fact an exemplary member of (in those days) a newly important kind of person: the middle-class individual. Vermeer was in his teens when Holland (or technically the Seven Provinces) became an independent state – the first ‘bourgeois republic’ in the world. In contrast to the semi-feudal aristocratic nations that surrounded it, Holland gave honour and political power to people who were not at the pinnacle of society: to merchants, administrators, prosperous artisans and entrepreneurs. It was the first country in the world to be recognisably modern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Johannes_Vermeer_1632-1675_-_The_Girl_With_The_Pearl_Earring_1665-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4771" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Johannes_Vermeer_1632-1675_-_The_Girl_With_The_Pearl_Earring_1665-1.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="Johannes_Vermeer_1632-1675_-_The_Girl_With_The_Pearl_Earring_1665-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Girl with the Pearl Earring, 1665</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great insight of Christianity – which is ultimately detachable from the surrounding theology – is that everyone’s inner life is important, even if on the outside they do not seem particularly distinguished. The thoughts and feelings of an apprentice tailor count for as much (from a spiritual point of view) as those of a General or an Emperor. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer paints <i>The Girl with the Pearl Earring</i> with the same kind of consideration. She isn’t anybody famous or important in the eyes of the wider world. She isn’t rich. The earring that she wears is nice, but it is a minor trinket by the standards of the fashionable world. It is the one rather pricey thing she owns. But she’s not in need of justice – she’s not downtrodden or badly treated by the world. She is (for want of a better term) ordinary. Yet, of course, in herself she is (like everyone) not in the least ordinary: she is uniquely, mysteriously and profoundly herself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4766" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Little Street, 1657-8</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The picture which best sums up Vermeer’s philosophy, <i>The Little Street</i>, has become one of the most famous works of art in the world. It has pride of place in Amsterdam’s great Rijksmuseum; it is insured for half a billion euros and is the subject of a mountain of learned articles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the painting is curiously – and pointedly – out of synch with its status. Because, above all else, it wants to show us that the ordinary can be very special. The picture says that looking after a simple but beautiful home, cleaning the yard, watching the children, darning cloth – and doing these things faithfully and without despair – is life’s real duty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an anti-heroic picture: a weapon against false images of glamour. It refuses to accept that true glamour depends on amazing feats of courage or on the attainment of status. It argues that doing the modest things, that are expected of all of us, is enough. The picture asks you to be a little like it is: to take the attitudes it loves, and to apply them to your life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a good, decent society had a founding document, it could be this small picture. It is a central contribution to the world’s understanding of happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer did not live long. He died in 1675, still only in his early forties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1084px-Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4767" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1084px-Vermeer-view-of-delft.jpg?resize=635%2C349" alt="1084px-Vermeer-view-of-delft" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">View of Delft, 1660-1</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he had communicated a crucial – and hugely sane – idea: much of what matters to us is not exciting, urgent, dramatic or special. Most of life is taken up dealing with things which are routine, ordinary, humble, modest and (to be honest) a touch dull. Our culture should focus on getting us to appreciate the average, the everyday and the ordinary. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Vermeer painted the town where he lived he didn’t choose a special day; the sky is neither very overcast nor especially sunny. Nothing is happening. No celebrities are around. Yet it is, as he has taught us to recognise, all very special indeed.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the unexpectedly important things that art can do for us is teach us how to suffer. It can do so by evoking scenes that are dark, melancholy or painful, and that normalise and lend dignity to the suffering we may ourselves be experiencing in isolation and confusion. They reveal – with grandeur and technical skill – that grief belongs to the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caspar David Friedrich, a painter of sublime sadness, was born in 1774 in Greifswald, an ancient trading town in the far north of Germany, on the Baltic coast. It was a beautiful place in a severe, northern sort of way. As a child he loved the way the pinnacles, spires and towers of the town loomed up above the trees in the haze of very early summer mornings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_043.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4774" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_043.jpg?resize=635%2C391" alt="640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_043" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Meadows near Greifswald, 1822</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His father was a modest artisan of few words and little warmth. His beloved mother died when he was only a young child. When he was thirteen, he saw his younger brother, Johann Christoffer, fall through the ice of a frozen lake and drown.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspardavidfriedrich_self1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4775" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspardavidfriedrich_self1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="Caspardavidfriedrich_self1-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-Portrait, 1800</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He grew up taciturn, intense and shy. He was trained as a painter from an early age, but it was many years of poverty and hardship before his own distinctive style began to emerge. The taste of the era favoured sunny, classical landscapes. Italy in summer was the ideal. But Friedrich was drawn to aspects of nature that – up to that point – people had thought of as disagreeable and uninteresting: cold damp mornings; glacial nights by the sea; the pale hour before the sun rises; the flooded fields of late spring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_0071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4776" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_0071.jpg?resize=635%2C375" alt="640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Grosse Gehege, near Dresden, 1832</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friedrich’s first mature work – the first big picture in which he started to present his own view of life – was a shock to his contemporaries. Instead of the conventional angels, weeping saints and soldiers he depicted the crucifixion of Jesus as happening on top of a mountainous crag amidst Teutonic fir trees, with the sun’s rays striking the clouds behind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/863px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Das_Kreuz_im_Gebirge-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4777" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/863px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Das_Kreuz_im_Gebirge-1.jpg?resize=635%2C503" alt="863px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Das_Kreuz_im_Gebirge-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cross in the Mountains, 1808</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Friedrich realised then that nature could express many of the solemn moods previously associated with a literal rendition of the Christian story. With time, he dispensed with direct references to Jesus altogether, but he kept the atmosphere of tragedy and grief associated with his life and death. He found that tall trees, mountains, mists, jagged reefs, the rising of the moon, the stillness of water at night, open heathland and fog could carry many of the same messages about pain, love, suffering and redemption as Christian theologians had once found in the Gospels. He remains a painter uniquely suited for those who no longer believe, but are attracted to the serious emotions that accompany belief.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Landscape_with_Graves_c._1835-1837_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4778" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Landscape_with_Graves_c._1835-1837_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Landscape_with_Graves_c._1835-1837_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Landscape with Graves, 1835-7</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1818, when he was 44, Caspar David married 25-year-old Christiane Caroline Bommer. They had three children: two daughters, Emma and Agnes Adelheid, and a son, Gustav Adolf. It seems to have been, on the whole, a good relationship. Caroline appears in many of his pictures, but always alone. He was drawn to painting men and women on their own, as if what is most important about us only comes to the surface when we are away from the chatter of civilisation. He himself had only a handful of friends and almost never left his simply furnished studio.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Woman at a Window, 1822</span></h5>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-41.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4780" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-41.jpg?resize=635%2C459" alt="703px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog-41" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, 1817-18</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of solitude being something to evade (with business, drink, or sexual fantasies), Friedrich suggests it as a state that brings us into contact with our deepest possibilities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also believed that the harshness of nature could put the sorrows of the human condition into a consoling, redeeming perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4781" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_006.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="640px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_006" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Sea of Ice, 1824</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Humans can be as cruel, fate can be as remorseless, but contemplating the ineluctable collision of ice packs takes us out of ourselves, beyond the particular envy, wound or disappointment that is tormenting us, reducing our sense of personal persecution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1177px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4782" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1177px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project-1.jpg?resize=635%2C403" alt="1177px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Moonrise over the Sea, 1822</span></h5>
<p>Works like <em>Moonrise over the Sea</em>, make us aware of our insignificance, exciting a sense of how petty man’s disasters are in comparison with the ways of eternity, leaving us a little readier to bow to the incomprehensible tragedies that every life entails. From here ordinary irritations and worries are neutralised. Rather than try to redress our humiliations by insisting on our wronged importance, we can – through the help of a great art work – endeavour to apprehend and appreciate our essential nothingness.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-ReefsbytheSeashore1824-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4783" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-ReefsbytheSeashore1824-1.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="640px-ReefsbytheSeashore1824-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Rocky Reef on the Sea Shore, 1824</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here Friedrich uses a striking, jagged rock formation, a spare stretch of coast, the bright horizon, far away clouds and a pale sky to induce us into a mood of redemptive sadness. We might imagine walking in the pre-dawn, after a sleepless night, on the bleak headland, away from human company, alone with the basic forces of nature. The smaller islands of rock were once as dramatic and thrusting as the major formation just beyond. The long, slow passage of time will, one day, wear them down as well. The first portion of the sky is formless and empty, a pure silvery nothingness, but above them are clouds which catch the light on their undersides and pass on in their pointless, transient way, indifferent to all of our concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The picture does not refer directly to our relationships or to the stresses and tribulations of our day to day lives. Its function is to give us access to a state of mind in which we are acutely conscious of the largeness of time and space and of the insignificance of our situation within the greater scheme. The work is sombre, rather than sad; calm, but not despairing. And in that condition of mind – that state of soul, to put it more romantically – we are left, as so often with Friedrich’s work, better equipped to deal with the intense, intractable and particular griefs that lie before us in the days ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like many artists, Friedrich was not terribly successful. He was admired and his work purchased by a small number of serious people (and two of the most delightful painters of the era, Kersting and Dahl, were his friends). He died in his mid-sixties, in 1840, almost forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/698px-Georg_Friedrich_Kersting_002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4784" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/698px-Georg_Friedrich_Kersting_002.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="698px-Georg_Friedrich_Kersting_002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Georg Friedrich Kersting, Caspar David Friedrich in his Studio, 1819</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He did not know how that, in the distant future, his work would be deeply admired – not because it cheers us, but precisely because it knows how to reframe and express the saddest parts of all of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-985" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1013px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Cairn_in_Snow_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg" alt="1013px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Cairn_in_Snow_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cultural elite gets nervous about cheerful or sweet art. They worry that pretty, happy works of art are in denial about how bad the state of the world is and how much suffering there is in almost every life.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/seated-woman-back-turned-to-the-open-window-1922.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4787" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/seated-woman-back-turned-to-the-open-window-1922.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="seated-woman-back-turned-to-the-open-window-1922" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Seated Woman, Back Turned to the Open Window, 1922</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Look at this picture of sailing boats shooting about in the Med, beyond the palm trees, while a chinzy looking woman sits on a sofa. Has the artist forgotten that the world is filled with inequality, corruption and war? The fear is that we might be so absorbed in having a nice time that we forget about the bad things – and therefore won’t trouble ourselves to do anything about them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, these worries are generally misplaced. Far from taking too rosy and sentimental a view, most of the time, we suffer from excessive gloom. We are only too aware of the problems and injustices of the world. Our problem is actually that we feel debilitatingly small and weak in the face of them. It’s because we feel overwhelmed and hopeless that we recoil into ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cheerfulness is an achievement and hope is something to celebrate. If optimism is important, it is because many outcomes are determined by how much of it we bring to the task. It is an important ingredient of success. This flies in the face of an elite view that skill is the primary requirement of a good life. Yet in many cases, the difference between success and failure can be determined by nothing more than one’s sense of what is possible and the energy one can muster to convince others of one’s due. One can be doomed not by a lack of talent, but by an absence of hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rarely are today’s problems created by people taking too sunny a view of things; it is because the troubles of the world are so continually brought to our attention that we stand in need of tools which can preserve our more hopeful dispositions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-999" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-La_danse_I_by_Matisse-1.jpg" alt="640px-La_danse_I_by_Matisse-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What hope might look like. Dance (I), 1909</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dancers in Matisse’s <i>Dance</i> are not in denial of the troubles of this planet. But from within a normally imperfect and conflicted relationship with reality, one can look at their attitudes as an encouragement; they put one in touch with a blithe, carefree part of oneself which can help one in coping with the inevitable rejections and humiliations. The picture should not be seen as suggesting that all is well: and that, despite the evidence of experience, women always take delight in each other’s existence and bond together in mutually supportive networks.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matisse himself knew a huge amount about suffering (which builds our confidence in his pleasing, hopeful, charming work) – as a glance at one of his self-portraits shows. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_19061.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4795" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_19061.jpg?resize=635%2C541" alt="Henri_Matisse_Self-Portrait_in_a_Striped_T-shirt_1906" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Self-Portrait in a Striped T-shirt, 1906</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matisse knew all about tragedy but his acquaintance with it made him all the more alive to its opposites. As he saw it, the real problem was that darkness and misery are so likely to overpower us that we actually need to make a deliberate effort to remind ourselves of cheerful and hopeful things.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matisse was born in 1869 into a relatively prosperous family. His father was a hardware and grain merchant. He wasn’t supposed to be an artist. His father was very keen that he should have a safe, respectable – and lucrative – career as a lawyer. In his twenties he became desperate to give up his day job in the law office but his father was strongly opposed. Eventually he relented and agreed that Matisse could study – but only so long as he kept to the most traditional and conservative style. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/not-identified-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4789" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/not-identified-1.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="not-identified-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Still Life with Books, 1890. (Message from his father: you keep on painting like this and I’ll keep paying your allowance)</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to develop as a painter of joyful, bright and sensuous pictures, Matisse had to face down his father, embrace poverty (when all family support was cut off) and be reviled by his teachers and mentors. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the years before the outbreak of the First World War Matisse started to build up a successful career. He was selling a few pictures. He was getting well known in adventurous artistic circles. Just as he seemed to be making it, the whole world started to fall apart. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the year of the Battle of the Somme, he painted <i>The Window</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/matisse-window1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4797" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/matisse-window1.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="matisse-window" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Window (Interior with Forget-Me-Nots), 1916</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not that Matisse didn’t care about the trenches, a day’s journey from Paris. It intensified his sense of the loveliness of the trunk of a tree just glimpsed through the gap in the curtains, or his delight in the pattern of the floorboards – and the overall freshness and charm of a bowl of flowers in an elegant, but unpretentious room in the city. It’s as if he is reminding himself (and us) that these things are still here. They haven’t been destroyed. It’s not the work of someone who is indifferent. It is created in recognition of how easily one could be paralysed with despair. And the hint of light green leaves through the window might speak kindly to us, even today, when we’re overburdened with our own sense of the weight of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, there were more private traumas. Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. He was involved in a protracted and very painful legal dispute with his estranged wife. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/woman-in-blue-or-the-large-blue-robe-and-mimosas-1937.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4791" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/woman-in-blue-or-the-large-blue-robe-and-mimosas-1937.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="woman-in-blue-or-the-large-blue-robe-and-mimosas-1937" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Woman in Blue or the Large Blue Robe and Mimosas, 1937</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1942 when Paris had fallen, and the German 6th Army was pushing through Russia towards the southern oilfields, Matisse painted a number of pictures of dancers, with fabulous legs, reclining in big, soft armchairs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1004" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dancer-and-rocaille-armchair-on-a-black-background-1942.jpgLarge-1.jpg" alt="dancer-and-rocaille-armchair-on-a-black-background-1942.jpgLarge-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Dancer and Rocaille Armchair on a Black Background, 1942</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most poignant of his cheerful, hopeful works were produced at the very end of his life, around about 1950 when he was in his eighties. He had been an invalid for years; mostly bedridden, occasionally able to get around in a wheelchair. He knew he was facing death.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8130788144_044bebf3f2_o-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4792" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8130788144_044bebf3f2_o-1.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="8130788144_044bebf3f2_o-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tree of Life, 1948-51</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deep blue and yellow – and the simple pattern – of the stained glass seems to glow with delight in existence. But Matisse wasn’t expressing a cheerfulness he had recently experienced. The vulnerable, suffering great painter was attempting to ward off his own fears of gloom and despondency; he was reminding us through his genius that there is nothing quite as serious as knowing how to hope.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Edward Hopper is a painter of gloomy-looking paintings which don’t make us feel gloomy. Instead, they help us to recognise and accept the loneliness that so often lies at the heart of sadness.</p>
<p class="p1">In his <em>Automat</em>, a woman sits alone drinking a cup of coffee. It is late and, to judge by her hat and coat, cold outside. The room seems large, brightly lit and empty. The decor is functional, and the woman looks self-conscious and slightly afraid. Perhaps she’s unused to sitting alone in a public place. Something appears to have gone wrong. She invites the viewer to imagine stories about her – of betrayal or loss. She may be trying not to let her hand shake as she moves the coffee cup to her lips. It may be eleven at night in February in a large dark North American city.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5439" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperA.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="PM-130314-hopperA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Automat, </em>1927</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Automat</em> is a picture of sadness – and yet it is not a sad picture. There can be something enticing, even charming, about anonymous diners. The lack of domesticity, the bright lights and anonymous furniture offer a relief from what can be the false comforts of home. It may be easier to give way to sadness here than in a cosy living room with wallpaper and framed photos. Home often appears to have betrayed Hopper’s characters; something has happened there that forces them out into the night and onto the road. The twenty-four-hour diner, the train station waiting room or motel are sanctuaries for those who have, for sound reasons, failed to find a place in the ordinary world of relationships and community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5440" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperB.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="PM-130314-hopperB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>A place for a special kind of anonymity</em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1024px-Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5441" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1024px-Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942.jpg?resize=635%2C347" alt="1024px-Nighthawks_by_Edward_Hopper_1942" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Nighthawks</i>, 1942</p>
<p class="p1">Hopper&#8217;s ability to portray solitude grew from his own familiarity with it. He was born in 1882 in a shipbuilding town, Upper Nyack, New York, and had a comfortable, middle-class childhood as the son of merchant. Yet inside, Hopper often felt awkward, a bit like an outsider. An early self-portrait shows him gazing almost distrustfully at the viewer.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Self_portrait_by_edward_hopper.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5442" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Self_portrait_by_edward_hopper.jpg?resize=635%2C746" alt="Self_portrait_by_edward_hopper" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Self-Portrait, </i>1906</p>
<p class="p1">Hopper longed to be an artist, but his parents insisted he train in commercial art to stay afloat financially. He hated it, and to escape, he took several trips to Paris under the pretence of studying French art. But. in truth, he didn&#8217;t feel a connection to the art salons. He absorbed some of the Impressionists but forgot Picasso&#8217;s name. He preferred to be outdoors, watching the children playing in Luxembourg Gardens, listening to concerts in the Tuileries, and travelling up and down the Seine by boat.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/not_detected_235603.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5443" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/not_detected_235603.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="not_detected_235603.jpg!Large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Le Pont Royal, 1909</em></p>
<p class="p1">In 1913, when he was thirty-one, Hopper settled in Greenwich Village in New York City, where he remained for the rest of his life. There he discovered how crowded and yet isolated city life could be. The populations of American cities were skyrocketing, yet they were inhabited by passing strangers alienated from one another. Hopper would ride the L-train and look down at the &#8220;dark glimpses of office interiors that were so fleeting as to leave fresh and vivid impressions on my mind.&#8221; In each room, a separate drama was unfolding, an unnoticed, oblivious island in a sea of people.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/office-at-night.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5444" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/office-at-night.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="office-at-night" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Office at Night, 1940</em></p>
<p class="p1">Although Hopper painted in New York for over a decade, his works didn&#8217;t sell very well. He regularly struggled to find inspiration. Then, in his early forties, he met a beautiful, social painter named Josephine. Edward and Josephine took excursions to paint by the sea; they went to the movies and the theatre. Eventually, they married. Hopper was no longer so alone.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/summer-evening.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5445" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/summer-evening.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="summer-evening.jpg!Large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Summer Evening, 1947</em></p>
<p class="p1">But of course – as most of us discover in our relationships – Hopper&#8217;s marriage didn&#8217;t permanently end his feelings of isolation and woe. He was still lonely at times. He and his wife couldn&#8217;t quite figure out their sex life. She often seemed to prefer the company of her cat.</p>
<p class="p1">Hopper discovered that – even when others love us very much – some essential part of us is always alone.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hopper1959excursion-into-philosophy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5446" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hopper1959excursion-into-philosophy.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="Hopper, Excursion into Philosophy 1959" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Excursion into Philosophy</i>, 1959</p>
<p class="p1">It is this recognition that makes his paintings so compelling. And indeed, it is by addressing loneliness that art can be most therapeutic: consoling us and reassuring us that estrangement and sorrow are normal, that we are neither very strange nor very shameful for experiencing them. Sad and lonely art allows us as viewers to witness an echo of our own griefs and disappointments, and thereby to feel less personally persecuted and beset by them.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5447" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperC.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="PM-130314-hopperC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Western Motel, 1957</em></p>
<p class="p1">Hopper&#8217;s art helps us notice the landscape of loneliness in our own lives. A side effect of coming into contact with any great artist is that we start to notice things in the world that the painter would have been receptive to. Nowadays, we&#8217;ve become sensitised to what one might call the Hopperesque, a quality found not only in the North American places Hopper himself visited, but anywhere in the developed world where there are motels and service stations, roadside diners and airports, bus stations and all-night supermarkets.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5448" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperD.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="PM-130314-hopperD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em>There are so many motels like this one</em></p>
<p class="p1">Service stations readily evoke Hopper&#8217;s famous <em>Gas</em>, painted thirteen years afte<em>r Automat</em>. In this painting, we see a petrol station on its own in the impending darkness. The isolation is made poignant and enticing. The darkness that spreads like a fog from the right of the canvas contrasts with the security of the station. Against the backdrop of night and the wild woods, in this last outpost of humanity, a sense of kinship seems easier to develop than in city daylight.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5449" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperE.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="PM-130314-hopperE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Gas, </i>1940</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hopper loved the introspective mood that often comes with travelling. He liked painting the atmosphere inside half-empty train carriages making their way across a landscape, when we can stand outside our normal selves and look at our lives in a way we don’t in more settled circumstances. We have all known the atmosphere in Hopper’s <i>Compartment C, Car 293</i> – though we perhaps never recognise it as well as when Hopper holds a mirror up to it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperF11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5450" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-130314-hopperF11.jpg?resize=635%2C557" alt="PM-130314-hopperF1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Compartment C, Car 293 1938</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Hopper’s marriage, his professional life suddenly began to improve as well. It was the era of the Great Depression, and yet his paintings began to sell. Critics raved, museums bought his paintings and he won awards. But despite his success, he remained deeply introverted. Instead of escaping solitude, he embraced it. For decades he turned down awards, rejected speaking opportunities, and lived simply out of the public eye. He died in 1967, yet his art continues to help us see the loneliness in our own lives from a wiser and more mature perspective. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Oscar Wilde once remarked that there had been no fog in London before Whistler had painted it. There was of course lots of fog, it was just that little bit harder to notice its qualities without the example of Whistler to direct our gaze. What Wilde said of Whistler, we may well say of Hopper: that there were far fewer interesting, strangely haunting and consolingly beautiful service stations, train carriages, motels and diners visible in the world before Edward Hopper began to paint.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the most depressing aspects of travel is finding that the world often looks the same in many different places. The towers of downtown Tokyo are indistinguishable from those of Frankfurt or Seattle. That’s no coincidence. Modern architecture was founded on the idea that buildings should logically look the same everywhere. The early figures of Modernism were united in their bitter opposition to any kind of ‘regionalism’, which they saw as reactionary, folkloric and plain mediocre. If bicycles, telephones and planes (all harbingers of the new age) weren’t going to be done up in a local style, why should buildings? Down with chalets, wigwams and gargoyles.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer began his career as an orthodox modern architect, subscribing thoroughly to this universalist credo. He was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1907 – and developed a passion for architecture in his early teens. When he went to study at the National School of Fine Arts, he fell in with a group that venerated the great European Modernist architects, especially Le Corbusier – who had insisted with particular vehemence on making sure buildings made no concession whatever to the culture in which they were located.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niemeyer’s professional ambitions were realised when, in 1936, Le Corbusier was commissioned to come to Rio to design the new Ministry of Education and Health. Niemeyer was invited to join the team of Brazilian architects charged with helping the European to realise his scheme on this large and prestigious building.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philippou.2010.04.21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4804" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philippou.2010.04.21.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="philippou.2010.04.21" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While working with him, Niemeyer retained the utmost respect for Le Corbusier, but at the same time, he couldn’t help but observe how blind his guest was to the particularities of Brazilian culture and climate. With what would become his legendary charm, Niemeyer managed to persuade Le Corbusier to abandon some of his more hard-edged ‘universalist’ intentions for the building and to make some concessions to local conditions. Under his influence, the building’s windows acquired ‘louvres’ against the sun and, most spectacularly of all, Niemeyer persuaded Le Corbusier to commission an enormous traditional Portuguese piece of tile work, done up with abstract motifs, for the public areas on the ground floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gustavo_Capanema_Palace_Rio_de_Janeiro_Brazil_main_entrance_2004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4803" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Gustavo_Capanema_Palace_Rio_de_Janeiro_Brazil_main_entrance_2004.jpg?resize=635%2C349" alt="Gustavo_Capanema_Palace_Rio_de_Janeiro_Brazil_main_entrance_2004" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emboldened by his success with the building, Niemeyer felt ready to break free from European Modernism. He is to be celebrated for being perhaps the first architect anywhere in the world to practice a regional kind of Modernism: in his case, a Brazilian-infused modernism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His first wholly original work was completed in 1943 (when he was 36), and was commissioned by the local mayor of Belo Horizonte, the future president of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek. It was a building complex that included a casino, a restaurant, a dance hall, a yacht club and most famously, a place of worship, now known as the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, in Belo Horizonte. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the local clergy hated it (Archbishop Antonio dos Santos Cabral called it a “devil’s bomb shelter unfit for religious purposes”), it was quickly recognised as a masterpiece. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The complex had no straight lines on any plane, for Niemeyer now judged these to be European and (it was the heyday of Fascism) appallingly authoritarian. Architecture had in theory been liberated from oppressive structural conventions by the invention of reinforced concrete – and Niemeyer proposed that one should use the new freedom in more creative ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niemeyer was henceforth to include curves in all his buildings, and saw them in a nationalistic light as being particularly Brazilian in nature. “It is not the right angle that attracts me, nor the straight line, hard and inflexible, created by man,” he said. “What attracts me is the free and sensual curve—the curve that I find in the mountains of my country, in the sinuous course of its rivers and in the bodies of its beautiful women.” The latter point is telling. Niemeyer was deeply responsive to female beauty throughout his life. He was famous around Rio for his affairs, many with people dramatically younger than he was. At 92, he acquired a girlfriend who had just turned 25. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As in the Ministry of Health, the Pampulha Church had tiles across it. They reminded viewers that Brazil could be both modern and recall its heritage – that a church might nod towards the forms of a futuristic airplane hanger, and yet could at the same time accommodate a depiction of Saint Francis and some (distinctly charming) chickens. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3154" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/002.jpg" alt="002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sensuality that Niemeyer enjoyed in his life also came to infuse many of his buildings. His Casa das Canoas (1951) repositions sensuality as part of a sophisticated, mature life. Instead of suggesting that it might be the special province of the young, the carefree, the louche or the pretty, he creates a home where one imagines you can be an accountant or work in the Ministry of Infrastructure (be a responsible, hard working person much concerned with technical and administrative problems) and relish your body. You can have a conversation that stretches your mind and also be gently exploring the back of your lover’s knee; or you might kiss in the warm shadows before taking a conference call about worrying regional sales projections.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The house is a bit like a confident and encouraging friend who makes reassuring murmurs at the right time. One could imagine a couple feeling safe enough in this house to be sexually adventurous in a way that felt impossible for years in their normal home.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5696218302_befc49d6c0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8864" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5696218302_befc49d6c0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="5696218302_befc49d6c0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niemeyer’s most audacious attempt to use architecture to define Brazilian identity came with his designs for the new capital, Brasília. In 1956, Kubitschek asked Niemeyer to help create a wholly planned city in the centre of the country, free from the corruption of the old capital in Rio. Niemeyer drew up the National Congress, a cathedral, a cultural complex, many ministries and commercial and residential buildings. The atmosphere was dignified, hopeful, and in touch with the native environment. Apartment buildings were lifted on stilts to allow vegetation to grow beneath them, maintaining a connection with the local ecology and tropical climate. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3156" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/item16.rendition.slideshowVertical.the-architects-eye-lee-mindel-brasilia-brazil-16-national-congress-of-brazil-exterior.jpg" alt="item16.rendition.slideshowVertical.the-architects-eye-lee-mindel-brasilia-brazil-16-national-congress-of-brazil-exterior" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, Niemeyer’s works depicted Brazil not as it was, but as he believed and hoped it might one day be. He knew that architecture can point hopefully and encouragingly in a good direction. Brazil is a country of frenetic economic activity, of rainforest and Amazonian villages, favelas, soccer, beaches and intense disagreement about political priorities … none of which is apparent from contemplation of the National Congress in Brasilia. Instead the building imagines the Brazil of the future; it is a glass and reinforced concrete ideal for the country to develop towards. In the future, so the building argues, Brazil will be a place where rationality is powerful; where order and harmony reign; where elegance and serenity are normal. Calm, thoughtful people will labour carefully and think accurately about legislation; in offices in the towers, efficient secretaries will type up judicious briefing notes; the filing systems will be perfect – nothing will get lost, overlooked, neglected or mislaid; negotiations will take place in an atmosphere of impersonal wisdom. The country will be perfectly managed. The building, therefore, could be seen as an essay in flattery. It hints that these desirable qualities are already to some extent possessed by the country and by its governing class. Ideals flatter us – because we experience them not merely as intimations of a far distant future but also as descriptions of what we are like. We are used to thinking of flattery as bad – but in fact it is rather helpful, for flattery encourages us to live up to the appealing image it presents. The child who is praised for his or her first modest attempts at humour, and called witty as a result, is being guided and helped to develop beyond what he or she actually happens to be right now. They grow into the person they have flatteringly been described as already being. This is important because the obstacle to our good development is not usually arrogance, but a lack of confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3157" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/o-arquiteto-oscar-niemeyer-participou-de-ensaio-da-beija-flor-de-nilc3b3polis-no-sambc3b3dromo-do-rio.jpg" alt="o-arquiteto-oscar-niemeyer-participou-de-ensaio-da-beija-flor-de-nilc3b3polis-no-sambc3b3dromo-do-rio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Niemeyer enjoys the beautiful dream of a Brazilian carnival in 2012, the year of his death. His then girlfriend was 42.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niemeyer was prolific until his very last years, teaching around the world, writing and designing sculptures and furniture. He died in 2012, when he was 104 years old. He was given a hero’s funeral and thousands joined the cortege. What his nation was honouring was an architect who had given it a workable yet ideal portrait of itself. He had enabled Brazil to break free from a sterile European modernism – and to create buildings that better reflected the nation’s uniqueness. Niemeyer remains an example to all architects who aspire to put up buildings that remember the distinctiveness of their locales – architects who may like their phones to be universal in design, but are as keen for their buildings to be culturally specific.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Modern architecture produces truly innovative work: glittering, staggeringly tall buildings, opera houses that look like folded origami, even museums that look like spaceships. However, in turning towards everything new, architectural modernism also dogmatically left behind much of what makes buildings lovely. The best architects of the modern age have managed to avoid this pitfall, discarding older, dull conventions while retaining the meaningful and beautiful aspects of tradition. Perhaps one of the most successful architects at finding this balance was a whimsical, absent-minded American named Louis Kahn.</p>
<p class="p2">Kahn was born in 1901. As a young man he studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, but his career truly blossomed in the 1950s after a trip to Rome led him to a new appreciation of ancient designs. Kahn’s important contribution to modern architecture was to include these older and even ancient elements in his work without losing the innovation and clarity of modernism.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3277" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Salk_Institute2.jpg" alt="Salk_Institute2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, built in 1960</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One example of this successful rehabilitation of old ideas was Kahn’s affection for symmetry, which modern architects usually saw as unimaginative and conformist. Kahn designed the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California as a complex of buildings, identical on either side of a central fountain. Such symmetry was characteristic of the Beaux-Arts style, but Kahn was unperturbed by this apparent regression. “If people want to see Beaux-Arts it’s fine with me,” he said. “I’m [as] interested in good architecture as anybody else.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kahn used the identical rows of buildings to draw the viewer’s eye to the centre of his design, and to the sea beyond it. The fountain that runs through the centre of the institute aligns with the path of the sun on both the autumnal and vernal equinox. Thus Kahn used symmetry not as an aesthetic default but instead with great intentionality, to provide one with a sense of balance, focus, and momentum.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3278" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6865878740_c50d76765c_z.jpg" alt="6865878740_c50d76765c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Institute during the vernal equinox</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kahn also managed to create a sense of grandeur in his designs rarely seen in modern architecture. We might gape at the height of a skyscraper, but it rarely instils the sense of awe that a great cathedral does.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3280" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6312400890_1e0bc5768d_b.jpg" alt="6312400890_1e0bc5768d_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Yale Centre for British Art, built in New Haven, Connecticut in 1969</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet Kahn managed to reintroduce this sense of wonder and magnificence to modern works. In the Yale Centre for British Art, he draws the viewer’s eyes upward to the high windowed ceiling, much as though it were the dome of a church. The building’s wide column is imposing; even the staircases create a sense of lofty space and height. The effect is that the viewer feels reverence and appreciation not only for the art on display, but for buildings, museums and the idea of culture itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3281" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6312401250_6250880517_b.jpg" alt="6312401250_6250880517_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most modern architects have relied mainly on steel, concrete, and glass, but Kahn sought a wide variety of sensory materials. He regularly brought consultants into his office to find new uses for ceramic, copper, and other unusual substances, and once he had his class at Yale think of as many possible uses for clay as they could manage. Most of all, he rejected the idea that architects should always use the most efficient and modern building materials. Instead, he instructed his students to ask the materials for advice: “You say to a brick, ‘What do you want, brick?’ And brick says to you, ‘I like an arch.’ And you say to brick, ‘Look, I want one, too, but arches are expensive and I can use a concrete lintel.’ And then you say: ‘What do you think of that, brick?’ Brick says: ‘I like an arch.’” In short, the brick should have its way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tumblr_lxlkgr6G3k1qat99uo1_r1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4807" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tumblr_lxlkgr6G3k1qat99uo1_r1_1280.jpg?resize=635%2C389" alt="tumblr_lxlkgr6G3k1qat99uo1_r1_1280" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A striking combination of wood and concrete in the Phillips Exeter Academy Library, built in 1965 in Exeter, New Hampshire</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kahn especially liked to cleverly juxtapose unexpected materials like concrete and oak, as he did in his Esherick house, built in 1959. Usually, we associate oak wood with Victorian smoking rooms and dusty, ancient libraries, while concrete reminds us of impersonal factories and remote, futuristic buildings. But together, the two mediums demonstrate strikingly different, yet remarkably complementary virtues. The wood gives the space a warmth and domesticity that makes the house a good place for a bookworm, while the concrete provides a sense of strength and stability that lends it a reassuring feeling of refuge from the outside world. This combination of materials subtly suggests that we can find comfort and strength together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/louiskhan7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4808" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/louiskhan7.jpg?resize=635%2C396" alt="louiskhan7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Wooden shelves and warm beige concrete in The Esherick House in Philadelphia</span></h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3284" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kam_gallery2_0.jpg" alt="kam_gallery2_0" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, Kahn is remembered as a monumental architect—in both senses—during a time when most modern architects firmly rejected monuments as useless and sentimental. In 1938 the architectural critic Lewis Mumford firmly declared, “if it is a monument it is not modern; if it is modern it cannot be a monument.” But Kahn liked monuments. After his important trip to Rome, he wrote, “I finally realize that the architecture of Italy will remain as the inspirational source of the works of the future…those who don’t see it that way ought to look again. Our stuff looks tiny compared to it.” The marble Kahn used in his Kimbell Arts Museum, in Fort Worth, Texas is, for example, a clear reference to the ancient buildings that Kahn so admired.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3285" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1167px-Kimbell_Art_Museum_Highsmith.jpg" alt="1167px-Kimbell_Art_Museum_Highsmith" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Kimbell Arts Museum built in 1972</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Kahn died in 1974, he was perhaps the most famous architect in the United States, and he remained deeply influential. Kahn’s importance lay in his ability to transcend dogmatic modernism and return beautiful traditional elements of architecture to their rightful place in the canon of design, where they could continue to bring gravitas, elegance, and splendour to buildings for future generations. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The world of fashion can seem very silly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6590" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image032.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can come across as intensifying vanity and encouraging snobbery; it distributes prestige in unhelpful ways. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6591" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.jpg?resize=419%2C424" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This skittish, narcissistic side of fashion is unfortunate, for at its best, fashion circles round important territory. Clothes convey ideas about what is admirable or exciting, they influence mood and help define identity. Fashion is potentially a very serious part of life &#8211; but it has largely been abandoned to pretension, eccentricity and foolishness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person who did the most to realise the positive potential of fashion &#8211; and direct it to its true task &#8211; was the French designer Coco Chanel. She was born on 19 August 1883 in Saumur in the Loire valley. Her mother died when she was a child; she grew up poor and isolated. She was educated by charitable nuns. She was called Gabriel until her early twenties, when she was trying to make it as a cabaret performer and changed her name to the more distinctive ‘Coco’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She started out as a designer of hats, made a lot of influential friends and had several liaisons with British and Russian dukes &#8211; perhaps in compensation for her early very fragile social status. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image072.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6592" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image072.jpg?resize=511%2C519" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although we don’t often give the fact a great deal of attention, clothes are instruments of communication. We are very much open to being influenced by what a person wears. </span>Before Chanel, stylish clothes were complicated and very expensive. They were designed to stress the delicate, passive characteristics of their wearers.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image051.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6593" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image051.jpg?resize=518%2C490" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These garments put forward an image of delicacy and refinement. The wearer was presented as poetic, perhaps a little dreamy and sensitive. They looked like they wouldn’t have much of an appetite for dinner. This wasn’t meant to be an actual accurate portrait of any particular person. The clothes signalled an aspiration. The Victorian woman might be insecure, have a raucous laugh and be keen on eating meringues; yet the clothes provided an idealised portrait of the desired direction of travel: a picture of what this person would ideally like to be like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What Coco Chanel did was invent a new and better destination. In 1926 she introduced a very simple garment: the little black dress. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coco-Chanel.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6594" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Coco-Chanel.png?resize=635%2C560" alt="Coco-Chanel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It spoke of a different vision of existence: a different ideal. The dress spoke of being energetic and focused; the wearer would be sharp-witted, engaged in how the world works; they might have spent the day running a business or working at the finance ministry &#8211; or writing an experimental novel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was also making this ideal much more widely accessible. The dress was a fraction of the price of its more splendid rivals. It was designed to be long-lasting. Not just in sheer physical durability but in the psychological sense of not feeling dated. So the dress you bought in 1926 would do just as well in 1927 or 1937. In fact, it was intended to last for years and years &#8211; which radically changed the economics of being chic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.chhs.colostate.edu/News/Images/Large/4ha4rmsq11tuad2pmeousum5.Avenir%20Little%20Black%20Dress.jpg?resize=300%2C468" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another side of Coco’s proposal was to limit options. The dress only came in black &#8211; so you didn’t have to put your mind to considering and deciding. She was making the idea of being stylish simpler and easier. The little black dress was designed to make it easy and inexpensive to look elegant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The little black dress was conceived as the clothing equivalent of the Model-T Ford (which &#8211; not by chance &#8211; also came only in black). The Model-T had revolutionised the automobile industry by bringing cars, for the first time, within the budget of many more people. Instead of being a luxury for the few, personal transport began to become widespread &#8211; and, eventually, normal. Coco shared a similar noble ambition: to make her vision of elegance simple, timeless and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; widespread.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://complimentcloset.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/chanel-lbd.jpg" alt="" width="238" height="400" /></p>
<p class="p1">Most people see themselves as very individualistic. Because we&#8217;ve given up hope that the crowd could be impressive, toeing the line or just conforming to the convention are, understandably, viewed as negatives.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6595" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image021.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we might want re-evaluate the idea of looking like everyone else. There isn&#8217;t anything structurally wrong with the notion of a uniform, so long as the uniform is a good one. Chanel was searching &#8211; as Vogue put it in a perceptive article from 1926 &#8211; for ‘the uniform for the woman of taste’.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.theonlinerocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TS-SHOPPING-3-MCT.jpg?resize=444%2C592" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Finding a good uniform might be more important than emphasizing uniqueness.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The uniform of the Chanel dress &#8211; or something less costly inspired by it &#8211; stresses a range of admirable virtues:</span> the idea that you can be efficient, organised, serious and in control &#8211; without becoming puritanical or dour.  Such clothes stress the long-term, they hint that we should care about things which last, and not chop and change our enthusiasms at every turn. They argue that elegance is a key concern in a crowded and busy world: it means efficiency without loss of grace.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over her long and very successful career, many of Coco Chanel’s efforts were devoted to developing a distinctive brand. She didn’t just stick with clothes. She also designed jewellery and handbags. And &#8211; most importantly from a commercial point of view &#8211; her Chanel No.5 scent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Catholic Church had long used scents to promote religious devotion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6599" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08-1.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image08-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1">They had good uniforms as well.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They recognised that scents influence mood. The smell of burning incense could encourage the congregation to concentrate, to feel that something special was occurring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coco wanted her scent to summon up associations of a particular kind of person &#8211; confident, strong, attractive and independent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6600" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image111.jpg?resize=635%2C553" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A good identity, in a bottle.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim wasn’t simply to expand her business empire. It was to take a good experience from one part of life, where it might already be familiar, and apply it more widely. Coco loved beaches and bathing costumes, she liked the clothes people wore when playing sports. She wasn’t at all unusual in that. The kind of move she made always seems obvious in retrospect &#8211; but never was at the time. She took the pleasure of the beach very seriously and sought to extract the general, reusable essence from a local, particular kind of happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6601" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Coco: a desire to institutionalise certain feelings around summer, confidence and androgynous sailors&#8217; clothes .</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chanel was far from admirable in all respects. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6489" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg?resize=635%2C462" alt="640px-Coco_Chanel,_1920" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the second World War, when Paris was occupied by the Third Reich, she lived in the Ritz and spent a lot of time around senior Nazis. She was more than friendly and eventually worked as an agent, though exposure of her conduct did not occur until much later. Like many artists, her work was better than she was herself. She died in Paris, aged 87, in 1971. </span></p>
<p class="p2">In the Utopia, there would still be fashion, but it would differ from what we are currently most familiar with. It would take up Chanel’s attitude to classic style.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A classic isn’t just something that is famous or distinctive from a past era. It’s something that continues to be relevant and useful outside of the specific time it was first made. The true task of fashion isn’t to chop and change every year. Clothes are not emblems of vanity or clutter (as our fears sometimes suggest); they have a potential to be aids and prompts, friends, in our quest to become more mature, focused, sane and balanced versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, Chanel didn’t do all that could be done with her brand. But she&#8217;s inspiring in how she teased out some of what can be most serious about clothes. In the ideal world, a clothing company would &#8211; with the help of in-house philosophers &#8211; define what really matters most in life and then set out make clothes that constantly support and amplify these ethical and moral commitments. Nice clothes would be honoured for what they really are: embodiments of good ideas.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/91995962-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4810" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/91995962-1.jpg?resize=635%2C363" alt="Rising Sea Levels Due To Global Warming Threaten Low-Lying New York City" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is something compelling and exciting about cities that makes many of us love (and some of us dread) them. They are full of bright attractions, intriguing strangers and endless, unimaginable possibilities. Yet despite a great migration towards city living in the modern era, we haven’t quite got cities figured out. Some parts of them are full of delightful surprises, and others are dreadfully boring; or worse, dangerous. One of the most instrumental people in understanding how urban areas work was a woman who spent her life explaining just how complex and vital cities really are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Jacobs was born in 1916 in Scranton, Pennsylvania to a doctor and a nurse. As a young girl, she disliked school, which bored her, but liked telling her imaginary friend, Benjamin Franklin, about the world around her and why it was built the way it was. As she explained it, Franklin “was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details, such as why the alley we were walking through wasn’t paved, and who would pave it if it were paved.” This kind of thinking would later make her a great writer about practical ideas for a less imaginary audience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After graduating from high school and briefly working as an unpaid assistant at a newspaper, she moved with her sister to New York City during the height of the Great Depression. Looking for jobs, Jacobs liked to choose a different subway stop to get off at each day, and thus she discovered a new neighbourhood each time. One day she got off at the Christopher Street stop in Greenwich Village and fell in love with the tree-lined, winding streets. The sisters decided to move there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1056" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/155297218-1.jpg" alt="Greenwich Village" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In New York, Jacobs worked first as a secretary for a candy factory and later as a freelance writer and journalist for several magazines. She also took classes in various topics at the School of General Education at Columbia University, refusing to conform to any undergraduate curriculum. (Fortunately, she would always explain, her grades were too low for the undergraduate colleges to accept her, and so she was left alone to get an education.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the Second World War, Jacobs worked for the Office of War Information and then the Department of Defence’s magazine, <i>Amerika</i>. There she met her husband, Robert, an architect, and married him a month later. They would have three children. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the war, Jacobs switched to working for another magazine, <i>Architectural Forum</i>. She was assigned to write about a new housing development in Philadelphia designed by Edmund Bacon. Bacon, like many architects at the time, wanted to make American cities hubs of modernity, encircled with freeways that would bring thousands of automobiles and trucks through the city, and crowned with impressive, towering skyscrapers. Such projects were very well funded by the government and considered enormously important (Bacon himself would grace the covers of <i>Time </i>Magazine for his contributions). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1057" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1517530695_0514_Bacon_Biography_01_tcm20-1912468.jpg" alt="1517530695_0514_Bacon_Biography_01_tcm20-1912468" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bacon with models of some of his high-rises around 1960</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet when Jacobs went to see the developments in Philadelphia and interview Bacon, she decided she didn’t like his vision much at all. She found, for example, that the projects looked sleek and modern, but the streets around them were empty compared to older streets. People didn’t actually want to be around the housing projects, much less live in them. Jacobs decided that the problem with much of modern architecture, and particularly designs like Bacon’s, was that they bore no relation to what people actually needed. Instead, too many projects were simply the result of government funding and overzealous “reformers” who really sought to line their pockets or build giant, impressive, but ultimately useless, structures. Cities, in short, were being ruined by top-down planning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs surprised her editors with a negative story about the Philadelphia housing project. Nevertheless, her criticism was well received, and in 1956 she was invited to lecture at Harvard University. There she spoke about the foolish and even ridiculous plans for urban renewal underway in American cities, urging famous architects to “respect – in the deepest sense – strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order.” Later, she wrote a related piece, ‘Downtown is for People’, for <i>Fortune </i>magazine, emphasising the flaws of many redevelopment plans. “They will have all the attributes of a well-kept, dignified cemetery,” she warned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impressed by her work, The New School, a research institute in New York City, gave Jacobs a position, while the Rockefeller Foundation gave her a grant to write a critical study of urban planning in America, which would result in </span><span class="s2"><i>The Death And Life of Great American Cities</i></span><span class="s1"> (1961). The book was an extended criticism of modernist, rationalist planners and of one architect in particular, Robert Moses (1888-1981). Moses had worked his way up through elite connections to become one of the biggest urban planners of the New York City area, cleverly using money from toll roads to fund parks, pools, bridges and highways. His designs can still be seen throughout the city.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs wrote that Moses and his fellow designers were like children playing with blocks. They made large towers and then cried: “look what I made!”, not realising that what they had made was a social mess. In Jacob’s view, their urban planning theories about the necessity of open space were simply pseudoscience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Window_view.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4816" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Window_view.jpeg?resize=635%2C448" alt="640px-Window_view" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Patterson Houses in New York City, a housing development designed by Robert Moses</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why, then were such terrible projects built? Because they were the result of giant, theoretically efficient government projects that can be easily and simply financed. Such projects are top-down, or designed by a few elite people, speculating on the needs of those who will actually use them. Most of all, they lack charm and originality, which Jacobs believed was good for the soul. Of one building in San Francisco she wrote, “A look at this Buddhist Temple is better than a trip to the psychoanalyst.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finally, all this was a self-perpetuating social problem in Jacob’s view because the idea that certain areas with old buildings or crowded streets are slums had been absorbed by bankers, who then didn’t invest money in these areas for the minor restorations that might actually improve city life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6966479676_0949433294_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4811" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6966479676_0949433294_z.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="6966479676_0949433294_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs was upset that bankers wouldn’t lend to districts like Boston’s North End, which was clearly full of promise</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her book, Jacobs offered an alternative to the gigantic and unfriendly designs of architects like Moses. She wrote that the best way to see what a city needs is to look at the way people actually use it. “If you get out and walk,” she wrote, “you see all sorts of other clues. Why is the hub of downtown such a mixture of things? Why do office workers on New York’s handsome Park Avenue turn off to Lexington or Madison Avenue at the first corner they reach? Why is a good steak house usually in an old building? Why are short blocks apt to be busier than long ones?”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs suggested that what ultimately makes cities successful is their ‘diversity’, their varied resources and the closeness with which these very different people, businesses, and communities are knit together. Ultimately, Jacobs argued for a city that was meant for people, one that protected their social and economic needs, one that made them happy and comfortable, and one that brought out what people really like about cities. “In short,” she insisted on asking, “will the city be any fun?” A “fun” city, in Jacob’s view, needs all of the four “generators of diversity.” These can be rephrased as guidelines for city planning:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>1. Cities should be like ecosystems</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/170120382.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4812" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/170120382.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="Stockholm Prepares For The Wedding Of Princess Madeleine &amp; Christopher O'Neill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A glance at Stockholm reminds us of the many ways in which city dwellers are connected</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs described the ideal city as having “mixed primary uses,” meaning that it was both residential and commercial in any given area, and ideally that each block had activity throughout the day. This is because movement and involvement is what makes cities dynamic, desirable places to live. Cities are almost like the lunch hour of life on earth: they are where all the busy, frenzied, social exchanges take place and new relationships are formed. (And indeed, one of Jacob’s main arguments for why areas need multiple kinds of uses is that an area with, say, both office buildings and theatres supplies restaurants with both lunch and dinner business.) In order for cities to appropriately capitalise on their potential, different kinds of businesses and people need to be living in close proximity, so that exchanges can happen at all hours of the day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>2. City blocks should be small</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shorter blocks give people more opportunities to turn corners. This is good because it allows them more paths between one point and another, and more opportunities to discover new places and meet people. Shorter blocks also mean more ground-floor spaces for businesses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1065" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Maiden_Lane_SF_2.jpeg" alt="640px-Maiden_Lane_SF_2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs thought highly of San Francisco’s Maiden Lane for its short blocks and diverse shops and businesses</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>3. There should be a mix of old and new buildings </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because old buildings have already paid off the costs of construction, their rent is lower. This allows poorer people and companies to have places to live and work, rather than forcing them out as in a neighbourhood-wide renovation. A few newer buildings can then be permitted in order to draw in wealthier people and businesses. Jacobs believed that each neighbourhood should have both, preventing areas from simply being “rich” or “poor,” and encouraging people of very different backgrounds to live together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>4. Cities should be dense </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects like Moses and Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, who was better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965), argued for the benefits of wide open parks and boulevards. But Jacobs disagreed profoundly. In her view, streets should be places for people to encounter one another, to literally and metaphorically run into new things. Enormous plazas or business districts ruin this possibility. Jacobs insisted that in redesigning cities “the whole point is to make the streets more surprising, more compact, more variegated, and busier than before – not less so.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1066" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Union_square_san_francisco.jpg" alt="640px-Union_square_san_francisco" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs also loved San Francisco’s Union Square because it was designed to encourage continual activity</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moreover, Jacobs believed that density was part of how cities remained safe spaces. In dense neighbourhoods with relatively short buildings, she argued, everyone knows each other and they know what is and isn’t normal (this knowledge is a form of what she called “social capital”). As a result, the neighbourhood has what Jacobs termed “eyes on the street,” an innate communal awareness and safety mechanism. In a city with giant skyscrapers, Jacobs wrote, “nobody was going to have to be his brother’s keeper anymore.” Such urban designs would destroy the very nature of cities, their real lifeblood of sociability and interdependence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs was not the first person to have such ideas, but she was one of the people who expressed them most clearly and succinctly. She was an especially fierce opponent of urban development in her own area of New York City, Greenwich Village, during the 1950s and 1960s. Robert Moses and his plans had made their way there, hoping to tear down much of the neighbourhood and convert it to a new highway, the Lower Manhattan Expressway. The project included “slum clearance,” which meant the removal of hundreds of small business and family homes, all to be replaced with high rises. Jacob’s own home, which she had carefully renovated with her husband (even adding a small garden) was also slated for destruction. Consequently, Jacobs recruited a number of high profile figures like Margaret Mead and Eleanor Roosevelt to resist this change. With the support of the community and the media, Moses’s plans were eventually scrapped. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jane_Jacobs.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4813" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jane_Jacobs.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="Jane_Jacobs" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs holds up documentary evidence at a press conference about West Greenwich Village</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs, who had become a local hero, was arrested in April 1968, after being charged with inciting a riot at a public hearing about the project. Though she was largely exonerated of her charges, she moved shortly thereafter to Canada. Her decision to leave the US was based partly on her growing frustration contending with the City of New York, and partly to avoid her teenage sons being conscripted during the Vietnam War. Jacobs quickly assumed a similar role in Toronto, becoming a vociferous figure in blocking projects for an expressway (one of her common themes was to ask whether cities were built for people or cars), and campaigning for the regeneration of the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, which has been widely acclaimed as a great success in city planning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/janejacobsbike-credit-geniusofcommonsense-631x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4818" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/janejacobsbike-credit-geniusofcommonsense-631x10241.jpg?resize=631%2C533" alt="janejacobsbike-credit-geniusofcommonsense-631x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs, on her bike, fought against designing cities for cars </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jacobs was a woman of strong political convictions. During her lifetime she not only advocated for better urban planning, but also for equal pay for women and the right to unionise. She turned down honorary degrees from almost 30 institutions, always giving credit to the people working the protest lines instead. <i>Dark Age Ahead</i>, her final book, published shortly before she died in 2006, is a pessimistic treatise on the decline of North American civilisation, which she saw as endangered by excessive capitalism and too little emphasis on education and community. She was, in short, always working to defend modern life from ‘reforms’ that actually made life worse. Her work serves to remind us of the vital role that cities play in promoting economic innovation, and of the importance of urban design in fostering inclusive and adaptable communities.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Abstract art continues to provoke annoyance and confusion in equal measure. You know the kind of thing: a large empty white canvas, with a solitary deep black line down the middle. A splodge of purple paint against a yellow background. Ten steel beams arranged in a random pile. What does it mean? Is someone making fun of us? A child could have…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To adopt a more sympathetic approach (which can be useful and fair), we need to go back to first principles and ask: what’s so good about not showing what things look like? The central intention in abstract art is to get directly to emotion and to bypass representation. Like music, abstract art is best interpreted as echoing, or giving a form to, certain of our inner states or moods. Some might be relatively straightforward, like ‘calm’ or ‘anger’, and others will defy easy definition in language. It is therefore not very helpful to say: this painting doesn’t look like anything. It is true that it doesn’t look like anything in the outer world, but that’s because the intention is to represent the inner one. We should be asking: what does this work feel like? Does it evoke any of my emotional states? What piece of mankind’s inner landscape is being summoned? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The great abstract artist, Cy Twombly, was born in 1928 in the pretty, ultraconservative town of Lexington, Virginia. His father had been a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox &#8211;  in UK terms today the equivalent of being a premier league footballer. The artist was actually christened Edwin Parker Twombly but became known as ‘Cy’ in honour of one of the most prominent figures in the history of baseball, Cy Young. He went to Darlington School – a smart, expensive private school. Eventually he made his way to study art in New York in the early 1950s and then spent a year touring round the Mediterranean. The journey changed his life. He found himself an aristocratic girlfriend, moved to Rome and inaugurated his trademark abstract style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cy_twombly_rome_1962.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4820" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cy_twombly_rome_1962.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="cy_twombly_rome_1962" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly, Rome, 1962, Werner </span><span class="s2">Schloske</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He hadn’t left reason behind. He was deeply alive to the lessons of Roman and Renaissance art. What he wanted to do was give form to the inner states of humankind, just as the ancient masters had represented our outer ones.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TwomblyHorst.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4822" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/TwomblyHorst.jpg?resize=635%2C322" alt="Roman Classic Surprise: Cy Twombly" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy in Rome, with aristocratic girlfriend</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take his <i>Panorama</i> of 1955, now in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. We can’t see the marks precisely, but they fill the canvas, like mysterious script on a blackboard. We are held at the moment of being on the cusp of something. We are about to understand, but have not yet understood. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cy-twombly-panorama-1955.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4823" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/cy-twombly-panorama-1955.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="cy-twombly-panorama-1955" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly, Panorama, 1955</span></h5>
<p>Twombly’s work is like a specially designed mirror of a part of our inner lives, deliberately constructed to draw attention to it and to make it clearer and easier to identify. This work homes in on what it is like when you almost know what you think about something but not quite. It pictorialises a moment in reflective life, suggestive of ambition and confusion.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t surprise us in any way that Twombly loved figurative, representational art. His favourite artist was the 17th-century painter Poussin (who also lived in Rome). But he wanted to do something else in his own work:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/herolanderander_1984.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4825" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/herolanderander_1984.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="herolanderander_1984" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly, </span><span class="s2">Hero and Leander (To Christopher Marlowe) [Rome], 1985</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The title of this painting, <i>Hero and Leander</i>, makes reference to a tragic couple in Classical Greece. Leander used to swim three kilometres each night across the Hellespont to meet his lover (Lord Byron tried it too and now there’s a club). But Twombly hasn’t tried to show us the dripping torso or the treacherous moonlit waves, as Poussin would have done. Instead he has made a picture of what a certain feeling of love is like – the feeling, perhaps, of knowing that the person you love is making great efforts to get to you, or the sense that someone you love is desperately longing to make contact with you. It is a work of drama and passion, showing without representing. Gazing at the intricate, soft, swirling surface, one is drawn into a precious sense of the price of love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Twombly’s career was devoted to making portraits of inner life so that we might learn to communicate its fruits to other people. Getting others to share our experiences is notoriously difficult. Words can feel clumsy. This is more elegant:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/naples.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4826" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/naples.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="naples" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly, Naples, 1961</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might simply say to a close friend: ‘Inside, it feels a little like this.’ And they would understand. </span>Apart from abstraction, Twombly had a tendency to go in for some very simple looking bits of writing.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/goethe-in-italy-twombly.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4827" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/goethe-in-italy-twombly.jpg?resize=635%2C396" alt="goethe-in-italy-twombly" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly, Goethe in Italy, 1978</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a bit like a note to oneself – half-doodled on the back of a company report – a phrase, an idea, that’s come into one’s head, but doesn’t yet have a definite meaning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It looks like graffiti – something scrawled on a neighbour’s wall to give offence, to express anti-social aggression. But in Twombly’s hands, that urgency, the excitement and daring, the risk taking, the readiness to cause offence and upset people’s comfortable expectations – are being deployed in the name of wise cultivation, of true self-development of the enlargement and refinement of the spirit (all things for which ‘Goethe in Italy’ is shorthand). It’s a reminder of what we should think about, and pay attention to, far more than the slogans and brand names we are otherwise continually exposed to.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cy Twombly died in 2011 in his beloved Rome. He was 83 – and had lived to see his works gain immense prestige and appreciation among those whose opinions he respected. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His paintings are simultaneously about nothing – and about everything that is most powerful, private and hitherto incommunicable but important within us. He will last – as long as some of those great Romans he so deeply admired.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Andy Warhol was the most glamorous figure of 20th-century American art. He is famous for making prints of tins of Campbell&#8217;s soup and brightly-coloured portraits of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Michael Jackson. Much about his life was eccentric – he wore a silver wig; he liked to peel potatoes while lying in bed; he liked to go to the dry cleaners and stand in the corner, to enjoy the smells and sounds of the chemicals and cleaning machines. He loved airports, and used to go through airport security multiple times because he said he found it fascinating and inspiring.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Andy_Warhol_by_Jack_Mitchell.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7609" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Andy_Warhol_by_Jack_Mitchell.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="Andy_Warhol_by_Jack_Mitchell" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andy Warhol&#8217;s great achievement was to develop a generous and helpful view of two major forces in modern society: commerce and celebrity. He spent most of his life as an international celebrity, but he was also keen on business. Warhol was born in Pennsylvania in 1928 to Czechoslovakian parents and lived most of his life in New York. Today his name is one of the most commercially-successful artistic brands on the planet (his pictures of Elvis sell for 50 to 100 million dollars).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four big ideas behind Andy Warhol&#8217;s work, which can teach us a more inspired way of looking at the world, and prompts us to build a better society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Appreciating everyday life</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We spend much of our life working to reach some kind of better place: to have a nicer house, to buy better things, perhaps to move to a different country. We are often down on average things and positive about the exotic: a meal from Panama with Japanese infusions, a holiday in Tbilisi. It is normal to feel that the exciting things are not where we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andy Warhol aims to remedy this by getting us to look again at things in everyday life. The soup can is an intriguing object.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-sitotisk-na-papire-copyright-slovenska-narodni-galerie.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7608" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/andy-warhol-campbells-soup-sitotisk-na-papire-copyright-slovenska-narodni-galerie.jpg?resize=635%2C613" alt="andy-warhol-campbells-soup-sitotisk-na-papire-copyright-slovenska-narodni-galerie" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Putting them on the wall and looking at them helps us to see their beauty, to notice their appealing labels, their strong but elegant form, perfectly fitted to their job. When they are in a picture, we look at them with the same interest we might bestow on a candlestick holder or a spoon dug up from Roman times. Art can put us in the mindset of appreciation, which is hard to hold onto when we are busy using or consuming the objects around us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the same spirit of re-directing our attention, Andy Warhol made a video of himself eating a hamburger.</span></p>
<p class="p4">
<!-- iframe plugin v.2.9 wordpress.org/plugins/iframe/ -->
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ejr9KBQzQPM" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" class="iframe-class"></iframe></div>
</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He is trying to get us to practice a mental habit: feeling that the things we do in our daily life are interesting and worthy of note. Warhol wants us to realise that we are already living an appealing life – to stop being down on ourselves, and ignoring ordinary experiences – filling up a car with petrol, dropping something off at the dry cleaners, microwaving a pre-made meal&#8230; We don&#8217;t need to fantasise about other places. We just need to see that the things we do all the time and the objects around us have their own merits and are enchanting in their own ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Creating celebrities </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the 1960s, Warhol groomed a retinue of bohemian and countercultural eccentrics to whom he gave the title &#8216;Superstars&#8217;, including Nico, Joe Dallesando, Edie Sedgwick, Viva, Ultra Violet, Holly Woodlawn, Jackie Curtis, and Candy Darling. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warhol understood that celebrities have an important power: they can distribute glamour and prestige. He thought that glamour needed to be distributed in the right way for society to work well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, Warhol believed that the job of being a maid had too little status. He wrote: &#8216;They should have a college course now for maids and call it something glamorous, I think. People don&#8217;t want to work at something unless there&#8217;s a glamorous name tagged to it. The idea of America is theoretically so great because we&#8217;ve gotten rid of maids and janitors, but then, somebody still has to do it. I always think that even very intelligent people could get a lot out of being maids because they&#8217;d see so many interesting people and be working in the most beautiful houses. I mean, everybody does something for everybody else &#8211; your shoemaker does your shoes for you, and you do entertainment for him &#8211; it&#8217;s always an exchange, and if it weren&#8217;t for the stigma we give certain jobs, the exchange would always be equal. A mother is always doing things for her child, so what&#8217;s wrong with a person off the street doing things for you?&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warhol suggested that the President could use his status to shift perceptions. &#8216;If the President would go into a public bathroom in the Capitol, and have the TV cameras film him cleaning the toilets and saying “Why not? Somebody&#8217;s got to do it!” then that would do so much for the morale of the people who do the wonderful job of keeping the toilets clean.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warhol saw that celebrity culture has great potential. But he wants us to get the right celebrities. If we were to anoint some &#8216;Superstars&#8217; today we might choose, for example, a nurse, a janitor, an airport security manager, an engineer in a logistics warehouse, a philosophy student, an economist, or an 11-year-old who has just started drawing classes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Combining art and business</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He didn&#8217;t call his place in New York a <i>studio –</i> the prestigious term used by artists since the Renaissance to describe their place of work. Instead he called it &#8216;The Factory&#8217;.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/p357a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7610" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/p357a.jpg?resize=635%2C314" alt="p357a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Warhol in the Factory, 1965</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to feel that the idea of art and the idea of a factory don&#8217;t mix. But Warhol&#8217;s point was that business and art actually do very much belong together: &#8216;Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. During the hippie era people put down the idea of business – they&#8217;d say, “Money is bad,” and “Working is bad,” but making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.&#8217; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He began to like business when he made an agreement with a local theatre to make them one film per week. This moved his filmmaking from being something done on the side, to an organised production. He learnt more skills, and moved from short movies into longer movies and feature films (he also tried to learn the logistics of distributing movies, but decided he needed a partnership after all).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lesson of The Factory is that we can organise ourselves to produce good things more reliably and cheaply. One example of this for Warhol was Coke. He pointed out that wherever you go, Coke is always the same. Whether you&#8217;re the President or a cleaner, you still drink the same Coke – and it&#8217;s a good drink. Art has generally not been able to live up to this ideal of being good <i>and </i>widely distributed. Artists make a few things, and only a few people get to own them. Andy Warhol tried to counteract this. One day after reading that Picasso had made four thousand masterpieces in his lifetime, Warhol set out to make four thousand prints in one day. As it turned out, it took him a month to make five hundred. But he believed that art should be mass-produced and widely distributed. &#8216;If the one &#8216;master painting&#8217; is good, they&#8217;re all good&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vs-431.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7611" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/vs-431.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="vs-431" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p4">Andy Warhol with &#8216;The American Man (Portrait of Watson Powell)&#8217; at The Factory, 1964</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lesson we can draw from Warhol is that mass production needs to apply beyond making prints and other kinds of ‘high art’. We need the organising, commoditising and branding powers of business to reliably produce and distribute good clothing, high-quality childcare, psychotherapy, careers advice, and good architecture – to start the list.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Brand extension</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most art does not have an impact on the world. But Warhol was keen to do so. He mastered many genres – from drawing, painting and printing, to photography, audio recording, sculpture and theatre; he started a magazine, designed clothes, managed a band, made 60 films and had plans to start his own TV chat show. What held all this together was his approach to life, which came through in everything he did. He was sensitive: he noticed details, he was aware of how he felt, he was moved by the surfaces of the world. He was also kind: he was unbullying. He was not vindictive against the world. He was untroubled by people&#8217;s strangeness. This openness and lack of vindictiveness gave him freedom to play and enjoy the world.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ethel_Scull-1712x950.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7612" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Ethel_Scull-1712x950.jpg?resize=635%2C352" alt="Ethel_Scull-1712x950" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p4">Ethel Scull 36 Times</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All these values together make up his &#8216;brand&#8217;. &#8216;Brand extension&#8217; means taking the values which have been realised in one thing, and making them real in another thing. For example, if we looked at the values embodied in the VW Golf car – we might say that it is a car which is unaware of class distinctions, practical, elegant, affordable. These qualities are needed in many places elsewhere in the world. Brand extension might take VW from making cars, to designing clothes, or setting up a school.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Warhol was able to extend his work into different channels partly because of his populism. Being populist means he was unafraid to reach people where they started. The chat show is populist because it plays to what masses of people find funny or interesting. Warhol was populist out of generosity. He wanted to translate the things he cared about (sensitivity, love of glamour and spectacle, playfulness) into objects and experiences that touched many people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only pity is that he finished where he did. He could have founded his planned TV chat show, then gone on – in ever broader and broader partnerships – to start a fashion label, design a hotel, a chain of schools, a financial advisory service, a medical centre, a supermarket chain and an airport&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the task still open to people who are drawn to art, but also want to change the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He died in 1987 when he was only 58, after complications following routine gallbladder surgery in New York Hospital. He is buried at a small cemetery near where he was born, in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Dieter Rams is one of the world’s greatest designers of everyday objects. His mind, which might in other eras have been employed making sculptures for altarpieces or precision scales for diamond traders, is devoted to producing carefully-made calculators, shelving, office chairs, TVs, radios, watches, record players, egg-beaters, fruit juicers, video cameras, and electric shavers.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dieter-Rams.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7986" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Dieter-Rams.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="Dieter-Rams" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His career has been extraordinarily successful. The company he made famous, Braun, was &#8211; when he joined &#8211; a medium-sized manufacturer of radios in Germany and grew to become a global titan of consumer goods production. As head of design, Rams’s work ended up in hundreds of millions of homes. Apple took up his work with enthusiasm, finding inspiration in his T3 pocket radio for the first iPod.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/T3-and-iPod.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7987" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/T3-and-iPod.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="T3 and iPod" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is design important? Partly because poorly designed things slow us down and sadden us – the stapler that doesn’t work, the bag of walnuts that doesn’t open, the TV remote control that is impossible to figure out. All are symbols of miscommunication and lack of empathy. Bad design is also depressing given the price it exacts on the planet. Modern capitalism can seem to be stuck filling the world with junk, much of which ends up floating around the Pacific Ocean choking sea turtles and albatrosses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams shows us that capitalism need not produce </span>poor-quality products. His life and work are a guide to the values that we might make more central to our lives and our businesses. There are five underlying lessons to be taken from his work:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. The value of simplicity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams wanted to reduce everything back to just a few things that matter most. You can see this in one of his early products, the PC3SV radio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PC3SV-radio1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8007" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PC3SV-radio1.jpg?resize=635%2C313" alt="PC3SV radio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many more things which could be done with a radio: one could add in bass and tenor controls, separate AM and FM dials, an alarm clock, an output cord for larger speakers, and so on. Rams pushed in the opposite direction. He sacrificed things that were valuable, but not top-priority in order to achieve simplicity. He made the on-off switch a part of the volume control, which hadn’t been done before, and which people argued against. But the end result is satisfying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simplicity is so satisfying because our lives are cluttered, and the experience of having too many options is a constant drag on us. When we see simplicity, we know that we value it. But in many other contexts in our lives we find it difficult, even embarrassing, to be simple. If we get promoted to manager we might find ourselves feeling a bit awkward around still using a biro. Or we might feel the need to beef up a report a little, even though all we really wanted to say could be said in one paragraph.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our true selves might secretly yearn for something basic, but we might have lost touch with ourselves so much that it feels weird to seek it out. For example, in an expensive restaurant, there is a pressure to order something elaborate, even though deep down we might actually just feel like ordering cheese on toast.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/302.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7989" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/302.jpg?resize=635%2C350" alt="302" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being simple can make you feel vulnerable. But simplicity is really an achievement – it follows from hard-won clarity about what matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. The value of modesty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When designing a toothbrush, Rams spent weeks thinking about and experimenting with the ratio of the handle to the bristles, the width of the handle, the number of ridges for the thumb to grip onto. But this large amount of work is not obvious in the final product. This follows from a principle of modesty which Rams lives by, and which goes back to the Roman poet Horace: &#8220;the art lies in concealing the art.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Picture2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7990" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Picture2.png?resize=635%2C613" alt="Picture2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams had modesty as a person. Although he originally trained as an architect (and a carpenter), he wanted to make products that improved people’s lives, rather than design spectacular one-off buildings to promote his own glory. And the products he designed are also imbued with modesty: they don’t try to attract your attention for no reason. They are happy to sit in the background and do the work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/braun-sk-4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7991" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/braun-sk-4.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="braun-sk-4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KM3-mixer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7992" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/KM3-mixer.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="KM3 mixer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DesignMuseum-braun9.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7993" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/DesignMuseum-braun9.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="DesignMuseum-braun9" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">He spent 18 weeks agonising over the placement of the buttons</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modesty is the opposite of being showy. It is part of a broader ideal of service – which is a central ideal of good capitalism. One is not there to attract attention; one is there to help the customer to live a better life – like a discrete waiter. There can be few more quietly helpful tools out there than the 606 Universal Shelving System which Rams designed for the company Vitsoe, and which has been in continuous production since 1960.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/606-shelves.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7994" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/606-shelves.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="606 shelves" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The shelves stay in the background, modestly helping to maintain some order in the life of their owner</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">True modesty comes from confidence. Modesty is a lack of anxiety about being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Empathy with the customer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of Rams’s principles is that an object should be easy to live with, and easy to encounter for the first time. Rams was the first product designer to get rid of instruction manuals. The object should be obvious from the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/post0007_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7995" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/post0007_1.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="post0007_1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ability to create a welcoming experience for another person is a great skill. Not many people can do it well, however, because it derives from an unusual source. That is, Rams’s user-experience is guided by remembering what it is like to be distressed. He is in touch with what it is like to be lost – to feel abandoned, frustrated. Although his work looks serene, it comes from knowing how easily we get angry and muddled and ashamedly confused by instructions which any normal adult should be able to understand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rams.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7996" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/rams.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="rams" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are more like simpletons than we pretend to be. We actually want things to be easy and user-friendly. But we don’t readily tell other people that we are a bit stupid – although everyone is in many ways. Which is why it is the job of the designer (or the hotelier, or the customer feedback agent) to remember with tenderness the fact that we are all childlike and a little bit lost. Rams is like a parent: he is making the world friendlier for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Rams is not making things for actual 6-year-olds. Rather, he mixes insights about our childlike nature with a context of elegance and dignity. For example, this calculator with colour buttons to show you where the main functions are.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET-66-calculator.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7997" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ET-66-calculator.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="ET 66 calculator" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remembering that everyone is more easily confused than they pretend to be should be a basis for the reform of architecture, hotels, street design, websites, car manufacturing, phone companies, and writing books.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Being classic</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams was classic, which means he tapped into things that don’t change. This means we don’t have to buy new things all the time. A classic book, for instance, is La Rochefoucauld&#8217;s Maxims. It is a classic because the essential lessons in it are still useful for us to hear, many hundreds of years after it was written.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Overall, the global economy needs to be more classic. The fashion industry, to take what is currently the least classic business, could play more to our need to have items of clothing that are versatile and dignified in many contexts and less to our drive to set ourselves apart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have a Romantic ideology, which tends to emphasise what is new. Rams, in contrast, is interested in what is permanent. His goal was to create a product that wouldn’t go out of date, so we would never have to throw it away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SM2-shaver.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7998" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SM2-shaver.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="SM2 shaver" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Art and product design</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you cared about bringing more attention and care to the little things of everyday life in 1650, you might have gone into painting. The Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer was an advocate for paying more attention to the humble objects in daily life. In <i>The Little Street </i>(valued at £100 million) he portrays a life governed by simplicity and modesty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7999" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer notices the details: the lived-in neatness and order, the sturdy seats outside, the basic broom. Rams values the same things that Vermeer does, but he has turned these values into products we can use in our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/vitsoe-606-universal-shelving-system-living-room-003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8001" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/vitsoe-606-universal-shelving-system-living-room-003.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="vitsoe-606-universal-shelving-system-living-room-003" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no dividing line between art and product design. Paintings were originally meant to be part of daily life, to hang in your kitchen or the hallway, so they would seep into your life. Nowadays, we might only see Vermeer’s work once or twice every few years. Whereas Rams’s work we can buy and live with every day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/il_570xN.351138068.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8004" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/il_570xN.351138068.jpg?resize=635%2C580" alt="il_570xN.351138068" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/796px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Woman_Holding_a_Balance_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8003" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/796px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Woman_Holding_a_Balance_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C592" alt="796px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Woman_Holding_a_Balance_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer loved the precision of the scales. Rams loved this too, but his work reached many more people</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams raises product design to new heights. The true artist of our age designs phones and alarm clocks, rather than pieces of canvas. All the intensity, focus, high-standards, and the pursuit of integrity that is found in art can be brought into the realm of everyday design. And this is where it stands more chance of affecting people, as they check the time, or press the snooze button on their alarm.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BN2BKBKGB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8005" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BN2BKBKGB.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="BN2BKBKGB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rams shows us what good business could be: elegant, long-lasting, dignified. All capitalism should be like this. Ideally, entrepreneurs would study his work and devote themselves to the values of simplicity and modesty at the heart of his worldview. Rams’s mindset is currently unique, but it should become mainstream and widespread.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, artists made small, lovely things. They laboured to render a few square inches of canvas utterly perfect or to chisel a single bit of stone into its most expressive form.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Georg_Friedrich_Kersting_002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9152" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Georg_Friedrich_Kersting_002.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="Gustaf Friedrich Kersting: &quot;Caspar David Friedrich in seinem Atelier&quot;." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Caspar David Friedrich in his studio; making a small bit of the world lovely</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For several centuries, the most common size for art was between three and six feet across. And while artists were articulating their visions across such expanses, the large scale projects were given over wholesale to governments and private developers &#8211; who generally operated with much lower ambitions. Governments and the free market made big ugly things rather often. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/A145-00196_Aerial_view_north_east_of_Westway_Sports_Centre_A40_West_Cross_Route_industrial_buildings_residentia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9153" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/A145-00196_Aerial_view_north_east_of_Westway_Sports_Centre_A40_West_Cross_Route_industrial_buildings_residentia.jpg?resize=480%2C320" alt="A145-00196" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re so familiar with this divergence that we tend not to think about it at all. We regard this polarisation as if it was an inevitable fact of nature, rather than what it really is &#8211; a cultural failing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude_crop-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9179" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude_crop-1.jpg?resize=400%2C300" alt="Christo_and_Jeanne-Claude_crop (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Christo was born Christo Vladimirov Yavachev in northern Bulgaria in 1935, on the same day that Jeanne-Claude was born in Casablanca.</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is because of this failing that the artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude (collectively known as Christo) stand out as quite so important. Christo points the way to a new kind of art and a new kind of public life. Christo have been the artists most ambitious about challenging the idea that artists should work on a tiny easel &#8211; and keenest to produce work on a vast industrial scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other artists have experimented more widely and addressed us more intimately. What’s distinctive and important about Christo is that they want to make art that can fill the sort of expanses previously associated with airports, motorways, supermarkets, light industry zones, marshalling yards, factories and technology parks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo and Jeanne-Claude started exploring the effect of having an impact on quite big things, around 1968, when they draped a medieval Italian tower. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9155" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image10.jpg?resize=635%2C648" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Wrapped Medieval Tower, Spoleto, Italy, 1968</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was pushed much further when they wrapped a whole bit of coastline in Australia.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image12.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9156" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image12.png?resize=635%2C409" alt="image12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next they slung an enormous orange curtain across a valley in Colorado.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9157" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image01.png?resize=635%2C636" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then they got around to surrounding some islands off the coast of Florida with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 6.5 million square feet (603,870 square meters) of floating pink woven polypropylene fabric.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image03.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9158" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image03.png?resize=635%2C414" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Surrounded Islands, Biscayne Bay, Greater Miami, Florida, 1983</h5>
<p>They then wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9159" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image13.png?resize=635%2C637" alt="image13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in 1991, in a simultaneously project, installed thousands of umbrellas for forty miles along two valleys, one in the US and one in Japan.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9160" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>The Umbrellas, Japan-USA, 1991</h5>
<p><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9161" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image06.jpg?resize=635%2C368" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5>Wrapped Reichstag, 1995</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in 1995, they carried out a monumental project in Berlin. They veiled the German Reichstag, which was the traditional seat of national authority and also the focus on intensely painful memories because of its association with the rise of the Nazi party. And then they spectacularly </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">unwrapped</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it in an act of national renewal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo has gone far beyond even traditional architecture, the standard next step up from art: they occupy a space normally occupied by city planners or civil engineers constructing a container port or landscape architects laying out parkland around a town. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo can look very innovative, but in a way their conception of art is deeply traditional. What they mean by art is making beautiful things. They might be wrapping things or surrounding them, or marking routes with flags and banners, but what guides them is the search to make the world more beautiful. Only not just a little bit at a time. The scale of their efforts to make the world beautiful has been stupendous &#8211; and inspiring.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9162" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image05.png?resize=635%2C373" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5>Curtain Valley, 1972</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtain Valley, catching the sunlight, was visible for miles. </span>Millions of people wandered through the enchantingly remade Central Park.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image14.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9163" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image14.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="Passau Mural" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>The Gates, Central Park, New York City, 2005</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest thing Christo has done, however, is to indicate a direction of travel, which doesn’t stop with the great things they themselves happen to have done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One key move is not to stop with imagining something wonderful but to work out how to make the imagined thing come real. Rather than picture a revitalised central Park, they revitalised it. Rather than imagine Germany renewing its feelings about its historic centre of government, they made it happen. The ideal task of the artist isn’t just to dream of a better world, or complain about current failures (though both are honourable); rather it is to actually make the world finer and more elegant.</span></p>

<h5>One Million Square Feet, Little Bay, Sydney, Australia 1969</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary identity of Christo is an artist. But to operate realistically on a large scale, they needed to deploy many of the skills traditionally associated with business and which we think of as the domain of the entrepreneur.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image08.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9165" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image08.png?resize=635%2C425" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5> Heavy engineering: the Japanese umbrella project</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo had to negotiate with city councils and governments; they had to draw up business plans, arrange large scale finance, employ the talents and time of hundreds even thousands of people, coordinate vast efforts and deal with millions of users or visitors. And all the while, they held on to the high ambitions associated with being an artist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, crucially, Christo worked out how make a profit while doing all this. Profit wasn’t the primary goal. But profitability meant it was possible to go onto the next project (they have never received private or public subsidy). Christo has made a fortune out of what they have been doing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way they made money was fascinating: they financed a project by selling the plans and drawings for it. It was like Plato financing a new state by selling copies of the Republic (except, unlike Plato, Christo made their utopia happen).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image00.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9166" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image00.png?resize=635%2C574" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>The plan financed the real work</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo is a key exemplar of the crucial proposition that the creation of beauty isn’t a commercial luxury, but potentially a central plank of good commerce. They hint at a tremendous ideal: if making something beautiful could become a major way of increasing shareholder value, then the immense forces of investment could start to line up in the right direction. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo is showing us that ideally artists should absorb the best qualities of business. Rather than seeing such qualities as opposed to what they stand for artists, following Christo’s lead, should see these as great enabling capacities, which help them fulfil their beautifying mission to the world. In the future, an artist might spend as much time being trained by the Wharton School of Business or INSEAD as by the Royal College of Art. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christo has never got to build an airport or a supermarket or lay out a new city &#8211; but the ideal next version of them will. </span></p>
