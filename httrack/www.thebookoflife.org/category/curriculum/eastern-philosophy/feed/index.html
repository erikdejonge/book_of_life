				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The story of the Buddha’s life, like all of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted him to be the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace with every imaginable luxury: jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/34600-34603_hi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3508" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/34600-34603_hi.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="34600-34603_hi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Young Prince Siddhartha with his bride and servants</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected from even the smallest misfortunes of the outside word: &#8220;a white sunshade was held over me day and night to protect me from cold, heat, dust, dirt, and dew.” Then at the age of 30, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Determined to find the same enlightenment, Gautama left his sleeping wife and son and walked away from the palace for good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/05_lg-497x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4588" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/05_lg-497x10241.jpg?resize=497%2C450" alt="05_lg-497x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A Chinese painting from the Tang Dynasty shows Buddha discovering illness and old age</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gautama tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a small boy: sitting by the river he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. Seeing this, he’d felt compassion for the tiny insects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He ate, meditated under a fig tree, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: “nirvana,” which simply means “awakening”. He became the Buddha, “the awakened one”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tmp61_thumb_thumb11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4592" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tmp61_thumb_thumb11.jpg?resize=635%2C501" alt="tmp61_thumb_thumb1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A second-century carving of the Buddha receiving enlightenment under a fig tree, surrounded by admiring members of creation</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation (the Buddha called this “the middle way”). This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating compassion for others and seeking enlightenment. Next, the Buddha described a path to transcending suffering called “the four noble truths.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first noble truth is the realisation that first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction in the world: “Life is difficult and brief and bound up with suffering.” The second is that this suffering is caused by our desires, and thus &#8220;attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have a raise or a lover or enough followers but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting our mind we can grow to be content.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed “the eightfold path.” The eightfold path involves a series of aspects of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler impulses. Understanding is only part of becoming a better person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Seeking these correct modes of behaviour and awareness, the Buddha taught that people could transcend much of their negative individualism—their pride, their anxiety, and the desires that made them so unhappy—and in turn they would gain compassion for all other living beings who suffered as they did. With the correct behaviour and what we now term a mindful attitude, people can invert negative emotions and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into generosity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dharmacakra_Buddhist_Wheel_Sun_temple_Orissa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3511" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Dharmacakra_Buddhist_Wheel_Sun_temple_Orissa.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Dharmacakra_Buddhist_Wheel_Sun_temple_Orissa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art being invited to support philosophy: a beautifully carved eight-spoke wheel commonly used as a Buddhist symbol. The eight spokes represent the eightfold path</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Buddha travelled widely throughout northern India and southern Nepal, teaching meditation and ethical behaviour. He spoke very little about divinity or the afterlife. Instead, he regarded the state of living as the most sacred issue of all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the Buddha’s death, his followers collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside, meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main schools: Theravada Buddhism, which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. The two groups sometimes distrust each other’s scriptures and prefer their own, but they follow the same central principles passed down through over two millennia. Today, there are between a half and one and a half billion Buddhists following the Buddha’s teachings and seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2013-09-25-BodhiTreeMonks1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4590" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2013-09-25-BodhiTreeMonks1.jpg?resize=635%2C396" alt="2013-09-25-BodhiTreeMonks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern monks meditate under a fig tree near the place the Buddha first attained enlightenment</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of the important of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves from our own tyrannous desires, and recognise suffering as our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Little is truly known about the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu (sometimes also known as Laozi or Lao Tze), who is a guiding figure in Daoism (also translated as Taoism), a still popular spiritual practice. He is said to have been a record keeper in the court of the central Chinese Zhou Dynasty in the 6th century B.C., and an older contemporary of Confucius. This could be true, but he may also have been entirely mythical—much like Homer in Western culture. It is certainly very unlikely that (as some legends say) he was conceived when his mother saw a falling star, or was born an old man with very long earlobes – or lived 990 years.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/d41largest-584x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4594" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/d41largest-584x1024.jpg?resize=584%2C489" alt="d41largest-584x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Lao Tzu as a deity, carving from the 7th or 8th century</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lao Tzu is said to have tired of life in the Zhou court as it grew increasingly morally corrupt. So he left and rode on a water buffalo to the western border of the Chinese empire. Although he was dressed as a farmer, the border official recognised him and asked him to write down his wisdom. According to this legend, what Lao Tzu wrote became the sacred text called the<em> Tao Te Ching</em>. After writing this, Lao Tzu is said to have crossed the border and disappeared from history, perhaps to become a hermit. In reality, the<em> Tao Te Ching</em> is likely to be the compilation of the works of many authors over time. But stories about Lao Tzu and the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> have passed down through different Chinese philosophical schools for over two thousand years and have become wondrously embellished in the process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LaoTzu-Taoist-562x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4603" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LaoTzu-Taoist-562x10241.jpg?resize=482%2C470" alt="LaoTzu-Taoist-562x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Lao Tzu leaving the kingdom on his water buffalo</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today there are at least twenty million Daoists, and perhaps even half a billion, living around the world, especially in China and Taiwan. They practise meditation, chant scriptures, and worship a variety of gods and goddesses in temples run by priests. Daoists also make pilgrimages to five sacred mountains in eastern China in order to pray at the temples and absorb spiritual energy from these holy places, which are believed to be governed by immortals. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3292" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Mount_Tai.jpg" alt="640px-Mount_Tai" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">Daoist pilgrims visit a temple on Mount Tai, one of the five sacred mountains in Daoism</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daoism is deeply intertwined with other branches of thought like Confucianism and Buddhism. Confucius is often believed to be a student of Lao Tzu. Similarly, some believe that when Lao Tzu disappeared, he travelled to India and Nepal and either taught or became the Buddha. Confucianist practices to this day not only respect Lao Tzu as a great philosopher but also try to follow many of his teachings. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3294" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Huxisanxiaotu.jpg" alt="640px-Huxisanxiaotu" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A 12th-century Song Dynasty painting entitled ‘Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism are one’ is artistic evidence of the way these three philosophies were mixed over time, and often believed to be fully compatible.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a story about the three great Asian spiritual leaders (Lao Tzu, Confucius, and Buddha). All were meant to have tasted vinegar. Confucius found it sour, much like he found the world full of degenerate people, and Buddha found it bitter, much like he found the world to be full of suffering. But Lao Tzu found the world sweet. This is telling, because Lao Tzu’s philosophy tends to look at the apparent discord in the world and see an underlying harmony guided by something called the ‘Dao’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vinegar-tasters.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4596" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/vinegar-tasters.jpg?resize=635%2C589" alt="vinegar-tasters" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“The Vinegar Tasters”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tao Te Ching is somewhat like the Bible: it gives instructions (at times vague and generally open to multiple interpretations) on how to live a good life. It discusses the “Dao,” or the “way” of the world, which is also the path to virtue, happiness, and harmony. This “way” isn’t inherently confusing or difficult. Lao Tzu wrote, “the great Dao is very even, but people like to take by-ways.” In Lao Tzu’s view the problem with virtue isn’t that it is difficult or unnatural, but simply is that we resist the very simple path that might make us most content.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to follow the Dao, we need to go beyond simply reading and thinking about it. Instead we must learn wu wei (“flowing” or “effortless action”), a sort of purposeful acceptance of the way of the Dao and live in harmony with it. This might seem lofty and bizarre, but most of Lao Tzu’s suggestions are actually very simple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ad818f68-f5a7-4885-a815-ebd714ae72db.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4598" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ad818f68-f5a7-4885-a815-ebd714ae72db.jpeg?resize=635%2C454" alt="ad818f68-f5a7-4885-a815-ebd714ae72db" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An immortal (here walking on water) has certainly mastered wu wei, living in harmony with the Dao</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First, we ought to take more time for stillness. “To the mind that is still,” Lao Tzu said, “the whole universe surrenders.” We need to let go of our schedules, worries and complex thoughts for a while and simply experience the world. We spend so much time rushing from one place to the next in life, but Lao Tzu reminds us “nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished.” It is particularly important that we remember that certain things—grieving, growing wiser, developing a new relationship—only happen on their own schedule, like the changing of leaves in the fall or the blossoming of the bulbs we planted months ago.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chinesischer_Maler_des_11._Jahrhunderts_III_001-621x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4599" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Chinesischer_Maler_des_11._Jahrhunderts_III_001-621x1024.jpg?resize=621%2C527" alt="Chinesischer_Maler_des_11._Jahrhunderts_III_001-621x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An 11th-century Chinese painting depicts a scholar practising stillness by studying nature in a meadow</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we are still and patient we also need to be open. We need to be reminded to empty ourselves of frivolous thoughts so that we will observe what is really important. “The usefulness of a pot comes from its emptiness.” Lao Tzu said. “Empty yourself of everything, let your mind become still.” If we are too busy, too preoccupied with anxiety or ambition, we will miss a thousand moments of the human experience that are our natural inheritance. We need to be awake to the way light reflects off of ripples on a pond, the way other people look when they are laughing, the feeling of the wind playing with our hair. These experiences reconnect us to parts of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3298" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10003wl.jpg" alt="10003wl" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An open, decorated metal pot from the time of Lao Tzu</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is another key point of Lao Tzu’s writing: we need to be in touch with our real selves. We spend a great deal of time worrying about who we ought to become, but we should instead take time to be who we already are at heart. We might rediscover a generous impulse, or a playful side we had forgotten, or simply an old affection for long walks. Our ego is often in the way of our true self, which must be found by being receptive to the outside world rather than focusing on some critical, too-ambitious internal image. “When I let go of what I am,” Lao Tzu wrote, “I become what I might be.”</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hb_42.25.19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4600" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hb_42.25.19.jpg?resize=635%2C516" alt="hb_42.25.19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Deified Lao Tzu looks peaceful because he knows who he really is. A sculpture from between the 8th and 11th century</span></h5>
<p class="p1">What is the best book about philosophy one could look at? For Lao Tzu, it wasn’t a volume (or a scroll) but the book of nature. It is the natural world, in particular its rocks, water, stone, trees and clouds, that offers us constant, eloquent lessons in wisdom and calm – if only we remembered to pay attention a little more often.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Lao Tzu’s eyes, most of what is wrong with us stems from our failure to live ‘in accordance with nature’. Our envy, our rage, our manic ambition, our frustrated sense of entitlement, all of it stems from our failure to live as nature suggests we should. Of course, ‘nature’ has many moods and one can see in it almost anything one likes depending on one’s perspective. But when Lao Tzu refers to nature, he is thinking of some very particular aspects of the natural world; he focuses in on a range of attitudes he sees in it which, if we manifested them more regularly in our own lives, would help us find serenity and fulfilment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lao Tzu liked to compare different parts of nature to different virtues. He said, “The best people are like water, which benefits all things and does not compete with them. It stays in lowly places that others reject. This is why it is so similar to the Way (Dao).” Each part of nature can remind us of a quality we admire and should cultivate ourselves—the strength of the mountains, the resilience of trees, the cheerfulness of flowers.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Daoism advises us to look to trees as case studies in graceful endurance. They are constantly tormented by the elements, and yet because they are an ideal mixture of the supple and the resilient, they respond without some of our customary rigidity and defensiveness and therefore survive and thrive in ways we often don’t. Trees are an image of patience too, for they sit out long days and nights without complaint, adjusting themselves to the slow shift of the seasons – showing no ill-temper in a storm, no desire to wander from their spot for an impetuous journey; they are content to keep their many slender fingers deep in the clammy soil, metres from their central stems and far from the tallest leaves which hold the rain water in their palms.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Water is another favourite Daoist source of wisdom, for it is soft and seemingly gentle and yet, when it is given sufficient time, is powerful enough to mould and reshape stone. We might adopt some of its patient, quiet determination when dealing with certain family members or frustrating political situations in the workplace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daoist philosophy gave rise to a school of Chinese landscape painting still admired today for awakening us to the virtues of the natural world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At one level, it seems strange to claim that our characters might evolve in the company of a waterfall or a mountain, a pine tree or a celandine, objects which after all have no conscious concerns and so, it would seem, cannot either encourage nor censor behaviour. And yet an inanimate object may, to come to the lynchpin of Lao Tzu’s claim for the beneficial effects of nature, still work an influence on those around it. Natural scenes have the power to suggest certain values to us – mountains dignity, pines resolution, flowers kindness – and in unobtrusive ways, may therefore act as inspirations to virtue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that the contemplation of nature is a source of perspective and tranquility is well known in theory, but so easy to overlook because we take it for granted – and never give it the time and focus required.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1822" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LaoTzu.jpg?resize=523%2C392" alt="LaoTzu" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Lao Tzu in stone, near Quanzhou in China</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often our heads are filled with unhelpful phrases and ideas: things that have wormed their way into our imaginations and, by stirring up anxieties, make it harder for us to cope. For example, ‘Have the courage to live out your dreams,’ ‘Never compromise,’ ‘Fight until you win…’ These can (in certain cases) be a kind of poison, for which Lao Tzu’s words – combined with natural scenes – are the ideal antidote.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em>Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes.</em><br />
<em>Do not resist them.</em><br />
<em>That only causes sorrow.</em></p>
<p class="p1">The words of Lao Tzu set a mood. They are peaceful, reassuring and gentle. And this is a frame of mind we often find it difficult to hold onto, though it serves us well for many tasks in life: getting the children off to school, watching one’s hair go grey, accepting the greater talent of a rival, realising that one’s marriage will never be very easy…</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-1825" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_hampstead2.jpg?resize=517%2C484" alt="London, England, Britain - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><em>Be content with what you have.</em><br />
<em>Rejoice in the way things are.</em></p>
<p>It would be a mistake to take Lao Tzu’s sayings literally in all cases. To rejoice in the way everything happens (a mediocre first draft, a car crash, a wrongful imprisonment, a brutal stabbing…) would be foolish. But what he says is, on certain occasions, extremely helpful: when your child has a different view of life from you but one which is full of unexpected insight nevertheless; when you are not invited out but have a chance to stay home and examine your thoughts for a change; when your bicycle is perfectly nice – even though its not made of carbon fibre.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know that nature is good for our bodies. Lao Tzu’s contribution has been to remind us that it is also full of what deserves to be called philosophical wisdom; lessons that can make a particular impression on us because they reach us through our eyes and ears, rather than just our reason.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hb_1982.2.2-526x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4605" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hb_1982.2.2-526x10241.jpg?resize=635%2C506" alt="hb_1982.2.2-526x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">This 12th-century painting depicts a Daoist temple nestled in nature</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, there are issues that must be addressed by action, and there are times for ambition. Yet Lao Tzu’s work is important for Daoists and non-Daoists alike, especially in a modern world distracted by technology and focused on what seem to be constant, sudden, and severe changes. His words serve as a reminder of the importance of stillness, openness, and discovering buried yet central parts of ourselves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know very little for certain about the life of the Chinese philosopher Confucius (a westernised version of his name, which means &#8216;Master Kong&#8217;). He is said to have been born in 551 B.C. in China; he may have been a student of the Daoist master Lao Tzu. According to tradition, he began government service aged 32 and served many roles, including Minister of Crime under Duke Ding in the state of Lu. However, when Confucius was 56, he and the duke fell out over the duke’s excesses, and so Confucius left the court and wandered for 12 years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8482-004-7D9CC6B2-17.59.37.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4609" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8482-004-7D9CC6B2-17.59.37.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="8482-004-7D9CC6B2 17.59.37" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Confucius presented himself as a ‘transmitter who invented nothing’, because he believed he was teaching the natural path to good behaviour passed down from older, divine masters. Around the second century B.C., Confucius’s works were collected into the Analects (Lunyu), a collection of sayings written down by his followers. These are not always commandments, because Confucius didn’t like prescribing strict rules. Instead, he believed that if he simply lived virtuously, he would inspire others to do the same. For example, one of the short passages in the analects is:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stable burned down when Confucius was at court. On his return he said, &#8216;Has any man been hurt?&#8217; He did not ask about the horses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this simple three-sentence story, we are able to contemplate the implied value of human lives over objects or horses, and to wonder if we would have done the same.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Xiao_er_lun_-_Confucius_and_children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3517" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Xiao_er_lun_-_Confucius_and_children.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="640px-Xiao_er_lun_-_Confucius_and_children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An image of Confucius travelling in a wheelchair from a Confucian children’s book c. 1680</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the morals Confucius taught are easily recognisable – most notably his version of the ‘Golden Rule’: ‘Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself’. But some of them also sound very strange or old-fashioned to modern ears (especially to western ones). We need his advice all the more for this; it serves as an antidote to the troubles we currently face. Here are a few examples of what Confucius helps us remember:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ceremony is important</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The <em>Analects</em> are a long and seemingly disorganised book of short events, filled with strange conversations between Confucius and his disciples, like this one:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Tsze-kung wished to do away with the offering of a sheep connected with the inauguration of the first day of each month.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Master said, &#8216;Tsze, you love the sheep; I love the ceremony&#8217;. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first this is baffling, if not also humorous. But Confucius is reminding Tsze—and us—about the importance of ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the modern world we tend to shun ceremony and see this as a good thing—a sign of intimacy, or a lack of pretension. Many of us seek informality and would like nothing more than to be told ‘just make yourself at home!’ when visiting a friend. But Confucius insisted on the importance of rituals. The reason he loved ceremonies more than sheep is that he believed in the value of li: etiquette, tradition, and ritual. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This might seem very outdated and conservative at first glance. But in fact, many of us long for particular rituals—that meal mum cooked for us whenever we were sick, for example, or the yearly birthday outing, or our wedding vows. We understand that certain premeditated, deliberate, and precise gestures stir our emotions deeply. Rituals make our intentions clear, and they help us understand how to behave. Confucius taught that a person who combines compassion (&#8216;ren&#8217;) and rituals (&#8216;li&#8217;) correctly is a &#8216;superior man&#8217;, virtuous and morally powerful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/764866742.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4615" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/764866742.jpg?resize=635%2C531" alt="&quot;First Writing&quot; Enlightenment Ceremony Held For Children In Nanjing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A little girl at a ‘brush-opening’ ceremony at a Confucian temple, in celebration of the girl beginning her education</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">We should treat our parents with reverence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Confucius had very strict ideas about how we should behave towards our parents. He believed that we should obey them when we are young, care for them when they are old, mourn at length when they die and make sacrifices in their memory thereafter. ‘In serving his parents, a son may remonstrate with them, but gently’, he said. ‘When he sees that they do not incline to follow his advice, he shows an increased degree of reverence, but does not abandon his purpose; and should they punish him, he does not allow himself to murmur’. He even said that we should not travel far away while our parents are alive and should cover for their crimes. This attitude is known as <em>filial piety</em> (&#8216;xiào&#8217;).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AAM-IGS-17det-King-Jeongjo’s-Procession-NMK31.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3519" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AAM-IGS-17det-King-Jeongjo’s-Procession-NMK31.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="AAM-IGS-17det-King-Jeongjo’s-Procession-NMK31" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A detail from a 1795 eight-panel painting shows the Korean Confucian King Jeongjo’s yearly procession to his parents’ tomb</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sounds strange in the modern age, when many of us leave our parents’ homes as teenagers and rarely return to visit. We may even see them as strangers, arbitrarily thrust upon us by fate. After all, our parents are so out of touch, so pitifully human in their shortcomings, so difficult, so judgmental—and they have such bad taste in music! Yet Confucius recognised that in many ways moral life begins in the family. We cannot truly be caring, wise, grateful and conscientious unless we remember Mum’s birthday and meet Dad for lunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">We should be obedient to honourable people</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern society is very egalitarian. We believe that we’re born equal, each uniquely special, and should ultimately be able to say and do what we like. We reject many rigid, hierarchical roles. Yet Confucius told his followers, ‘Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, a father a father, and a son a son’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This might sound jarring, but it is in fact important to realise that there are people worth our deep veneration, even our simple and humble obedience. We need to be modest enough to recognise the people whose experience or accomplishments outweigh our own. We also should practice peaceably doing what these people need, ask, or command. Confucius explained, ‘The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that between the wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows across it.’ Bending gracefully is, in fact, not a sign of weakness but a gesture of humility and respect.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ft138nb10m_000091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4610" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ft138nb10m_000091.jpg?resize=635%2C553" alt="ft138nb10m_00009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A second-century A.D. depiction of Confucius showing respect to the his elder, Lao Tzu</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Cultivated knowledge can be more important than creativity </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern culture places a lot of emphasis on creativity – unique insights that come to us suddenly. But Confucius was adamant about the importance of the universal wisdom that comes from years of hard work and reflection. He listed the aforementioned compassion (&#8216;ren&#8217;) and ritual propriety (&#8216;li&#8217;) among three other virtues: justice (&#8216;yi&#8217;), knowledge (&#8216;zhi&#8217;) and integrity (&#8216;xin&#8217;). These were known as the ‘Five Constant Virtues’. While Confucius believed that people were inherently good, he also saw that virtues like these must be constantly cultivated just like plants in a garden. He told his followers, ‘At fifteen, I had my mind bent on learning. At thirty, I stood firm. At forty, I had no doubts. At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven. At sixty, my ear was an obedient organ for the reception of truth. At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired, without transgressing what was right.’ He spoke about moral character and wisdom as the work of a lifetime. (We can see now why he had such reverence for his elders!)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4pmblitg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3521" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4pmblitg.jpg?resize=635%2C408" alt="4pmblitg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Scholars in a garden–a painting from between the 7th and 10th century A.D.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, a burst of inspiration may well be what we need to start our business or redo our rough draft or even reinvent our life. But if we’re being very honest with ourselves, we’ll have to admit that we also need to devote more energy to slowly changing our habits. This, more than anything else, is what prevents us from becoming truly intelligent, accomplished, and wise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After travelling for many years, Confucius returned to his homeland at the age of 68 and devoted himself to teaching. He is said to have died in 479 B.C. at the age of 72–an auspicious and magical number. He died without reforming the duke and his officials. But after his death, his followers created schools and temples in his honour across East Asia, passing his teachings along for over 2,000 years. (They also kept his genealogy, and more than two million people alive today claim to be his direct descendants!) At first, Confucian scholars were persecuted in some areas during the Qin dynasty (3rd century B.C). But in the later Han dynasty (3rd century B.C. to 3rd century A.D.), Confucianism was made the official philosophy of the Chinese government and remained central to its bureaucracy for nearly two thousand years. For a time, his teachings were followed in conjunction with those of Lao Tzu and the Buddha, so that Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism were held as fully compatible spiritual practices. Perhaps most importantly, Confucius’s thought has been a huge influence on eastern political ideas about morality, obedience, and good leadership.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today millions of people still follow Confucius’s teachings as a spiritual or religious discipline, and even observe Confucian rituals in temples and at home. He is called by many superlatives, including ‘Laudably Declarable Lord Ni’, ‘Extremely Sage Departed Teacher’, and ‘Model Teacher for Ten Thousand Ages’. He is still a steadfast spiritual guide. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5805464375_9bd5909854_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3522" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/5805464375_9bd5909854_b.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Views of Nagasaki, Japan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A visitor at a Confucius shrine in Nagasaki, Japan</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might find Confucian virtues a bit strange or old-fashioned, but this is what ultimately makes them all the more important and compelling. We need them as a corrective to our own excesses. The modern world is almost surprisingly un-Confucian – informal, egalitarian, and full of innovation. So we are conversely at risk of becoming impulsive, irreverent, and thoughtless without a little advice from Confucius about good behaviour and sheep.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the West, philosophers write long non-fiction books, often using incomprehensible words and limit their involvement with the world to lectures and committee meetings. In the East, and especially in the Zen tradition, philosophers write poems, rake gravel, go on pilgrimages, practice archery, write aphorisms on scrolls, chant and, in the case of one of the very greatest Zen thinkers, Sen no Rikyū, involve themselves in teaching people how to drink tea in consoling and therapeutic ways.</p>
<p class="p2">Sen no Rikyū was born in 1522 in the wealthy seaport of Sakai, near present day Osaka. His father, Tanaka Yohyoue, was a warehouse owner who worked in the fish trade and wished his son to join him in business. But Rikyū turned away from commercial life and went in search of wisdom and self-understanding instead. He became fascinated by Zen Buddhism, apprenticed himself to a few Masters and took to a life of wandering the countryside, with few possessions. We remember him today because of the contributions he made to the reform and appreciation of the <em>chanoyu</em>, the Japanese tea ceremony.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7605155044_5f93f955ae_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8902" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7605155044_5f93f955ae_b.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="7605155044_5f93f955ae_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Japanese had been drinking tea since the 9th century, the practice having been imported from China by merchants and monks. The drink was considered healthy as well as calming and spiritual. But it was Rikyū’s achievement to put the tea ceremony on a more rigorous and profound philosophical footing. Thanks to his efforts, which were both practical and intellectual, drinking tea in highly ritualised and thoughtful ways, in particular buildings which he helped to design, became an integral part of Zen Buddhist practice; as central to this spiritual philosophy as poetry or meditation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Japan of his era had grown image-conscious and money-focused. Rikyū promoted an alternative set of values which he termed <em>wabi-sabi</em> — a compound word combining <em>wabi,</em> or simplicity, with<em> sabi,</em> an appreciation of the imperfect. Across fields ranging from architecture to interior design, philosophy to literature, Rikyū awakened in the Japanese a taste for the pared down and the authentic, for the undecorated and the humble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3623570429_cf1f192f56_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3623570429_cf1f192f56_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="3623570429_cf1f192f56_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His particular focus was the tea ceremony, which Rikyū believed to hold a superlative potential to promote<em> wabi-sabi</em>. He made a number of changes to the rituals and aesthetics of the ceremony. He began by revolutionising the space in which the tea ceremony was held. It had grown common for wealthy people to build extremely elaborate teahouses in prominent public places, where they served as venues for worldly gatherings and displays of status. Rikyū now argued that the teahouse should be shrunk to a mere two metres square, that it should be tucked away in secluded gardens and that its door should be made deliberately a little too small, so that all who came into it, even the mightiest, would have to bow and feel equal to others. The idea was to create a barrier between the teahouse and the world outside. The very path to the teahouse was to pass around trees and stones, to create a meander that would help break ties with the ordinary realm. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Properly performed, a tea ceremony was meant to promote what Rikyū termed “wa” or harmony, which would emerge as participants rediscovered their connections to nature: in their garden hut, smelling of unvarnished wood, moss and tea leaves, they would be able to feel the wind and hear birds outside – and feel at one with the non-human sphere. Then might come an emotion known as “kei” or ‘sympathy’, the fruit of sitting in a confined space with others, and being able to converse with them free of the pressures and artifice of the social world. A successful ceremony was to leave its participants with a feeling of “jaku” or ‘tranquillity’, one of the most central concepts in Rikyū’s gentle, calming philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yn75i001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4624" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/yn75i001.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="yn75i00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Tai-an tearoom in Kyoto, designed by Rikyū</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rikyū’s prescriptions for the ceremony extended to the instruments employed. He argued that tea ceremonies shouldn’t henceforth rely on expensive or conventionally beautiful cups or teapots. He liked worn bamboo tea scoops that made a virtue of their age. Because in Zen philosophy, everything is impermanent, imperfect and incomplete, objects which are themselves marked by time and haphazard marks can, suggested Rikyū, embody a distinct wisdom and promote it in their users. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was one of Rikyū’s achievements to take an act which in the West is one of the most routine and unremarkable activities and imbue it with a solemnity and depth of meaning akin to a Catholic Mass. Every aspect of the tea ceremony, from the patient boiling of the water to the measuring out of green tea powder, was coherently related to Zen’s philosophical tenets about the importance of humility, the need to sympathise with and respect nature and the sense of the importance of the transient nature of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s open ended where this approach to everyday life might go. It leaves open the possibility that many actions and daily habits might, with sufficient creative imagination, become similarly elevated, important and rewarding in our lives. The point isn’t so much that we should take part in tea ceremonies, rather that we should make aspects of our everyday spiritual lives more tangible by allying certain materials and sensuous rituals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rikyū reminds us that there is a latent sympathy between big ideas about life and the little everyday things, such as certain drinks, cups, implements and smells. These are not cut off from the big themes; they can make those themes more alive for us. It is the task of philosophy not just to formulate ideas, but also to work out mechanisms by which they may stick more firmly and viscerally in our minds.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the West, we have a vague sense that poetry is good for our ‘souls’, making us sensitive and wiser. Yet we don’t always know how this should work. Poetry has a hard time finding its way into our lives in any practical sense. In the East, however, some poets—like the 17th-century Buddhist monk and poet Matsuo Bashō—knew precisely what effect their poetry was meant to produce: it was a medium designed to guide us to wisdom and calm, as these terms are defined in Zen Buddhist philosophy.</p>
<p class="p2">Matsuo Bashō was born in 1644 in Uego, in the Iga province of Japan. As a child he became a servant of the nobleman Tōdō Yoshitada, who taught him to compose poems in the ‘haiku’ style. Traditionally, haikus contain three parts, two images and a concluding line which helps to juxtapose them. The best known haiku in Japanese literature is called ‘Old Pond’, by Bashō himself:</p>
<p>Old pond . . .<br />
A frog leaps in<br />
Water’s sound</p>
<p>It is all (deceptively) simple – and, when one is in the right, generous frame of mind, very beautiful.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After Yoshitada died in 1666, Bashō left home and wandered for many years before moving to the city of Edo, where he became famous and widely published. However, Bashō grew melancholy and often shunned company, and so until his death in 1694 he alternated between travelling widely on foot and living in a small hut on the outskirts of the city.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/basho.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4636" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/basho.jpg?resize=635%2C369" alt="basho" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō under the banana tree after which he is named, and which stood by his small hut</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō was an exceptional poet, but he did not believe in the modern idea of “art for art’s sake.” Instead, he hoped that his poetry would bring his readers into special mental states valued by Zen. His poetry reflects two of the most important Zen ideals: <em>wabi</em> and <em>sabi</em>. Wabi, for Bashō, meant satisfaction with simplicity and austerity, while sabi refers to a contented solitude. (These are the same mindsets sought in the well-known Zen tea ceremony defined by Rikyu). It was nature, more than anything else, that was thought to foster <em>wabi</em> and <em>sabi</em>, and it is therefore unsurprisingly one of Bashō’s most frequent topics. Take this spring scene, which appears to ask so little of the world, and is attuned to an appreciation of the everyday:</span></p>
<p>First cherry<br />
budding<br />
by peach blossoms</p>
<p>Bashō’s poetry is of an almost shocking simplicity at the level of theme. There are no analyses of politics or love triangles or family dramas. The point is to remind readers that what really matters is to be able to be content with our own company, to appreciate the moment we are in and to be attuned to the very simplest things life has to offer: the changing of the seasons, the sound of our neighbours laughing across the street, the little surprises we encounter when we travel. Take this gem:</p>
<p>Violets—<br />
how precious on<br />
a mountain path</p>
<p>Bashō also used natural scenes to remind his readers that flowers, weather, and other natural elements are—like our own lives—ever-changing and fleeting. Time and the changing of weathers and scenes need to be attended to, as harbingers of our own deaths:</p>
<p>Yellow rose petals<br />
thunder—<br />
a waterfall</p>
<p>This transience of life may sometimes be heartbreaking, but it is also what makes every moment valuable.</p>
<p class="p2">Bashō liked to paint as well as write, and many of his works still exist, usually with the related haikus written alongside them. This one depicts the above haiku. (“Yellow rose petals…”)</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3220" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Basho_Horohoroto.jpg" alt="Basho_Horohoroto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In literature, Bashō valued “karumi,” or “lightness”. He wanted it to seem as if children had written it. He abhorred pretension and elaboration. As he told his disciples, “in my view a good poem is one in which the form of the verse, and the joining of its two parts, seem light as a shallow river flowing over its sandy bed.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ultimate goal of this “lightness” was to allow readers to escape the burdens of the self —one’s petty peculiarities and circumstances—in order to experience unity with the world beyond. Bashō believed that poetry could, at its best, allow one to feel a brief sensation of merging with the natural world. One may become – through language – the rock, the water, the stars, leading one to an enlightened frame of mind known as <em>muga</em>, or a loss-of-awareness-of-oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3221" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jd_big.jpg" alt="jd_big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“Hibiscus with Haiku” by Bashō</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can see Bashō’s concept of <em>muga</em> or self-forgetting at work in the way he invites us almost to inhabit his subjects, even if they are some rather un-poetic dead fish:</span></p>
<p>Fish shop<br />
how cold the lips<br />
of salted bream</p>
<p>In a world full of social media profiles and crafted resumes, it might seem odd to want to escape our individuality—after all, we carefully groom ourselves to stand out from the rest of the world. Bashō reminds us that <em>muga</em> or self-forgetting is valuable because it allows us to break free from the incessant thrum of desire and incompleteness which otherwise haunts all human lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō suffered for long periods from deep melancholy; he travelled the dangerous back roads of the Japanese countryside with little more than writing supplies, and he spent some truly unglamorous nights:</span></p>
<p>Fleas and lice biting;<br />
awake all night<br />
a horse pissing close to my ear</p>
<p>Yet <em>muga</em> freed Bashō—and it can also free us—from the tyranny of glum moments of individual circumstance. His poetry constantly invites us to appreciate what we have, and to see how infinitesimal and unimportant our personal difficulties are in the vast scheme of the universe.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3222" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BashoRidingSugiyamaSanpu.jpg" alt="BashoRidingSugiyamaSanpu" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“Bashō riding a horse” by his follower Sugiyama Sanpu</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō’s poetry was a clever tool for enlightenment and revelation – through the artfully simple arrangement of words. The poems are valuable not because they are beautiful (though they are this too) but because they can serve as a catalyst for some of the most important states of the soul. They remind both the writer and the reader that contentment relies on knowing how to derive pleasure from simplicity, and how to escape (even if only for a while) the tyranny of being ourselves.</span></p>
