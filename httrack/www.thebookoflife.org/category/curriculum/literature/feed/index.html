				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">People have always had trouble pronouncing his name. The 19th-century British Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, was once mocked in Parliament for getting it wrong. If you don’t speak German, it’s not at all obvious how you are supposed to say it. A safe bet is to start with a hard g on ‘Ger…’ and end with a ‘ter’: Ger-ter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 &#8211; 1832) has often been seen as one of Europe’s big cultural heroes &#8211; comparable to the likes of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer. He excelled in a wide range of areas: he wrote many poems, was a huge hit as a novelist and made scientific contributions in physiology, geology, botany and optics. He was also a diplomat, fashion guru, a senior civil servant, a pornographer, the head of a university, a fine artist, an adventurous traveller, the director of a theatre company and the head of a mining company. No wonder another polymath, Andy Warhol, appropriated him for his pantheon of heroes:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During his life, Goethe’s admirers were impressed by his literary works. But more than any of his books, what impressed people at the time was how he lived his life, the kind of person he was. The life was more significant than the books (which helps explain why, unlike Jane Austen or Marcel Proust, his literary works are relatively unknown). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe was born in the city of Frankfurt in 1749. </span>His family was comfortably off – it was new money, made from inn keeping.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe’s parents took great care with his education: he was mainly educated at home; he wrote poetry for his friends, took art classes, learned Italian. He went to the theatre a lot and became friends with actresses. As a member of the upper class, he wore a sword in public from the age of twelve.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe, Self-Portrait, aged about 15</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He studied at the University of Leipzig and later did a master’s degree in Law at the University of Strasbourg.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image032.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7892" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image032.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He often skipped lectures and went to a viewing platform high up on a nearby cathedral tower. He was afraid of heights. But he made himself do it because he liked to overcome obstacles &#8211; and loved the view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can pick up some vital lessons from Goethe:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: From Romanticism to Classicism in Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe’s first proper job, after law school, was as an assistant at a national tribunal judging cases between the many minor German states that, at that time, made up the Holy Roman Empire. While he was working, he fell in love with the fiancée of one his colleagues. He then committed a huge indiscretion and wrote up the love affair as a novel. He called it <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> &#8211; the central character, Werther, is a lightly disguised self-portrait. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It tells the story of how Werther/Goethe falls in love with a young woman, Charlotte. It’s a very detailed description of all the tiny steps one takes on the road to infatuation: they dance together, at one point their feet accidentally touch under the table; they smile, they write each other flirtatious little notes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It makes being in love seem like the most important experience in life. Werther asks himself: &#8220;What is a life without romantic love? A magic lantern without a lamp.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This deeply charming novel was a bestseller across Europe for the next 25 years. Napoleon boasted he had read it seven times. The story has a miserable ending. Charlotte doesn’t really love Werther and finally rejects him. In despair he kills himself. The tragic dénouement shows Goethe beginning to see the limitations of the romantic view of life. Romantic love is deeply attractive but it causes immense problems too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The core problem &#8211; as Goethe sees it &#8211; is this: Romantic love hopes to ‘freeze’ a beautiful moment. It’s a summer’s evening, after dinner, Werther is walking in the woods with his beloved. He wants it to be always like this: so he feel they should get married, have a house together, have children. Though, in reality, marriage will be nothing at all like the lovely June night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>There’ll be exhaustion, bills to pay, squabbles and a sense of confinement. By comparison with the extreme hopes of Romanticism, real love is always necessarily a terrible disappointment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why Goethe gradually moved away from Romanticism towards an ideology of love he termed Classicism &#8211; marked by a degree of pessimism, an acceptance of the troubles that afflict all couples over time, and of the need to abandon some of the heady hopes of the early days for the sake of tranquillity and administrative competence. Goethe was a critic of Romantic ideology not because he was cold hearted or lacking in imagination but because he so deeply and intimately understood its attractions &#8211; and therefore its dangers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7893" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO1.jpg?resize=635%2C596" alt="20070418klplylliu_133_Ies_LCO1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe’s career shows us a journey away from the initial Romanticism of Werther towards a mature, classical view of life. His later play,<em> Iphigenia,</em> fully develops the Classical alternative to Romanticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Iphigenia is a Greek princess at the time of the Trojan wars, the daughter of the chief king of the Greeks, Agamemnon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>She and her family are caught up in a horrific sequence of murders and feuds: a dramatic exaggeration of the traumas of ordinary family life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Iphigenia_at_Aulis-David.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7894" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Iphigenia_at_Aulis-David.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Iphigenia_at_Aulis-David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Iphigenia, in white &#8211; with her difficult parents: Clytemnestra and Agamemnon </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically, the cycle of intense passion continues itself from one generation to the next. Goethe imagines Iphigenia as the person who finally brings forgiveness and peace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/800px-Goethe_Iphigenia_in_Tauris_1803.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7895" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/800px-Goethe_Iphigenia_in_Tauris_1803.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="800px-Goethe_Iphigenia_in_Tauris_1803" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Iphigenia persuades her brother to forgive their parents</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Iphigenia sees her role in life as that of &#8220;making men mild.&#8221; She is always encouraging people to calm down and be merciful. She is committed to love, but a love marked not by wild passion, but by understanding, sympathy and a desire for harmony: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Remembering that we all must die</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Should move the hardest heart to tenderness; </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Are we not required to show others </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The best kindness we ourselves have known? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe first audiences, brought up on Romanticism, were slow to get the message. Was Goethe turning his back on Romantic love? Where was all the passion? They described the story of Iphigenia as like &#8220;watching grey mist.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe, now in middle-age, was undaunted. He’d had enough of Werther and expressed his own view emphatically &#8211; &#8220;Romanticism is sickness, Classicism is health.&#8221; But he encountered an elemental cultural problem: Romanticism feels more exciting. Goethe pinpointed one of the central problems of culture: how to make things that are good for us compete successfully for attention with the thrilling passionate stuff?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: The Dignity of Administration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In April, 1775, not long after his big success with Werther, Goethe took a job as a civil servant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Carl August, the Duke of Weimar, appointed him as his chief adviser and senior administrator to help run his country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Carl_August_sitzend.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7896" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Carl_August_sitzend.jpg?resize=400%2C512" alt="Carl_August_sitzend" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Carl August, Goethe’s employer &#8211; for most of his life</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe continued in this employment for most of the rest of his life; his main jobs were as minister for roads &#8211; which was vital to trying to improve trade. He was the overseer of the state owned silver-mining operation. He undertook diplomatic missions and made major decisions around education and urban planning. He spent a lot of time in the twice-weekly cabinet meetings (which involved a lot of writing and reading of briefing papers). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can sound like a strange move for a very successful creative figure: as if the winner of the Booker prize became a civil servant at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. We just assume that art and literature are at odds with an enthusiasm for government administration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7897" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image11.jpg?resize=635%2C503" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe’s colleagues</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Goethe didn’t see it that way. Over the years, he spent a lot of his time drawing up reports and sitting in meetings about the pros and cons of purchasing specialist drainage equipment, the best material for resurfacing a highway and how to deal with with their overbearing neighbour, Prussia. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He felt that he needed responsibility, power and experience to become a more mature and wiser person &#8211; and a better poet and philosopher. But it did something else as well: it enabled him to put ideas in practice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image26.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7899" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image26.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="image26" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe expanded from being a solitary writer of plays to being head of Germany’s leading cultural institution at that time &#8211; the Weimar State theatre</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, he held the position of arts minister. He was able to establish the best theatre in Germany &#8211; and put on the first performances of many of the plays of the era. In modern terms, it was like setting up as a major film producer. The encounter with power, responsibility, budgets and money &#8211; with the mechanisms by which the world is run &#8211; enabled Goethe to purse a crucial developmental path. He moved from being a solitary creative thinker working essentially on his own to someone able to put his ideas into action. Instead of writing about how good it would be to have a national theatre, he was able to establish one; instead of just saying that cities should have green spaces, he was able to rev the governmental machinery into action and actually create a model urban park.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/park.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7898" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/park.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="park" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe made the move from writing about the importance of nature to setting up a large park near the city centre</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Travel as Therapy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In September 1786, after ten years in the Weimar civil service, when his fortieth birthday was coming into view, Goethe was gripped by the fear that he was wasting his life. He was weary of the cold winters, the endless meetings, the work load that made it hard to find time for writing. He headed for Italy &#8211; first to Vicenza and Venice where he was especially impressed by the buildings of Andrea Palladio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Villa_Rotonda_front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7901" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Villa_Rotonda_front.jpg?resize=635%2C428" alt="Villa_Rotonda_front" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe wanted his life to become<em> like</em> Palladio’s buildings: serene, ordered, sensuous and dignified</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then he went to Rome, which was his main base. He spent nearly two years in Italy. He had a very classical idea of the point of travel. The outer journey was intended to support an inner journey towards maturity. He felt that there was a part of himself that could only be discovered in Italy &#8211; &#8220;I am longing for grapes and figs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ash_ashm_wa1847_1_large.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7902" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ash_ashm_wa1847_1_large.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="ash_ashm_wa1847_1_large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Piazza del Popolo &#8211; 18th-century<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rome: Goethe’s flat was just a few steps from here &#8211; a few doors down the middle street between the two domes, on the left hand side</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But like many visitors to Rome, when he got there he felt disappointed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tumblr_nmvjwm2Omj1qd9m9xo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7903" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/tumblr_nmvjwm2Omj1qd9m9xo1_500.jpg?resize=635%2C456" alt="tumblr_nmvjwm2Omj1qd9m9xo1_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a collection of poems he wrote about his experience<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- <em>The Roman Elegies</em> &#8211; he describes how the great city seemed to be filled with lifeless ruins that were famous but didn’t actually mean anything to him: &#8220;speak to me, you stones!&#8221; he pleads. It’s a feeling many later visitors have had. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He realised that what he needed was not a more elaborate guide book, but the right person to have an affair with &#8211; someone who would share their love of Rome with him and show him the real meaning of the place. In a poem, he describes the woman he meets &#8211; he calls her Faustina. They spend lazy afternoons in bed; she’s not a great intellectual, she tells him about her life, about the buildings she passes on her way to the market &#8211; the Pantheon, a Baroque Church designed by Bernini &#8211; which she hadn’t realised were famous; they were just the buildings that happened to be around, that she happens to like. In his bedroom next to Faustina, Goethe realises that he’s entering into the spirit of Classical culture: a simple, comfortable relationship to sex and beauty; and the idea that the classical poets were people like him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image20.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7904" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image20.jpg?resize=635%2C578" alt="image20" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Goethe, the point of travel isn’t relaxation or just taking a break from routine. He’s got a bigger goal in mind: the aim of travel is to go to a place where we can find the missing ingredient of our own maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7905" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image16.jpg?resize=635%2C497" alt="image16" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The goal: maturity </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe didn’t stay in Italy. After nearly two years, he had developed enough to go back to Weimar and get on with his work political and creative work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Living Life to the Full: The Faustian Hero</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most striking things about Goethe is how much he did, how broad his horizons were, and how wide his interests were. He explored this particularly through his most famous work, <em>Faust</em>. Goethe worked on <em>Faust</em> all his life. The earliest sketches go back to his teens. And he only decided he’d done with it when he was in his early eighties. <em>Faust</em> comes in two parts and together the performance takes about thirteen hours. Goethe himself never saw the whole thing &#8211; and few people have since. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Faust is a medieval academic and scholar. He’s very learned but he doesn’t do very much: he is unfulfilled in love, he hasn’t made any money, and he has no power.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>His knowledge is sterile. His life feels pointless and he wishes he could die. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But then he is visited by a devil, called Mephistopheles &#8211; who offers him boundless energy, good looks and the ability to do whatever he wants. The question is: what will Faust want to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>do? The first danger for Faust is to stay an academic who resists worldly impact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/john-keats-966847.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7906" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/john-keats-966847.jpg?resize=635%2C643" alt="john keats-966847" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Hemmed in by heaps of books, </span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Piled to the highest vault and higher:</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Worm eaten, decked with dust’</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the Devil’s help he could be the ultimate bookworm: he could get his hands on the oldest, rarest manuscripts. But he gets weary of words and longs for action.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/faust_traum.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7907" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/faust_traum.jpg?resize=635%2C331" alt="faust_traum" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second danger is that he will use his new powers to gratify every sensual appetite. He will become a pure hedonist. Faust goes some way down this path: he goes to a bar and gets everyone<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>very drunk, he goes to a huge orgy &#8211; but then he realises that what he really seeks is beauty and love and this leads him on from sex and alcohol. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The third danger is that Faust will become a confident but shallow political leader. But in the second part of the play,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Faust pursues a grand purpose: eventually he organises the development of a new country &#8211; along the lines of the Dutch Republic &#8211; which at that time was the most Enlightened and successful society in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/koninck-extensive-landscape-road-river-NG6398-fm.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7908" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/koninck-extensive-landscape-road-river-NG6398-fm.jpg?resize=453%2C371" alt="koninck-extensive-landscape-road-river-NG6398-fm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The final wisdom: space for millions, </span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">free to work on fertile fields, where men and herds</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">can settle and gain comfort from the new-made earth:</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">a paradise, where hard working people win their freedom every day</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Faust</em> is a morality tale for all of us: he shows us both the pitfalls of life and how we might avoid them. Faust knows a great deal &#8211; but he resists being an academic; he loves sex, but he doesn’t give way to debauchery. He likes power but he doesn’t use it for megalomania: he puts it to work in the service of noble ends. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Faust’s career path is not unlike Goethe’s. Faust is essentially tracing for us a theory of how to live a full life. He is very interested in ideas, but not a scholar. He visits Italy, but doesn’t stay there. He goes back to work. He tries out administration and learns how to wield power, but once he has mastered this side of himself he moves on. The Faustian idea is that in order to develop fully, we have to flirt with things that are quite dangerous, but hold on to a sense of higher purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Goethes_Interview_with_Napoleon_at_Erfurt_The_Works_of_J._W._von_Goethe_Volume_14.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7909" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Goethes_Interview_with_Napoleon_at_Erfurt_The_Works_of_J._W._von_Goethe_Volume_14.png?resize=635%2C474" alt="Goethe's_Interview_with_Napoleon_at_Erfurt_(The_Works_of_J._W._von_Goethe,_Volume_14)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1807 the Emperor Napoleon tried to persuade Goethe to come and work for him &#8211; Goethe refused, but was glad to have the offer</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Science for Artsy People</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe was the last European to do a certain kind of remarkable thing -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to write great novels and plays and also play a significant role in science. His interests ranged through geology, meteorology, physiology and chemistry. But his most important work was in botany &#8211; in 1790 he produced his study, <em>Metamorphosis of Plants,</em> and on optics and colour, where his research was summed up in the <em>Theory of Colours</em> which was published in 1810. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thereafter, this combination of very significant work in the arts and in the sciences disappears from European civilisation completely. Goethe gives us some guidance as to why this has happened. Goethe is a hero for people of a more literary and artistic sensibility who are attracted from a distance to the broad subject matter of science &#8211; but who find the details of science less appealing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe likes science that you can do yourself, by looking carefully at the world around you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Goethes_Garten_am_Frauenplan.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7910" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Goethes_Garten_am_Frauenplan.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Goethes_Garten_am_Frauenplan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe did a lot of his research on plants in his own back garden in Weimar</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He did a lot of his research on optics with candles and coloured pieces of paper in his study. He liked the training this gave in asking oneself: what do I actually see? This could combat our tendency to see only what we expect. And also, it usefully turned our attention outwards, as a relief from preoccupation with ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GoetheFarbkreis.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7911" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GoetheFarbkreis.jpg?resize=402%2C419" alt="GoetheFarbkreis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe was very interested in the psychological aspect of our relationship to the sort of things that science investigates: plants, light, stones.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Rather than exclude the issues of personal meaning, Goethe sees these as central to the proper and full investigation of nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lorenzo_Lotto_046.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7912" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Lorenzo_Lotto_046.jpg?resize=635%2C556" alt="about 1530-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do the colours of her dress work well together</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wants to understand why green and russet silk make a great design combination &#8211; as an aid to couturiers and artists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> He was struck that different kinds of rock have a different character. And he chose granite &#8211; the hardest stone &#8211; for a monument to good fortune, which he put in his garden.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goethe-good-luck-stone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7913" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goethe-good-luck-stone.jpg?resize=361%2C471" alt="goethe-good-luck-stone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why is granite good for a monument to luck?</span></h5>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GOETHE_Cervus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7914" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GOETHE_Cervus.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="GOETHE_Cervus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What does an elephant jawbone (Goethe found it in a quarry near Weimar) mean to me? </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And he was very moved by the continuity between human life and the life of plants and animals. The point of studying an elephant’s jaw was to understand the traces of our evolution. Goethe thought of human nature as being a gradual refinement of animal nature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe was very worried by the direction that science was taking &#8211; which he particularly associated with the work of Isaac Newton. As Goethe saw it, the academic, profession scientist wasn’t interested in the personal meaning of the things they investigated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/newton-prism-experiment-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7915" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/newton-prism-experiment-2.jpg?resize=635%2C656" alt="newton-prism-experiment-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe thought Newton had ‘tortured’ light &#8211; breaking it up to extract its hidden secrets</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe’s point isn’t that Newton is technically wrong. It’s that he dislikes the direction of effort. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As he aged, Goethe kept on working. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GW485H540.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7916" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/GW485H540.jpg?resize=635%2C583" alt="GW485H540" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">He often dictated his ideas</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And he kept on seeking love &#8211; and sex. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ulrike_von_Levetzow.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7917" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ulrike_von_Levetzow.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="Ulrike_von_Levetzow" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">In his 70s, Goethe fell in love with Ulrike &#8211; his passion was unrequited</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe died at his house in Weimar in 1832. He was 83. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have so much to learn from him. We don’t often hear people declaring a wish to be a little more like ‘Goethe’. But if we did, the world would be a more vibrant and humane place.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Marcel Proust was an early 20th-century French writer responsible for what is officially the longest novel in the world: <em>À</em><em> la recherche du temps perdu</em> &#8211; which has 1,267,069 words in it; double those in <em>War and Peace</em>.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/768px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6686" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/768px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg?resize=635%2C602" alt="768px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Marcel Proust (seated), with Robert de Flers (left) and Lucien Daudet (right), ca. 1894</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The book was published in French in seven volumes over 14 years:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Du côté de chez Swann,</em> 1913</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>À l&#8217;ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs</em>, 1919</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Le Côté de Guermantes</em>, 1920</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Sodome et Gomorrhe</em>, 1922</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>La Prisonnière</em>, 1923</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Albertine disparue</em>, 1925</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Le Temps retrouvé</em>, 1927</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was immediately recognised to be a masterpiece, ranked by many as the greatest novel of the century, or simply of all time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes it so special is that it isn’t just a novel in the straight narrative sense. It is a work that intersperses genius-level descriptions of people and places with a whole philosophy of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The clue is in the title: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"><em>À</em><em> </em> la recherche du temps perdu</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"> In Search of Lost Time</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The book tells the story of one man &#8211; a thinly disguised version of Proust himself &#8211; in his developing search for the meaning and purpose of life. It recounts his quest to stop wasting time and start to appreciate existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Adrien_Proust_1834-1903.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6685" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Adrien_Proust_1834-1903.jpg?resize=635%2C570" alt="Adrien_Proust_1834-1903" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Adrien Proust</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marcel Proust wanted his book to help us. His father, Adrien Proust, had been one of the great doctors of his age, responsible for wiping out cholera in France. Towards the end of his life, his frail, indolent son Marcel, who had lived on his inheritance and had disappointed his family by never taking up a regular job, told his housekeeper Celeste: ‘If only I could do for humanity as much good with my books as my father did with his work.’ The important news is that he amply succeeded.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Proust’s novel charts the narrator’s systematic exploration of three possible sources of the meaning of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first is: <strong>SOCIAL SUCCESS</strong>. Proust was born into a comfortable bourgeois household; but from his teens, he began to think that the meaning of life might lie in joining high society, which in his day meant, the world of aristocrats, of dukes, duchesses and princes. We shouldn&#8217;t think ourselves superior for having no interest in these types. We&#8217;re much more likely to be implicated if we convert this category to its present day equivalent: celebrities and business tycoons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elizabeth_Comtesse_Greffuhle_1905__by_Philip_Alexius_de_Laszlo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6688" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elizabeth_Comtesse_Greffuhle_1905__by_Philip_Alexius_de_Laszlo.jpg?resize=635%2C534" alt="Elizabeth,_Comtesse_Greffuhle_1905_,_by_Philip_Alexius_de_Laszlo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Élisabeth, Countess Greffulhe, 1905, who served as the model for the character of the Duchesse de Guermantes</h5>
<p class="p1">For years, the narrator devotes his energies to working his way up the social hierarchy; and because he’s charming and erudite, he eventually becomes friends with lynchpins of Parisian high society, the Duke and Duchesse de Guermantes.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Comte_Henry_Greffulhe_par_Paul_Nadar.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6689" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Comte_Henry_Greffulhe_par_Paul_Nadar.jpg?resize=635%2C534" alt="Comte_Henry_Greffulhe_par_Paul_Nadar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Count Henry Greffulhe, 1881, who served as the model for the Duke of Guermantes</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a troubling realisation soon dawns on him. These people are not the extraordinary paragons he imagined they would be. The Duc’s conversation is boring and crass. The Duchesse, though well mannered, is cruel and vain.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marcel tires of them and their circle. He realises that virtues and vices are scattered throughout the population without regard to income or renown. He grows free to devote himself to a wider range of people. Though Proust spends many pages lampooning social snobbery, it’s in a spirit of understanding and underlying sympathy. The urge to social climb is a highly natural error, especially when one is young. It is normal to suspect that there might be a class of superior people somewhere out in the world and that our lives might be dull principally because we don’t have the right contacts. But Proust’s novel offers definitive reassurance: life is not going on elsewhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/686px-G._Caillebotte_-_Intérieur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6690" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/686px-G._Caillebotte_-_Intérieur.jpg?resize=635%2C668" alt="686px-G._Caillebotte_-_Intérieur" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The second thing that Proust’s narrator investigates in his quest for the meaning of life is: <strong>LOVE</strong>.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the second volume of the novel, the narrator goes off to the seaside with his grandmother, to the vogueish resort of Cabourg (the Barbados of the times). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There he develops an overwhelming crush on a beautiful teenage girl called Albertine. She has short hair, a boyish smile and a charming, casual way of speaking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barbara_Stanwyck_Ziegfeld_girl_by_Alfred_Cheney_Johnston_ca._1924.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6706" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barbara_Stanwyck_Ziegfeld_girl_by_Alfred_Cheney_Johnston_ca._1924.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Barbara_Stanwyck,_Ziegfeld_girl,_by_Alfred_Cheney_Johnston,_ca._1924" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">For about 300 pages, all the narrator can think about is Albertine. The meaning of life surely must lie in loving her. But with time, here too, there’s disappointment. The moment comes when the narrator is finally allowed to kiss Albertine:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Man, a creature clearly less rudimentary than the sea-urchin or even the whale, nevertheless lacks a certain number of essential organs, and particularly possesses none that will serve for kissing. For this absent organ he substitutes his lips, and perhaps he thereby achieves a result slightly more satisfying than caressing his beloved with a horny tusk…&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ultimate promise of love, in Proust’s eyes, is that we can stop being alone and properly fuse our life with that of another person who will understand every part of us. But the novel comes to dark conclusions: no one can fully understand anyone. Loneliness is endemic. We’re awkward, lonely pilgrims trying to give each tusk-kisses in the dark.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This brings us to the third and only successful candidate for the meaning of life: <strong>ART</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Proust, the great artists deserve acclaim because they show us the world in a way that is fresh, appreciative, and alive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_028.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6692" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_028.jpg?resize=635%2C522" alt="Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_028" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now the opposite of art for Proust is something he calls <b>habit. </b></span>For Proust, much of life is ruined for us by a blanket or shroud of familiarity that descends between us and everything that matters. It dulls our senses and stops us appreciating everything, from the beauty of a sunset to our work and our friends.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children don’t suffer from habit, which is why they get excited by some very key but simple things like puddles, jumping on the bed, sand and fresh bread.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/233031265_619c73665a_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6693" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/233031265_619c73665a_o.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="233031265_619c73665a_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we adults get ineluctably spoilt; which is why we seek ever more powerful stimulants (like fame and love).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The trick &#8211; in Proust’s eyes &#8211; is to recover the powers of appreciation of a child in adulthood, to strip the veil of habit and therefore to start to look upon daily life with a new and more grateful sensitivity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This for Proust is what one group in the population does all the time: artists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Artists are people who strip habit away and return life to its deserved glory, for example, when they lavish appropriate attention upon water lilies or service stations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/958px-Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6697" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/958px-Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C597" alt="958px-Claude_Monet_-_Water_Lilies_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Proust’s goal isn’t that we should necessarily make art or be someone who hangs out in museums. It’s to get us to look at the world, our world,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>with some of the same generosity as an artist, which would mean taking pleasure in simple things &#8211; like water, the sky or a shaft of light on a roughly plastered wall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no coincidence that Proust’s favourite painter was Vermeer: a painter who knew how to bring out the charm and the value of the everyday. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6699" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C537" alt="803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The spirit of Vermeer hangs over his novel: it too is committed to the project of reconciling us to the ordinary circumstances of life &#8211; and some of Proust’s most compelling pieces of writing describe the charm of the everyday: like reading on a train, driving at night, smelling blossom in spring time and looking at the changing light of the sun on the sea.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Proust is famous for having written about the dainty little cakes the French call ‘madeleines’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason has to do with his thesis about art and habit. Early on in the novel, the narrator tells us that he had been feeling depressed and sad for a while when one day he had a cup of herbal tea and a madeleine &#8211; and suddenly the taste carried him powerfully back (in the way that flavours sometimes can) to years in his childhood when as a small boy he spent his summers in his aunt’s house in the country. A stream of memories comes back to him, and fills him with hope and gratitude. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Tea_-_MFA_Boston_42.178.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6700" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Tea_-_MFA_Boston_42.178.jpg?resize=635%2C447" alt="640px-Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Tea_-_MFA_Boston_42.178" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thanks to the madeleine, Proust’s narrator has what has since become known as <strong>A PROUSTIAN MOMENT: </strong>a</span> moment of sudden involuntary and intense remembering, when the past promptly emerges unbidden from a smell, a taste or a texture.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through its rich evocative power, what the Proustian moment teaches us is that life isn’t necessarily dull and without excitement &#8211; it’s just one forgets to look at it in the right way: we forget what being alive, fully alive, feels like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1111px-Claude_Monet_022.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6704" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1111px-Claude_Monet_022.jpg?resize=635%2C514" alt="1111px-Claude_Monet_022" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moment with the tea is pivotal in the novel because it demonstrates everything Proust wants to teach us about appreciating life with greater intensity. It helps his narrator to realise that it isn&#8217;t his life which has been mediocre, so much as the image of it he possessed in voluntary memory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The reason why life may be judged to be trivial although at certain moments it seems to us so beautiful is that we form our judgement, ordinarily, not on the evidence of life itself but of those quite different images which preserve nothing of life &#8211; and therefore we judge it disparagingly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why artists are so important. Their works are like long Proustian moments. They remind us that life truly is beautiful, fascinating and complex, and thereby they dispel our boredom and ingratitude.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6701" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Starry_Night_Over_the_Rhone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Proust’s philosophy of art is delivered in a book which is itself exemplary of what he’s saying; a work of art that brings the beauty and interest of the world back to life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reading it, your senses are reawakened, a thousand things you normally forget to notice are brought to your attention, he makes you for a time, as clever and as sensitive as he was &#8211; and for this reason alone, we should be sure to read him and the 1.2 million life-giving words he so deftly assembled.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Austen is loved mainly as a charming guide to fashionable life in the Regency period. She is admired for portraying a world of elegant houses, dances, servants and fashionable young men driving barouches. But her own vision of her task was radically different. She was an ambitious &#8211; and stern &#8211; moralist. She was acutely conscious of human failings and she had a deep desire to make people nicer: less selfish, more reasonable, more dignified and more sensitive to the needs of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Born in 1775, Jane Austen grew up in a small village in Hampshire where her father was the Anglican rector. They had quite a high social status but were not at all well-off. She started writing young: at only twenty-one she had a novel turned down by a major publisher. During most of her adult life, Britain was at war with Napoleon. Two of her brothers became admirals. She did much of her writing at a tiny octagonal table. She was a very good dancer and very interested in being well-dressed. She was neat, elegant and lively. She never married, though on a couple of occasions she was tempted. Mostly she lived in pleasant small houses in the country with her sister Cassandra.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/698px-CassandraAusten-JaneAustenc.1810_hires1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4848" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/698px-CassandraAusten-JaneAustenc.1810_hires1.jpg?resize=635%2C373" alt="698px-CassandraAusten-JaneAustenc.1810_hires" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The novel was her chosen weapon in the struggle to reform humanity. She completed six: <em>Northanger Abbey, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Emma</em>, and <em>Persuasion</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the main things she wants to teach you are: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Let your lover educate you</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet start off heartily disliking each other and then, gradually realise they are in love. They make one of the great romantic couples. He is handsome, rich and well connected; she is pretty, smart and lively. But why actually are they right for one another? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Austen is very clear. It’s for a reason we tend not to think of very much today: It is because each can educate and improve the other. When Mr Darcy arrives in the neighbourhood he feels ‘superior’ to everyone else, because he has more money and higher status. At a key moment, Elizabeth condemns his arrogance and pride to his face. It sounds offensive in the extreme, but later he admits that this was just what he needed: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What did you say of me that I did not deserve? &#8230; The recollection what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expression is inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I never shall forget. You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you I was properly humbled.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elizabeth shares this view of love as education. They suit each other because: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It was a union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a lesson that sounds strange because we still tend to think of love as liking someone for who they already are, and of total acceptance. The person who is right for us, Austen is saying is not simply someone who makes us feel relaxed or comfortable; they have got to be able to help us overcome our failings and become more mature, more honest and kinder &#8211; and we need to do something similar for them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4849" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PRIDE AND PREJUDICE - 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, Darcy and Elizabeth improve one another and then the novelist lets them get engaged. The story rewards them because they have developed well. That’s why the novel feels so beautifully constructed. It’s not merely ingenious. It illustrates a basic truth: marriage depends on maturity and education. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We shouldn’t stop judging people; but we have to judge more carefully </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Mansfield Park</em> starts when quiet, shy Fanny Price goes to live with her much richer cousins, the Bertrams at Mansfield Park, their big house in the country. The Bertrams are smart, fashionable, confident and well-off. In social terms they are stars and Fanny is a very minor character indeed (her cousin Julia looks down on her because she doesn’t know where the different European countries are). But Jane Austen judges people by a completely different standard. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Austen exchanges the normal lens through which people are viewed in society, a lens which magnifies wealth and power, for a moral lens, which magnifies qualities of character. Rather than focus on who has the nicest dress, the best carriage, or the most servants, she examines who is vain, selfish or cruel; who has integrity, humility and true dignity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_1939932b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4852" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_1939932b.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="Mansfield Park - 1998" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through this lens, the high and mighty may become small, the forgotten and retiring figures may grow large. Within the world of the novel, virtue is spread without regard to material wealth: the rich and well-mannered are not (as in the dominant status schema) immediately good nor the poor and unschooled bad. Virtue may lie with the lame ugly child, the destitute porter, the hunchback in the attic or the girl who doesn’t know the first facts of geography. Certainly Fanny has no elegant dresses, has no money and can’t speak French – but by the end of <em>Mansfield Park,</em> she has been revealed as the noble one, while the other members of her family, despite their titles and accomplishments, have fallen into moral confusion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Austen is not the enemy of status. She just wants to see it properly distributed and at the end of her novels it always is. Fanny is raised up, and will become the mistress of Mansfield Park. Her selfish, empty-headed cousin Julia, is disgraced. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Take money seriously </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Austen is quite frank about money. She tells us the details of people’s financial status: In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> she explains that Mr Bingley has an income of GBP 4000 a year (which is clearly rather a lot); while Darcy has more than twice that. Rather than feeling that it is not quite polite to go on about people’s money or lack of it, she thinks that money is an eminently suitable topic for high-brow literature. Because how we deal with our finances has a huge effect on our lives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She takes aim at two big mistakes people make around money. One is to get over-impressed by what money can do. In <em>Mansfield Park</em>, Maria Bertram gets married to Mr Rushworth (the richest character in all Jane Austen’s novels) but they are miserable together and their marriage rapidly falls apart. But, equally, she is convinced that it is a serious error to get married without enough money. At one point in<em> Sense and Sensibility</em>, it looks like Elinor Dashwood and Edward Ferrars, who are otherwise well suited, won’t be able to get married: &#8220;they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year [a little below the middle-class average] would supply them with the comforts of life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_680121e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4854" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_680121e.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="'Sense and Sensibility' film - 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Elinor takes the view that &#8220;wealth has much to do with happiness&#8221; – though by wealth she doesn’t mean great luxury, just enough to live carefully in moderate comfort. Marriage, without a reasonable economic basis, is folly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jane Austen is steering her way towards an elusive &#8211; but crucial &#8211; attitude. Money is in some ways extremely important and in other ways unimportant. We can’t just be for it or against it. It sounds simple, of course, to assert this; and yet we are continually going wrong in practice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Don’t be snobbish</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>Emma</em>, the heroine &#8211; Emma herself &#8211; takes Harriet Smith a pretty girl from the village under her wing. Harriet is a very pleasant, modest and unassuming young woman. But Emma decides she should be much more than this. She wants Harriet to make a impressive match with the smart vicar. Harriet is swept off her feet by Emma’s excessive praise. She turns down a very suitable offer of marriage from a farmer, because she thinks him not good enough, though in fact he is thoroughly good hearted and quietly prosperous. The Vicar turns out to be horrified at Emma’s idea and Harriet has her heart broken. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s droll in the novel, but the underlying point is serious: Emma is unwittingly, but cruelly, snobbish. She is devoted to the wrong kind of hierarchy. Jane Austen does not think that the cure for snobbery is to think that everyone is equal. In her eyes, that would be immensely unjust. Rather, the real cure is to pay attention to true merit. The farmer is essentially a better person than the vicar; but social conventions and manners make it easy to ignore this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_588345g.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4856" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_588345g.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="'EMMA' FILM - 1996" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Few people are deliberately snobbish. And Jane Austen is careful to give this fault to Emma, who is in many ways an enchanting character. But eventually Emma is corrected. We see her recognise her error, feel very sorry and learn a life-long lesson. In other words, Jane Austen does not mock snobbery as the behaviour of ghastly and contemptible people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, she regards the snob with pity &#8211; as someone who lives a blighted life (however materially comfortable); they are in need of instruction, guidance and reform. But mostly, of course, they don’t get this help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Austen does not simply assert her concept of true hierarchy with the bluntness of a preacher, she enlists our sympathies for it and marshals our abhorrence for its opposite with the skill and humour of a great novelist. She does not tell us why her sense of priorities is important, she shows us why within the context of a story which also happens to make us laugh and grips us enough that we want to finish supper early to read on (as an early critic of Austen, Richard Whately, later the Archbishop of Dublin, put it in the <em>Quarterly Review</em> of 1822: &#8220;Miss Austen has the merit of being evidently a Christian writer: a merit which is much enhanced, both on the score of good taste, and of practical utility, by her religion being not at all obtrusive. She might defy the most fastidious critic to call any of her novels a ‘dramatic sermon&#8217;.&#8221;) Upon finishing one of the novels we are invited to go back into the sphere from which Austen has drawn us aside and respond to others as she has taught us, to pick up on and recoil from greed, arrogance and pride and to be drawn to goodness within ourselves and others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During her late thirties, Jane Austen had several productive years, living in a congenial and well-ordered house in the little village of Chawton in Hampshire. Her novels were increasingly well-received and she started making some money from them (though she never became famous because they were always published anonymously during her lifetime). In 1816, when she was forty, her health declined rapidly. She died the following year and was buried in Winchester Cathedral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Austen modestly and famously described her art as &#8220;the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as produces little effect after much labour,&#8221; but her novels are suffused with greater ambitions. Her art is an attempt, through what she called a study of &#8220;three or four families in a country village&#8221; to criticise and so alter life. She is the usual assumption that the exciting, important things are going on somewhere else and that we, unfortunately, are missing out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Austen might have written sermons. She wrote novels instead. Sadly, we refuse to read her novels as Austen would have wanted. The moral ambition of the novel has largely disappeared in the modern world, yet it is really the best thing that a novel can do. The satisfaction we feel when reading Austen is really because she wants the world to be a certain way which we find immensely appealing; it&#8217;s the secret, largely unrecognised, reason why she is so much loved as a writer.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leo Tolstoy was a believer in the novel not as a source of entertainment, but as a tool for psychological education and reform.</p>
<p>It was, in his eyes, the supreme medium by which we can get to know others, especially those who might from the outside seem unappealling, and thereby expand our humanity and tolerance.</p>
<p>He was born in 1828 at Yasnaya Polyana, a huge family estate, a hundred miles south of Moscow. It was to be his home, on and off, for the rest of his life.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/144527-004-D6D74356.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8108" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/144527-004-D6D74356.jpg?resize=635%2C259" alt="144527-004-D6D74356" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>His parents died when he was young and he was brought up by relatives. He flopped at university. One lecturer described him as being “unable and unwilling to learn.”</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8109" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C510" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Tolstoy at age 20, 1848</h5>
<p>He spent a few years gambling and drinking and chasing gypsy women, before signing on as an artillery officer in the Crimean War.</p>
<p>He got married in his early thirties. His wife Sophia, who came from a sophisticated, high-cultured background, was only eighteen. They had thirteen children, nine of whom survived infancy.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8110" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image10.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Sophia and their daughter Alexandra</h5>
<p>It was a difficult marriage; there were huge arguments about sex and bitterness on both sides. Leo grew a very long beard, became a fitness fanatic and spent most of his time in his study.</p>
<p>What he did there was to write several hugely successful books, among them, <i>War and Peace, Anna Karenina </i>and<i> The Death of Ivan Ilych. </i></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image05.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="The family of Russian author Leo Tolstoy, late 19th or early 20th century. Artist: Scherer Nabholz &amp; Co" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Tolstoy with his family<strong><br />
</strong></h5>
<p>Tolstoy did not believe in the idea of art for art’s sake. He was deeply invested in the belief that good art should make us less moralistic and judgemental and should be a supplement to religion in terms of developing our reserves of kindness and morality. This crusading moralistic side of Tolstoy has often been ignored by modern critics &#8211; who don’t wish to dirty art with a mission &#8211; but it is in fact the most important side of Tolstoy, and none of his efforts can properly be appreciated without keeping it in mind.</p>
<p>Tolstoy’s first great novel was <i>War and Peace</i>, published in 1869, when he was 41. In it, we meet Natasha Rostov, a delightful, free-spirited, young woman.</p>
<h5>                                    <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image06.jpg?resize=450%2C300" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<p>At the start, she is engaged to Andrey, a kind and sincere man who loves her deeply but is also rather emotionally remote and avoidant. While Andrey is away travelling in Italy, Natasha meets a handsome cynical waster called Anatole and falls under his spell. He almost manages to seduce her and persuades her to run away with him, though her family manage to stop her at the last minute. Everyone is appalled and furious with Natasha. This sort of madness wrecks her own prospects and deeply shames her family.</p>
<p>By the world’s standards, Natasha has failed terribly. If we encountered a news clip about such a person we might rapidly come to the conclusion that she lies beyond the range of normal sympathy. She had so much; she thought only of herself, she got what she deserved.</p>
<p>And yet Tolstoy’s view is that if we grasp what things are like for Natasha inside her mind, we can’t and won’t withdraw our sympathy. She isn’t in truth self-indulgent, frivolous or totally lacking in devotion. She’s just a sexually inexperienced young woman who feels abandoned by her preoccupied boyfriend. She is someone who has a deeply impulsive and warm nature and is easily carried away by joy and happiness. She is also acutely worried about letting other people down, which is what leads her into trouble with the scheming and manipulative Anatole.</p>
<p>Tolstoy keeps us on Natasha’s side and by doing so, he is getting us to rehearse a move he believes is fundamental to an ethical life: if we more accurately saw the inner lives of others, they couldn’t appear to us in the normal cold and one-dimensional was &#8211; and we would treat them with the kindness which they truly need and deserve. No one should be outside the circle of sympathy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>For Tolstoy, a particular task of the novel is to help us to understand the so-called ‘dislikeable’ characters. One of the most initially repellant characters in his fiction is the husband of Anna Karenina, the heroine of his great novel of the same name, the pompous and stiff Karenin. The novel, a tragedy, tells the story of the beautiful, clever, lively and very generous hearted married Anna, whose life falls apart when she falls in love with Vronsky &#8211; a splendid young cavalry officer.</p>
<p>Anna’s husband &#8211; Count Alexei Alexandrovich Karenin &#8211; is a fussy, status conscious, mannered high-ranking government official, who is often callous towards Anna and is unable to answer any of her emotional yearnings. As Anna’s affair with Vronsky develops, her husband’s main worry is that it might lead to social gossip which could undermine his public standing. He appears to have no feelings at all about the marriage itself. He comes across as simply cold and brutish.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8115" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Anna Karenina" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But then Anna gives birth to her lover’s child, she is ill, and &#8211; in a highly touching scene &#8211; Karenin is deeply moved, weeps for the infant, for the mother, and forgives Anna:</p>
<p><em>‘No, you can’t forgive me!’ [says Anna]. And yet he suddenly felt a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known: a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart. He knelt down, and laying his head in the curve of Anna’s arm; he sobbed like a little child.’</em></p>
<p>The hitherto cold Karenin falls in love with Anna’s baby:</p>
<p><em>For the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment, not of pity only, but also of tenderness. At first, from a feeling of compassion alone, he had been interested in the delicate little creature… Now he would go into the nursery several times a day&#8230; Sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the downy, wrinkled face of the sleeping baby, watching the movements of the frowning brows, and the fat little hands, with clenched fingers, that rubbed the little eyes and nose.</em></p>
<p>Thanks to the judicious Tolstoy, we see entirely unexpected aspects of the man. His inner life is not at all what we would expect, judging from the outside. But Tolstoy’s point is that Karenin is not really an exceptional character in this respect. He is just the normal mixture of bad and very good. It is highly usual for rather off-putting people to have huge reserves of buried tenderness: to have dimensions to their characters very different from  and often much nicer than those that their forbidding appearance suggests.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>We are invited on a comparable journey in relation to another character in Tolstoy’s fiction, the hero of the <i>The Death of Ivan Illych </i>(published in 1886). At the start of the novel, we meet Ivan, a high court judge at the pinnacle of society who appears selfish, vain and cynical. But one day, while helping hang some curtains, Ivan falls from a ladder and becomes aware of an inner pain which is the first sign of a disease which is soon diagnosed as fatal. He will have just a few months left to live. As his health declines, Ivan spends a lot of time sitting on the sofa at home.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>His family, aware at just how inconvenient his death will be to their social and financial standing, begin to resent him and his illness. He’s short and ill-tempered back. And yet inside, Ivan is going through a range of epiphanies. He looks back over his life and atones for its shallowness. He becomes newly sensitive to nature &#8211; and to the ordinary kindness of his manservant, a humble uneducated man of peasant stock. He grows furious at the stupid way in which everyone avoids paying attention to the one really crucial fact about life: that we all die. He realises that our mortality should be constantly before our minds and should inspire continual kindness and sympathy. As he dies, Tolstoy imagines him finally feeling pity and forgiveness for all those around him.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>As is typical in his writing, Tolstoy recounts in detail the vast philosophical and psychological dramas going on inside his hero’s head. All that those around him &#8211; the doctors and his family &#8211; get to see is a sullen man who spends a lot of time with his face to the wall, who is always saying ‘go away, leave me alone’ and who at times howls with misery, yet we can see a visionary, a prophet and a man of outstanding moral courage and generosity. In writing about Ivan, Tolstoy wanted us to see his life as representative of all human potential, if only we could wake up to it before it is too late.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>When he was about seventy, Tolstoy pulled together his thinking about being a writer in a long essay, <i>What is art?</i></p>
<p>It is one of his most important books. In it, Tolstoy proposes that art has a great mission. Through great art, he tells, us ‘Lower feelings – less kind and less needed for the good of humanity – are forced out and replaced by kinder feelings which better serve us individually and collectively. This is the purpose of art.’</p>
<p>As a supremely skilled and seductive writer, Tolstoy knew that novels need to be entertaining, or we simply won’t bother to read them. But he was also convinced that they have to aspire to be something else as well: key supports for our own stumbling path to maturity and kindness. And they can do this because they are able to get into a place we need but rarely have access to: the inner lives of other people.</p>
<p>In <i>What is art?</i>, Tolstoy was mostly writing about the works of other authors, but it is really his own achievement that he is, indirectly and modestly, summing up. Great writers shouldn’t ever be just helping their readers pass the time. Their writing must be a form of therapy, an attempt to educate us towards emotional health and ethical good sense.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>As they aged, the tensions between Leo and and his wife Sophia grew. He complained that they had “totally opposite ideas of the meaning of existence”. Ye he insisted that even as Sophia  “grew more and more irritable, despotic and uncontrollable” he continued to love her, though he admitted that he had given up trying to express his feelings. “There is no greater tragedy than the tragedy of the marital bed”, he wrote. Finally, when he was past eighty, Tolstoy couldn’t take it any more, and deserted his wife and family. He ran away in the middle of a freezing November night, caught pneumonia and died at the nearby railway station, where he was waiting for a train.</p>
<p class="p1">Tolstoy’s funeral was a major public occasion. Thousands showed up from across Russia and the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image08.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8117" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/image08.jpg?resize=635%2C377" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>This was fitting, for his central proposal has enormous social implications. He realised that our picture of what other people are like is a great driving force of relationships, economics and politics. He held up the tantalising idea that art could be the major vehicle for getting more accurate &#8211; and often much kinder &#8211; ideas about what is going on in the minds (and lives) of others.</p>
<p>His body was taken back to his house and buried in the garden, under some trees where he liked to play as a child.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Virginia Woolf was a writer concerned above all with capturing in words the excitement, pain, beauty and horror of what she termed the Modern Age. Born in 1882, she was conscious of herself as a distinctively Modernist writer, at odds with a raft of the staid and complacent assumptions of 19th-century literature.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She realised that a new era &#8211; marked by extraordinary developments in urbanism, technology, warfare, consumerism and family life &#8211; would need to be captured by a different sort of writer. Along with Joyce and Proust, she was relentlessly creative in her search for new literary forms that would do justice to the complexities of modern consciousness. Her books and essays retain a power to convey the thrill and drama of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/720px-Leslie_Stephen_c1860.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7872" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/720px-Leslie_Stephen_c1860.jpg?resize=635%2C591" alt="720px-Leslie_Stephen_c1860" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Woolf&#8217;s father, Sir Leslie Stephen</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Virginia Woolf was born in London: her father was a famous author and mountaineer, and her mother a well-known model. Her family hosted many of the most influential and important members of Victorian literary society. Woolf was largely cynical about these grand types, accusing them of pomposity and narrow-mindedness. Woolf and her sister weren’t allowed to go to Cambridge like their brothers, but had to steal an education in their father’s study.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/671px-Virginia_Woolf_and_Vanessa_Bell_children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7873" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/671px-Virginia_Woolf_and_Vanessa_Bell_children.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="671px-Virginia_Woolf_and_Vanessa_Bell_children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Woolf as a child playing cricket with her sister</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After her mother died when she was 13, Woolf had the first of a series of mental breakdowns that were to plague her for the rest of her life &#8211; partly caused by the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her half-brother George Duckworth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite her illness, she became a journalist and then a novelist &#8211; and a central figure in the Bloomsbury group, which included John Maynard Keynes, E.M. Forster, and Lytton Strachey. She married one of the members, the writer and journalist Leonard Woolf. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15a_vw_and_lw_hyde_park.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7874" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15a_vw_and_lw_hyde_park.jpg?resize=635%2C611" alt="15a_vw_and_lw_hyde_park" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The two Woolfs</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She and Leonard bought a small hand-printing press, named it The Hogarth Press, and published books from their dining room. They printed Woolf’s radical novels and political essays when no one else would; and produced the first full English edition of Freud’s works.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In just four short years between World Wars I and II, Woolf wrote four of her most famous works:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the essay</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</em> (1929)</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In March 1941, feeling the onset of another bout of mental illness, she drowned herself in the river Ouse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her work has many vital things to teach us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Notice Everything </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf is one of the great observers of English literature. Perhaps the finest short piece of prose she ever wrote was the essay, &#8220;The Death of the Moth,&#8221; published in 1942. It contains her observations as she sits in her study watching a humble moth trapped by a pane of glass. Rarely have so many profound thoughts been eked out from such an apparently minor situation (though for Woolf, there were no such things as minor situations):</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;One could not help watching him. One was, indeed, conscious of a queer feeling of pity for him. The possibilities of pleasure seemed that morning so enormous and so various that to have only a moth’s part in life, and a day moth’s at that, appeared a hard fate, and his zest in enjoying his meagre opportunities to the full, pathetic. He flew vigorously to one corner of his compartment, and, after waiting there a second, flew across to the other. What remained for him but to fly to a third corner and then to a fourth? That was all he could do, in spite of the width of the sky, the far-off smoke of houses, and the romantic voice, now and then, of a steamer out at sea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Virginia_Woolf_at_Monks_house.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7880" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Virginia_Woolf_at_Monks_house.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="640px-Virginia_Woolf_at_Monk's_house" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Woolf at Monk&#8217;s House</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf noticed everything that you and I tend to walk past: the sky, the pain in others’ eyes, the games of children, the stoicism of wives, the pleasures of department stores, the interest of harbours and docks… Emerson (one of her favourite writers) may have been speaking generally, but he captured everything that makes Woolf special when he remarked: “In the work of a writer of genius, we rediscover our own neglected thoughts.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In another great essay, &#8220;On Being Ill,&#8221; Woolf lamented how seldom writers stoop to describe illness, an oversight that seemed characteristic of a snobbery against the everyday in literature:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;English, which can express the thoughts of Hamlet and the tragedy of Lear, has no words for the shiver and the headache. The merest schoolgirl, when she falls in love, has Shakespeare or Keats to speak her mind for her; but let a sufferer try to describe a pain in his head to a doctor and language at once runs dry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would be her mission: Woolf tried throughout her life to make sure language would do a better job at defining who we really are, with all our vulnerabilities, confusions and bodily sensations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf raised her sensitivity to the highest art form. She had the confidence and seriousness to use what happened to her – the sensory details of her own life – as the basis for the largest ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Accept the Everyday</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf was always profound, but never afraid of what others called trivial. She was confident that the ambitions of her mind – to love beauty and engage with big ideas – were completely compatible with an interest in shopping, cakes and hats, subjects on which she wrote with almost unique eloquence and depth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In another particularly good essay of hers, called &#8220;Oxford Street Tide,&#8221; she celebrates the gaudy vulgarity of this huge London shopping street.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The moralists point the finger of scorn at Oxford street… it reflects, they say, the levity, the ostentation, the haste and the irresponsibility of our age. Yet perhaps they are as much out in their scorn as we should be if we asked of the lily that it should be cast in bronze, or of the daisy that it should have petals of imperishable enamel. The charm of modern London is that it is not built to last; it is built to pass.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/OxfordStreetCard.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7881" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/OxfordStreetCard.jpg?resize=635%2C380" alt="OxfordStreetCard" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Oxford Street in the 1930s</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an accompanying essay, equally open to the unprestigious side of modern life, Woolf goes to visit the giant docks of London:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“A thousand ships with thousand cargoes are being unladen every week. And not only is each package of this vast and varied merchandise picked up and set down accurately, but each is weighed and opened, sampled and recorded, and again stitched up and laid in its place, without haste, or waste, or hurry, or confusion by a very few men in shirt-sleeves, who, working with the utmost organisation in the common interest&#8230; are yet able to pause in their work and say to the casual visitor, &#8220;Would you like to see what sort of thing we sometimes find in sacks of cinnamon? Look at this snake!&#8221;. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Be a Feminist</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf was deeply aware that men and women fit themselves into rigid gender roles, and as they do so, overlook their fuller personalities. In her eyes, in order to grow, we need to do some gender-bending; we need to seek experiences that blur what it means to be “a real man” or “a real woman.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf had a few lesbian affairs in her life, and she wrote a magnificently bold queer text, <em>Orlando</em>, a portrait of her lover Vita, described as a nobleman who becomes a woman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/674px-Vita_sackville-west.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7882" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/674px-Vita_sackville-west.jpg?resize=635%2C581" alt="674px-Vita_sackville-west" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Vita Sackville-West in her twenties</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly.&#8221; (<em>A Room of One’s Own</em>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her anti-war tract, <em>Three Guineas</em>, Woolf argued that we will only ever end war by rethinking the habit of “pitting of sex against sex&#8230; all this claiming of superiority and imputing of inferiority&#8230; belong to the private-school stage of human existence where there are ‘sides,’ and it is necessary for one side to beat another side, and of the utmost importance to walk up to a platform and receive from the hands of the Headmaster a highly ornamental pot.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf wished desperately to raise the status of women in her society. She recognised that the problem was largely down to money. Women didn’t have freedom, especially freedom of the spirit, because they didn’t control their own income: ‘Women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time. Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves. Women have not had a dog’s chance of writing poetry.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her great feminist rallying cry, <em>A Room of One&#8217;s Own</em>, culminated in a specific, political demand: in order to stand on the same intellectual footing as men, women needed not only dignity, but also equal rights to education, an income of &#8220;five hundred pounds a year&#8221; and &#8220;a room of one’s own.&#8221; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">****</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woolf was probably the best writer in the English language for describing our minds without the jargon of clinical psychology. The generation before her, the Victorians, wrote novels focused on external details: city scenes, marriages, wills&#8230; Woolf envisioned a new form of expression that would focus instead on how it feels inside to know ourselves and other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Virginia_Woolf_in_Dreadnought_Hoax2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7883" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Virginia_Woolf_in_Dreadnought_Hoax2.jpg?resize=635%2C541" alt="Virginia_Woolf_in_Dreadnought_Hoax" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The Dreadnought hoaxers in Abyssinian regalia; Woolf is the bearded figure on the far left</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Books like Woolf’s—which aren’t overly sarcastic, caught up in adventure plots, or cradled in convention—are a contract. She’s expecting us to turn down the outside volume, to try on her perspective and to spend energy with subtle sentences. And in turn, she offers us the opportunity to notice the tremors we normally miss, and to better appreciate moths, our own headaches and our fascinating and fluid sexualities.</span></p>
