				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He described himself as an obsessional neurotic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Sigmund_Freud_LIFE11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4717" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Sigmund_Freud_LIFE11.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="640px-Sigmund_Freud_LIFE1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For although the father of modern psychology told us so much about our inner lives, he was touchingly vulnerable himself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sigmund Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856, in what is now the Czech Republic. He had a deep love for his mother, who called him her “golden Sigi”, and an equally deep hostility to his father, who may have threatened to cut off little Sigi’s penis if he didn’t stop touching it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His professional life was not an immediate success. As a young medical student, he dissected hundreds of male eels in an unsuccessful attempt to locate their reproductive organs, and ultimately failed to publish on the topic. He then turned his attention to a new exciting anaesthetic drug, trumpeting its amazing properties. But unfortunately cocaine turned out to be dangerous and addictive, and Freud had to stop advocating its medical use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few years later, he began at last to outline the discipline that would ultimately make his name: a new psychological medicine he called psychoanalysis. The landmark study was his 1900 book <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>. Many others followed, most importantly <em>The Psychopathology of Everyday Life</em> (1901), <em>The Cases of &#8216;Little Hans&#8217; and the Rat Man&#8217;</em> (1909), <em>Beyond the Pleasure Principle</em> (1920) and <em>Civilisation and Its Discontents</em> (1930).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despite his success as a doctor, author, and psychological expert, he was often unhappy. He was a workaholic and confided to a friend, “I cannot imagine life without work as really comfortable.” During a particularly strenuous part of his research he recorded, &#8220;The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He could be very jealous of his colleagues. He once fainted watching Carl Jung give a talk, and he forbid nearly all his students from even seeing Alfred Adler. He was convinced he would die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. He once panicked during a stay in Athens when his hotel room’s number was 31, half of 62. He soothed himself with his beloved cigar, but he was also very self-conscious about it, because he thought it was a replacement for his earlier masturbation habits. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng-in-front-of-clark-1909.jpe"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3540" src="http://www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng-in-front-of-clark-1909.jpe" alt="ng-in-front-of-clark-1909" width="635" height="434" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud with some of his colleagues. He was especially jealous of Carl Jung (far bottom right)</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet his private sorrows and anxieties were in fact part of his greatest contribution: his investigation into the strange unhappiness of the human mind. His work shows us that the conscious, rational part of the mind is, in his words, “not even master in its own house.” Instead, we are governed by competing forces, some beyond our conscious perception. We should attend to him-–however strange, off-putting, or humorous some of his theories may seem–because he gives us a wonderfully enlightening account of why being human is very difficult indeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">PLEASURE VS. REALITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud first put forward a theory about this inner conflict in his essay “Formulations on the Two Principles of Mental Functioning,” written in 1911. There he described the “pleasure principle,” which drives us towards pleasurable things like sex and cheeseburgers and away from unpleasurable things like drudgery and annoying people. Our lives begin governed by this instinct alone; as infants we behave more or less solely according to the pleasure principle. As we grow older, our unconscious continues to do the same, for “the unconscious is always infantile.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Sir_William_Quiller_Orchardson_1832-1910_-_Master_Baby.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3541" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/640px-Sir_William_Quiller_Orchardson_1832-1910_-_Master_Baby.jpg?resize=635%2C401" alt="640px-Sir_William_Quiller_Orchardson_1832-1910_-_Master_Baby" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies mostly follow the pleasure principle and directly seek pleasure while avoiding pain.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem, Freud said, is that as we get older we can’t simply follow the pleasure principle, as it would make us do crazy things like sleep with members of own family, steal other people’s cheeseburgers, and kill people who annoy us. We need to take into account what he called “the reality principle.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, we adjust to the demands of the reality principle in a useful, productive way: “a momentary pleasure, uncertain in its results, is given up, but only to gain along the new path an assured pleasure at a later time.” This is the underlying principle of so much of religion, education, and science: we learn to control ourselves and put away short-term pleasure to achieve greater (and usually more socially-acceptable) pleasure in the long run. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Freud noticed that in practice, most of us struggle with this. He believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations to reality; he called the troublesome ones neuroses. In cases of neuroses, we put aside–or repress–the pleasure drive, but at a cost. We become unhappy or even–in a sense–crazy, but we don’t understand the symptoms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, we might struggle to repress our attraction to people who are not our partner. However, this struggle is too painful to experience directly all the time, so we’ll unconsciously repress it. Instead, we’ll experience delusions of jealousy about our partner, and become convinced they are cheating on us. This is a projection of our true anxiety. It will quell some of our guilt about our wandering eye, but it may also drive us mad. It’s an adaptation to the challenges we face–but, of course, it isn’t really a very good one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud thought that life was full of these kinds of neuroses, brought on as the result of a conflict between our “id,&#8221; driven by the pleasure principle, and the “ego” , which rationally decides what we should do about the drives of the id. Other times neuroses come about because of a struggle between the ego and the superego, which is our moralistic side. </span></p>
<p class="p1">In order to understand these dynamics, we’ll usually need to think back to the time in our lives that generated so many of our neuroses:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CHILDHOOD</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Childhood is really the time when we learn different adaptations to reality, for the better or (often) for the worse. As babies, we emerge full of raw, unprincipled desires. As we are raised, however, we are “civilised” and thus brought into line with social reality. If we don’t adjust well, trouble will emerge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">First in our psychological history comes what Freud termed the “oral phase,” where we deal with eating. We’re born wanting to drink from the breast whenever we want. Yet over time, we have to be weaned. This is very difficult for us. If our parents aren’t careful (or worse, if they’re a little sadistic) we might pick up all kinds of neuroses: internalised self-denial, using food to calm ourselves down, or hostility to the breast. Most of all, we struggle with dependence. If our mothers wait too long, we may grow up to be very demanding and surprised when the outside world doesn’t provide everything we want. Or, we may learn to distrust dependence on others altogether.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then comes the “anal phase” (more commonly known as “potty-training”) where we face the challenges of defecation. Our parents tell us what to do and when to go–they tell us how to be good. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. We might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. We may then, as adults, become &#8220;anally retentive&#8221; and excessively tidy. We also might hold back from spending money. Alternatively, if our parents are too permissive, we may test authority and other people’s boundaries too frequently. This leads not only to “making messes” as a toddler, but also to being spendthrift and inconsiderate when we are older. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud says that the way our parents react matters a great deal. If they shame us when we fail to comply, we may develop all kinds of fears and anxieties. But at the same time we need to learn about boundaries and socially-appropriate behaviour. In short, potty training is the prime time for navigating the conflict between our own pleasure seeking and the demands of our parents. We have to adapt to these demands appropriately, or we’ll end up with serious problems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/937px-FreudFamily18981.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4710" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/937px-FreudFamily18981.jpg?resize=635%2C507" alt="937px-FreudFamily1898" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud and his family; the family as the focal scene of neurosis formation.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next comes the “phallic phase” (it goes until about age 6), where we address the problems of genital longings and newly-emerged, impossible sexual wishes. Freud shocked his contemporaries by insisting that little children are sexual: they have sexual feelings, they get erections, they masturbate, they want to rub themselves on various objects and people (even now, the idea makes people uncomfortable). In Freud’s time, the kid would be told to stop it violently; now we tell them this gently. But the point is the same: we can’t permit childhood sexuality. For the child, this means that a very powerful part of their young self is firmly repressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is even more complicated because children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents. Freud described what he called the Oedipus complex (named after the Greek tragic figure), in which we are all unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” It sounds very strange, but it’s worth attending to all the same. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It starts like this: as children, most of us are very attached to our mothers. In fact, Freud says that little boys automatically direct their primitive sexual impulses towards her. Yet no matter how much she loves us, mum will always have another life. She probably has a relationship (likely with our dad) or if not, a number of other priorities that leave us feeling frustrated and abandoned as children. This makes our infant selves feel jealous and angry – and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. A small male child will particularly feel hatred towards the person who takes mum away and also be afraid that that person might kill him. This entire complex–now the word makes sense–provides a huge amount of anxiety for a small child already. (In Freud’s view, little girls have it no easier–they just have a slightly different complex).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4255_16289851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4712" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4255_16289851.jpg?resize=635%2C523" alt="4255_1628985" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Childhood is fraught with jealousy and related attachment issues, especially towards our mothers.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then comes the problem of actual incest. Adults should not have sex with children; this is a very serious incest taboo on which society depends. We’re not supposed to have sex with people we’re related to either. But even though we claim to all be horrified by it, as if incest were simply the last thing on our mind, Freud reminds us that things are never made into a taboo unless quite a lot of people are keen on breaking the taboo in their unconscious. This explains all the hysteria around incest and sex with children–the idea of it is lurking somewhere in the back of our minds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to prevent sex in the family, the child has to be weaned off the desire to have sex with mum or dad. Mum or dad need also to be kind and not make them feel guilty about sex. But all kinds of things can go terribly wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Most of us experience some form of sexual confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad both give us love, but they mix it in with various kinds of troubling behaviour. Yet because we love them and depend on them, we remain loyal to them and also to their destructive patterns. So for example, if our mother is cold and makes belittling comments, we will be apt nevertheless to long for her or even find her very nice. As a result, however, we may be prone to always associate love with coldness.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ADULTHOOD</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, we should be able to have genital sex without trouble, and in the long term, fuse love and sex together with someone who is kind. Of course, it rarely happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically, we can’t fuse sex and love: we have a sense that sex doesn’t belong with tender feelings. “A man of this kind will show a sentimental enthusiasm for women whom he deeply respects but who do not excite him to sexual activities,” noted Freud, “and he will only be potent with other women whom he does not ‘love’ but thinks little of or even despises.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hedgehogs-206407_6401.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4713" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/hedgehogs-206407_6401.jpg?resize=635%2C382" alt="hedgehogs-206407_640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud compared the issues we so often have with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also can’t come too close because they’re prickly. He borrowed this analogy from another Great Thinker, Schopenhauer.</span></h5>
<p class="p1">Neuroses aren&#8217;t just created within individuals. The whole of society keeps us neurotic. In his book <em>Civilisation and its Discontents</em> (1930), Freud wrote that a degree of repression and psychological dysfunction is simply the cost of living in a society. Society  insists on regulating sex, imposes the incest taboo, requires us to put off our immediate desires, demands that we follow authority and makes money available only through work. A non-repressive civilisation is a contradiction.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ANALYSIS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud attempted to invent a cure for neurosis: psychoanalysis. But from the outset, the offering was very limited. He thought the patient should be under fifty, or else their minds would be too rigid. It was very expensive, especially since he thought his patients should come four times a week. And he was quite pessimistic about the outcome: he believed that at best he could transform hysterical unhappiness into everyday misery. Nevertheless, he thought that with a little proper analysis, people could uncover their neuroses and better adjust to the difficulties of reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6888951554_1fd5fba460_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4714" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6888951554_1fd5fba460_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="6888951554_1fd5fba460_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud’s office in London, with a couch for his patients to sit or lie on as they were analysed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some of the things Freud sought to “analyse” in his sessions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DREAMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud believed that sleep was a chance for us to relax from the difficulties of being conscious, and especially to experience what he called wish-fulfilment. It might not seem obvious at first. For example, we might think we dream about failing our A-levels simply because we’re stressed at work. But Freud tells us that we actually get these kinds of dreams because some part of us wishes that we’d failed our A-levels, and thus didn’t have all the responsibilities of adulthood, our job, and supporting our family. Of course, we also have more intuitive wish-fulfilment dreams, like the ones where we sleep with a beguiling co-worker we had never, in the day, known we liked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once we wake, we must return to the world and the dictates of our moralistic superego–so we usually repress our dreams. This is why we quickly forget the really exciting dreams we had. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">PARAPRAXES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud loved to notice how his patients used words. He thought it was particularly telling when they had a slip of the tongue, or a parapraxis (we now call these revealing mistakes “Freudian slips”). For example, Freud wrote of a man who asked his wife (whom he didn&#8217;t actually like) to come join him in America. The man meant to suggest that she take the ship the Mauretania, but in fact he wrote that she should come on the Lusitania &#8211; which was sunk off the coast of Ireland by a German submarine in WWI, resulting in the loss of all on board. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">JOKES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud thought that humour was a psychological survival-mechanism. In his <em>Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious, </em>he explained: &#8220;Jokes make possible the satisfaction of an instinct (whether lustful or hostile) in the face of an obstacle that stands in its way.&#8221; In short, jokes–like dreams–allow us to bypass authority and satisfy wishes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">**</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1933, the Nazis rose to power. &#8220;What progress we are making,&#8221; Freud told a friend. &#8220;In the Middle Ages they would have burnt me; nowadays they are content with burning my books.&#8221; Even he failed to see what the world was up against with the Nazis. Elite friends and a sympathetic Nazi officer helped him and his family escape to London, where he lived for the rest of his life. He died in 1939 of jaw cancer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Following in Freud’s footsteps, other analysts developed new psychoanalytic techniques, and eventually the wide and varied field of modern psychiatry. Much of modern therapy is very different from Freud’s, but it began with his premise of discovering the dark and difficult parts of our inner lives and unwinding them, slowly, under the guidance of a trained listener. </span></p>
<p class="p1">We may think we’ve outgrown him, or that he was ridiculous all along. There’s a temptation to say he just made everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning we find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work and we’re reminded all over again just how elusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course. But as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">&#8216;Defensive&#8217; behaviour is at the root of a lot of the trouble we have with ourselves and others. It leads us to direct blame inaccurately, to hear reasonable criticisms as cruel attacks and to resort to sarcasm and irony as an alternative to sincerity.</p>
<p class="p1">The finest guide to the origins of defensive behaviour was the psychoanalyst, and daughter of Sigmund, Anna Freud. Anna was the youngest of the family’s six children. She was born in Vienna in 1895 – when her father’s radical theories of sex and the mind were starting to make him famous across<em> fin de siècle</em> Europe. Anna was regarded as a ‘plain’ child and she struggled at school, where she acquired a dire nickname – ‘black devil’. But later she became a school teacher and then a psychoanalyst – and pioneered the treatment of children.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4720" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sigmund_en_Anna.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="Sigmund_en_Anna" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">In 1934, she published<em> The Ego and Mechanisms of Defence</em> &#8211; the book that laid out for the first time the core idea that we instinctively try to protect our ‘ego’ (our acceptable picture of who we are) with a variety of defences. A defence mechanism is a method of response intended to spare us pain; the problem is that in the act of defending ourselves in the immediate term, we harm our longer-term chances of dealing with reality and therefore of developing and maturing as a result.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anna Freud highlighted ten key types of defence mechanism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>One: Denial</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t admit there is a problem. We think things like: ‘I enjoy drinking very much and I sometimes get quite bad hangovers. But I don’t drink too much.’ Or; ‘I spend quite a lot of money. But no more than other people. I wouldn’t say I am a financially irresponsible person.’ If other people (relatives, friends, a partner) try to get us to admit there is a problem, we tend to react very badly. </span></p>
<p class="p2">The immediate survival mechanism – the short term instinct to feel all right about oneself – is to refuse to recognise there is a problem because admitting it means we’re going to have to do all sorts of difficult and awkward things about it. But denial gets in the way of long-term coping.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/378969553_b6c8477645_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9187" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/378969553_b6c8477645_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="378969553_b6c8477645_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, pure denial doesn’t quite feel safe enough. One creates a bit of evidence on the other side. A nine-year-old boy – who’d sometimes very much like a cuddle from his mother but is reluctant to admit this to himself – might say that she’s mean and annoying. He’s ‘proving’ to himself that he doesn’t need her, so when he feels a bit weepy and lonely, it can’t possibly be because he needs his mummy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Denial isn’t a lie. This defence mechanism is like a smoke-screen that makes it very hard for us to see what’s going on in our own lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Projection</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">This involves recognising a negative feeling, but instead of seeing that it is one’s own dark emotion, the feeling is given to (or projected onto) someone else.  This can sound weird and complicated, but it happens a lot.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You get a note saying the boss wants to see you personally about something serious. Your first instinct might be to imagine that they are going to fire you, explain how they’ve found out some terrible facts about you. You’ve got a picture in your head of this person being cold, forceful and very angry. When you get to the meeting, you just hear some useful guidance about an important new contract that’s coming up. So, all the emotions – the terror, the coldness, the vindictive anger – are actually coming from you. You projected them onto your senior colleague. You have given the negative feelings, which you don’t want to recognise in yourself, to someone else.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4992455554_9256c36d75_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9184" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4992455554_9256c36d75_z.jpg?resize=635%2C514" alt="Business Day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or, you feel that your partner is going to be extremely critical if you don’t make more money this year than last year. You fret a lot about this; you imagine the cutting remarks they’re going to make, the withering looks. But in reality they don’t have these feelings. They may be genuinely understanding and sympathetic (though, yes, of course, it would be nice if your income was on the rise). The harsh, bitter thoughts are not in your partner. They are in you – and they came from your mother, let’s say. But you project them onto the nearest candidate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, instead of being very frustrated with yourself (a highly uncomfortable feeling), you can feel hard done by (a slightly easier feeling). After all, you’ve got – at least, in your head – such a pushy, never-satisfied partner. Instead of facing the painful and difficult question of why you can’t make more – or why it isn’t ok for you that you make what you do – you create a diversion: your ‘annoying’ partner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Turning against the self </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We turn to defence mechanisms to protect ourselves from psychological suffering. So it sounds paradoxical to say (as Anna Freud insisted) that hurting oneself – being angry with, or loathing oneself could be a defence. It’s a matter of what we find most frightening. There may be many things which scare us much more than disliking ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defences can be traced back to childhood. And a child abandoned, or harmed by, a parent might well seek refuge in a thought which, though grim, is less awful than the alternatives. I (feels the child) must be bad and worthless, I&#8217;m an awful person – that’s why my parent is behaving this way. So, really – the thought goes – I still have a good parent. It’s painful – but may be less catastrophic than the truth: one is actually in the hands of someone who doesn’t care. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Sublimation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This involves redirecting unacceptable thoughts or emotions into ‘higher’ and ideally more constructive channels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many musicians have turned negative life experiences—drug addiction, social ills, family problems, and so on—into popular and resonating performances and songs, which have served to energise and inspire many people. Troubled artists such as Vincent van Gogh, who struggled with an absinth addiction that famously led him to cut off his ear, was able to channel his problems into his artwork and create intensely memorable images. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/712px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_4540451.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4728" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/712px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_4540451.jpg?resize=635%2C537" alt="712px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project_454045" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art gives us the most conspicuous examples of a more widespread possibility. An aggressive impulse to tell everyone what to do and to impose one’s will without restraint, may be sublimated into a determination to make one’s work accurate and impressive. A fascistic impulse may be redirected into a socially beneficial aspiration for order and coherence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Regression</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often enough childhood seems – in retrospect at least – a time of safety. As a child one was shielded from responsibility. One was not expected to understand, to take difficult decisions, to be consistent, to be good at explaining what the matter was. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In regression – as a defence – one becomes childish in some crucial way. One might, for instance dither a great deal, rather than take a decision – and bear responsibility for the consequences. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A core feature of regression is the conviction that troubles are always the fault of other people. It’s a strategic return to the child’s belief that the parents rule the world and can do anything, so if anything goes wrong they could and should put it right. And the one person who cannot possibly be blamed is, of course, the child.</span></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-1.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="8691742996_5053244d52_z (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tantrum is a characteristic regressive defence mechanism. Rather than try to work out a solution to a problem, one tries (in the logic of childhood) to solve it by getting upset. In the adult world this can look crazy. But babies really do have to signal for help by crying, screaming and banging their fists. It’s absolutely the best they can do. So the tantrum means, in effect – I cannot be responsible for this situation: you must help me because I am only a baby. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Rationalisation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rationalisation is a smart sounding excuse for our actions (or what happens to us). But it’s carefully tailored to get the conclusion we feel we need: that we are innocent, nice, worthy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One key type of rationalisation involves doing down the things one does not have but secretly would like. After being rejected for a job, the defensive rationaliser will say: “it was a boring company” or “I never wanted the job anyway”. They may have very much desired the job. But it can be agonising and deeply humiliating to admit this to oneself. So, a more acceptable sense of oneself is preserved by creating the reasonable, careful – rational – sounding fiction: it wasn’t actually a very good job, now I come to think of it more seriously. But it’s not the assessment of the merits of the job that leads to the conclusion; rather it’s the urgent psychological need to protect one’s self esteem. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Intellectualisation </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Intellectualisation is similar. It involves ignoring something very painful and important by starting a highly plausible conversation inside one’s head about something entirely different. The scarring sense of loss,  guilt, betrayal and anger on breaking up with a partner might be neutralised by thinking about the history of the late Roman Empire or the government’s plan to raise interest rates. Many intellectuals are not merely thinking a lot. They are also guilty of ‘intellectualisation’; making sure their researches keep a range of more pertinent issues at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Reaction formation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reaction formation involves doing the opposite of our initial, unacceptable feelings. We might call it ‘over-compensating’. Someone who has a strong interest in sex with teenagers may, for instance, join a religion with a particular emphasis on abstinence among the young. We are often guilty of reaction formation in childhood. When we are embarrassed about being attracted to a classmate, we might be mean or aggressive towards them, instead of admitting our attraction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4401531673_98d83699c1_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9185" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4401531673_98d83699c1_b.jpg?resize=635%2C544" alt="an action shot of a group of Caucasian children frolicking in natural surrounds on a summer's day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: Displacement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Displacement is the redirection of a (usually aggressive) desire to a substitute recipient. It is generally engendered by a frustrating person appearing to us as a threat and us reacting to it by directing our feelings towards someone/something else who is easier to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So a classic case is someone who may feel threatened by their boss and comes home and shouts at their partner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ten: Fantasy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fantasy is another escapist mechanism. It avoids problems by imagining them away or disassociating oneself from reality. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fantasy manifests in a range of everyday scenarios—from daydreaming to reading literature to looking at porn. We use these moments to transport ourselves from the threatening world to find comfort elsewhere. After a bad day at work, for instance, you might sink into an action film, listen to psychedelic music or log on to youporn.com. Such activities enable us to escape our real problems or concerns. The travel industry relies on our need to fantasise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3500343676_39d454e638_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9186" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3500343676_39d454e638_z.jpg?resize=635%2C438" alt="3500343676_39d454e638_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">**</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In March 1938, four years after writing the book on defence mechanisms, Anna moved to London with her family, to escape the Nazi occupation of Vienna. After the war, with a friend, Kate Friedlaender, who specialised in juvenile delinquency, she set up child therapy courses at a nursery and clinic in Hampstead.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She died in 1982. Her ashes were placed next to her parents in the Golders Green Crematorium in north London, in an ancient Greek funeral urn, together with those of her lifelong partner and colleague Dorothy Tiffany-Burlingham.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusions </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anna Freud started from a position of deep generosity towards defence mechanisms. We turn to them because we feel immensely threatened. They are our instinctive ways of warding off danger and limiting psychological pain. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anna Freud keeps reminding us that the defences are not voluntary. They are not conscious deliberate choices. We don’t realise what we’re doing. We don’t think of ourselves as being defensive. We don’t see that we’re in denial, or that we’re rationalising. T</span>he role of a defence mechanism isn’t to get at a truth, but to ward off distress.</p>
<p class="p1">Anna Freud is teaching a lesson in modesty. For she reveals the extreme probability that defence mechanisms are playing a marked and powerful role in one’s own life – though without it being obvious to oneself that this is so. It’s a humbling thought – and one that should induce a little more gratitude to those who consent to live their lives in close proximity to us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Melanie_Klein_c1900-635x848.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4732" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Melanie_Klein_c1900-635x848.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="Melanie_Klein_c1900-635x848" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melanie Klein (1882-1960) was a highly creative and original Viennese Jewish psychoanalyst who discovered the work of Freud at the age of 26 and devoted her life to enriching and nuancing it in intriguing and valuable ways. She is perhaps best remembered today for an unlikely-sounding but inherently sensible theory, advanced in her book <i>The Psychoanalysis of Children</i> (1932), about a ‘good breast’ and a ‘bad breast’ – of which more in a minute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Freud had achieved renown by evoking for us just how deeply unacceptable many of our desires are in their raw, undisguised forms. Beneath the civilised surface, in our unconscious minds, we are motivated by what the inventor of psychoanalysis called ‘the pleasure principle,’ which incites us to want a shifting array of surprising, anarchic and (from an everyday point of view) simply shocking things. We want to kill, castrate and maim our enemies, be the most powerful people on earth, have sex with unusual body parts of men, women and children, pair off with members of our own families and become immortal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1191" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/105698990.jpg" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So explosive, peculiar and dangerous are these wishes, they must be overruled by the rational mind, or ego, if we are to get on in the world. But this process can go more or less well, depending on how our conscious minds emerge from the vagaries of childhood. At worst, in our attempts to quash these impossible unconscious demands, we fall prey to rigid neuroses and inhibitions, which defend us from what we want, but only at a high cost: we become uncreative and severely hampered in daily life. For example, we might become unable to leave the house (so afraid is a part of us that we could try to murder someone); we might become impotent (for we’re somewhere deep down terrified of the aggression of a father figure in relation to our potency); or we might fail at everything we do (to make sure we don’t rival a sibling we secretly envy and yet dread). It is these sort of neuroses that psychoanalysis was designed to help us understand and patiently unpick, so that we might eventually make more flexible, less inhibited adjustments to reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melanie Klein discovered psychoanalysis in 1914 and was at once captivated by its ambition and wisdom. A highly intelligent woman, she had been held back by her father from her desire to become a doctor and had been pushed by her family into a loveless marriage with a coarse, unpleasant man with whom she had nothing in common. She was bored, sexually frustrated and mentally unwell. Psychoanalysis saved her. She left her husband, read everything she could, attended lectures, and started publishing papers of her own. She soon departed from Freud in an area that most other analysts had overlooked: the analysis of children. Freud had been sceptical that children could ever be analysed properly, their minds being in his view too unformed to allow for a perspective on the unconscious. But Klein now argued that an analyst could get a useable view into a child’s inner world through studying how they played with toys in his or her presence. She therefore equipped her consulting room with small horses, figurines and locomotives and made the observation of how children played with them a centrepiece of her clinical work. She was to establish herself as a child psychoanalyst, first in Berlin and then in London, where she settled in 1926 and remained for the rest of her life (becoming a star among the Bloomsbury group and particular friends with Virginia and Leonard Woolf).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3354371.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4735" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3354371.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="Form Board" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her work with children, Klein wanted to understand how human beings evolve from the primitive pleasure seeking impulses of early infancy to the more mature adaptations of later life – and in particular, she wanted to know what might go wrong on this journey, giving rise to the neurotic adaptations of adults.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was first and foremost struck by the difficulty of the young infant’s situation (in the words of the psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva, Klein described the newborn’s days and nights ‘with the horror of a Hieronymus Bosch painting’). Weak, utterly at the mercy of adults, unable to grasp what is happening, the infant cannot – in Klein’s description – grasp that people around it are in fact <i>people</i>, with their own alternative reality and independent points of view. In the early weeks, the mother is not even ‘a mother’ to her child, she is – to come to the crux of the issue – just a pair of breasts which appear and disappear with unpredictable and painful randomness. In relation to this mother, all the infant experiences are moments of intense pain and then, for reasons it can’t understand, moments of equally intense pleasure. When the breast is there and the milk flows, a primordial calm and satisfaction descends upon the infant: it is suffused with feelings of well-being, gratitude and tenderness (feelings that will, in adulthood, be strongly associated with being in love, a moment where breasts continue to play a notable role for many). But when the breast is desired and yet for whatever reason it is missing, then the infant is thrown into unfathomable panic: it feels starving, enraged, terrified and vengeful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This, thought Klein, leads the infant to adopt a primitive defence mechanism against what would otherwise be intolerable anxiety. It ‘splits’ the mother into two very different breasts: a ‘good breast’ and a ‘bad breast’. The bad breast is hated with a passion; the infant wants to bite, wound and destroy this object of unholy frustration. But the good breast is revered with an equally thorough though more benign intensity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/122214529-11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4744" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/122214529-11.jpg?resize=635%2C593" alt="Madonna of the Milk and Saint Joseph by workshop of Giuseppe Nuvolone, oil on canvas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With time, in healthy development, this ‘split’ heals. The child will gradually perceive that there is in truth no entirely good and no entirely bad breast, both belong to a mother who is a perplexing mixture of the positive and the negative: a source of pleasure <i>and</i> frustration, joy <i>and </i>suffering. The child (for, by now, we are talking of someone aged around 4 years old) discovers a key idea in Kleinian psychoanalysis: the concept of <i>ambivalence</i>. To be able to feel ambivalent about someone is, for Kleinians, an enormous psychological achievement and the first marker on the path to genuine maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it isn’t inevitable or assured. The grey area is hard to reach. Only slowly can a healthy child grasp the crucial distinction between intention and effect, between what a mother may have wanted for it and what the child might have felt at her hands nevertheless. While no sane mother would ever want to frustrate and scare her own child, this child might nevertheless have been badly hurt and confused by her. These complicated psychological realisations belong to what Klein called ‘the depressive position,’ a moment of soberness and melancholy when the growing child takes on board (unconsciously) the idea that reality is more complicated and less morally neat than it had ever previously imagined: the mother (or other people generally) cannot be neatly blamed for every setback; almost nothing is totally pure or totally evil, things are a perplexing, thought-provoking mixture of the good and bad… This is hard to take and – for Klein – explains the serious faraway look that may sometime enter the eyes of children during daydreams. These small beings look oddly wise and grave at such moments; they are, somewhere deep inside, cottoning on to the moral ambiguity of the real world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1385826951.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4739" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/1385826951.jpg?resize=635%2C503" alt="Prince William, elder son of the Duke of Gloucester - 5-March-1945" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, in Klein’s analysis, not everyone makes it to the depressive position, for some get stuck in a mode of primitive splitting she termed (somewhat dauntingly) the ‘paranoid-schizoid position’. For many years, even into adulthood, these cursed people will find themselves unable to tolerate the slightest ambivalence: keen to preserve their sense of their own innocence, they must either hate or love. They must seek scapegoats or idealise. In relationships, they tend to fall violently in love and then – at the inevitable moment when a lover in some way disappoints them – switch abruptly and become incapable of feeling anything anymore. These unfortunates are likely to move from candidate to candidate, always seeking a vision of complete satisfaction, which is repeatedly violated by an unwitting error on the lover’s part.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t have to believe in the literal truth of Klein’s theory to see that it has value for us as an unusual but useful representation of maturity. The impulse to reduce people into what they can do for us (give us milk, make us money, keep us happy), rather than what they are in and of themselves (a multifaceted being with their own often elusive centre of gravity), can be painfully observed in emotional life generally. With Klein’s help, we learn that coming to terms with the ambivalent nature of all relationships belongs to the business of growing up (a task we’re never quite done with) – and is likely to leave us a little sad, if not for a time quite simply depressed.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald Winnicott deserves his place in history because of the dramatic simplicity of his approach. He proposed that the happiness and future satisfaction of the human race depended ultimately not so much on external political issues, but on something far closer to home: the way parents bring up their children. All the sicknesses of humanity were, in his view, in essence consequences of a failure of parental provision. Fascism, delinquency, rage, misogyny, alcoholism, these were only the symptoms of poor childhoods that the collective would have to pay for. The road to a better society begins in the nursery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1159" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/173345694.jpg" alt="A Day Inside German Children's Daycare" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was an English paediatrician, who early on in his career became passionate about the then new field of psychoanalysis. He was analysed by James Strachey, who had translated Freud into English, and became Britain’s first medically-trained child psychoanalyst. He worked as a consultant in children’s medicine at the Paddington Green Children’s Hospital in London, and also played a crucial role in public education around child-rearing, delivering some 600 talks on the BBC, tirelessly lecturing around the country and authoring 15 books, among which the bestselling <i>Home is Where We Start From.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It must have felt very odd, in 1954, to tune into BBC Radio at prime time and hear someone with a gentle, intelligent voice arguing incisively against the idea that babies cry ‘to get attention’ or that sending seven year olds to boarding school might be a good idea so as to ‘toughen them up.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/506420051.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4747" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/506420051.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="Resident of boarding school for members" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was rather strange, too, that Winnicott should even have been English, given that his country was notorious, then as now, for its lack of tenderness and its resistance to introspection (and its commitment to irony, detachment and sarcasm instead). As he pointed out: ‘The Englishman does not want to be upset, to be reminded that there are personal tragedies all over the place, that he is really not happy in himself; in short, he refuses to be put off his golf.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet Winnicott’s brand of psychoanalysis was, on closer inspection, peculiarly English. He wrote pragmatic, homespun prose, expressing the deepest ideas in plain, unadorned language. There was no German incomprehensibility or abstraction here. There was also a characteristic English modesty about what he saw as the point of child psychoanalysis. He wanted to help people to be, in his famous formulation, ‘good enough’ parents; not brilliant or perfect ones (as other nations might have wished), but just OK. And that was because he displayed, to a high degree, the downbeat, modest, realistic, temperament which is the particular glory of the English mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1162" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/110685605.jpg" alt="The UK Faces Budget Day As It Attempts to Recover From The Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an early paper, he announced his project as such: ‘I find it useful to divide the world of people into two classes. There are those who were never ‘let down’ as babies and who are to that extent candidates for the enjoyment of life and of living. There are also those who did suffer traumatic experiences of the kind that result from environmental letdown, and who must carry with them all their lives the memories of the state they were in at moments of disaster. These are candidates for lives of storm and stress and perhaps illness.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was this second category that he wanted to save and spare in the next generation. So what would it take, in his eyes, to encourage the ‘good enough’ parent? Winnicott put forward a number of suggestions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Remember that your child is very vulnerable</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott begins by impressing on his audience how psychologically fragile an infant is. It doesn’t understand itself, it doesn’t know where it is, it is struggling to stay alive, it has no way of grasping when the next feed will come, it can’t communicate with itself or others. It is an undifferentiated, unindividuated mass of competing drives. It isn’t a person. The early months are hence an immense struggle. Winnicott’s work never loses sight of this, and he therefore repeatedly insists that it is those around the infant who have to ‘adapt’, adapt so as to do everything to interpret the child’s needs and not impose demands for which the child is not ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/32277211.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4748" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/32277211.jpg?resize=635%2C486" alt="Royal Family" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A child who has adapted to the world too early, or who has had inappropriate demands made upon it, will be a prime candidate for mental problems, just as health is the result of an environment that can respond appropriately to the child, which can keep elements of reality at bay, until the small creature is ready.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At worse, a depressed mother might prematurely force an infant to be ‘cheerful’, to be together because she was not; a child of very angry, unstable parents might be terrified from expressing any of its darker emotions; or a child of intrusive parents might be prevented from developing a capacity to be alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Let a child be angry</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott knew what violence, what hate there could be in a healthy infant. Referring to what happens if a parent forgets a feed, he cautioned: ‘If you fail him, it must feel to him as if the wild beasts will gobble him up.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But though the infant might sometimes want to kill and destroy, it is vital for the parents to allow rage to expend itself, and for them not in any way to be threatened or moralistic about ‘bad’ behaviour: ‘If a baby cries in a state of rage and feels as if he has destroyed everyone and everything, and yet the people round him remain calm and unhurt, this experience greatly strengthens his ability to see that what he feels to be true is not necessarily real, that fantasy and fact, both important, are nevertheless different from each other.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1164" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76489005.jpg" alt="Youngsters Receive Childhood Immunization" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott interpreted violent feelings against parents as a natural aspect of the maturational process: ‘For a child to be brought up so that he can discover the deepest part of his nature, someone has to be defied, and even at times hated, without there being a danger of a complete break in the relationship.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is why he appreciated and spoke out for difficult adolescents, the sort that scream at their parents and try the odd bit of stealing from their purses. They were proof of children who had been properly loved and could hence dare to defy and test the adult world: ‘A normal child, if he has confidence in mother and father, pulls out all the stops. In the course of time, he tries out his power to disrupt, to destroy, to frighten, to wear down, to waste, to wangle, and to appropriate. Everything that takes people to the courts (or to the asylums for that matter) has its normal equivalent in childhood… If the parents can stand up to all the child can do to disrupt the parents’ world, things will settle down.’ (Winnicott is almost always deeply encouraging in his tone).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4816607591.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4752" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4816607591.jpg?resize=615%2C438" alt="Keep Out sign on child's bedroom door" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Make sure your child isn’t too compliant</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents are delighted when infants and children follow their rules. Such children are called good. Winnicott was very scared of ‘good’ children. He had a messier view of childhood. The point of the early years was to be able to express freely a lot of ‘bad’ feelings without consequences, and without fear of retribution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there might be parents who could not tolerate too much bad behaviour and would demand compliance too early and too strictly. This would lead, in Winnicott’s formulation, to the emergence of a ‘False Self’ – a persona that would be outwardly compliant, outwardly good, but was suppressing its vital instincts; who was not able to properly balance up its social with its destructive sides and that couldn’t be capable of real generosity or love, because it hadn’t been allowed fully to explore selfishness and hate. Only through proper, attentive nurture would a child be able to generate a ‘True Self’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Winnicott’s scheme, adults who can’t be creative, who are somehow a little dead inside, are almost always the children of parents who have not been able to tolerate defiance, parents who have made their offspring ‘good’ way before their time, thereby killing their capacity to be properly good, properly generous and kind (for the compliant personality is in truth only a fake version of a responsible, giving self).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Let your child be</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every failure of the environment forces a child to adapt prematurely. For example, if the parents are too chaotic, the child quickly tries to over-think the situation. Its rational faculties are over-stimulated (it may, in later life, try to be an intellectual).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A parent who is depressed might unwittingly force the child to be too cheerful – giving it no time to process its own melancholy feelings. Winnicott saw the dangers in a child who, in his words, has to ‘look after mother’s mood’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bowl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4750" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bowl.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="Soldier leaving for the First World War, c 1914-1918." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott had a special hatred for ‘people who are always jogging babies up and down on their knees trying to produce a giggle.’ This was merely their way of warding off their own sadness, by demanding laughter from a baby who might have very different things on its mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primordial act of parental health for Winnicott is simply to be able to tune out of oneself for a time in the name of empathising with the ways and needs of a small, mysterious, beautiful fragile person whose unique otherness must be acknowledged and respected in full measure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Realise the gravity of the job you’ve taken on</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the parents Winnicott saw were worn down by their labours. Winnicott tried to bolster them by reminding them of the utmost importance of what they were doing. They were, in their own way, as significant to the nation as the Prime Minister and the Cabinet: ‘The foundation of the health of the human being is laid by you in the baby’s first weeks and months. This thought should help when you feel strange at the temporary loss of your interest in world affairs. It is not surprising. You are engaged in founding the mental health of the next generation.’ Winnicott called parenting: ‘the only real basis for a healthy society, and the only factory for the democratic tendency in a country’s social system.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, there will be errors. Things go wrong in childhood. And that’s what psychoanalysis is for. In Winnicott’s eyes, the analyst in later years acts as a substitute parent, a proxy ‘good enough’ figure who ‘is in a position of the mother of an infant’. Good analysis has things in common with those early years. Here too, the analyst should listen without forcing the patient to get ‘better’ ahead of time. She shouldn’t force a cure down his or her throat, she should provide a safe place where bits of childhood that weren’t completed or went awry can be recreated and rehearsed. Analysis is a chance to fill in the missing steps.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1168" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/151055738.jpg" alt="Psychiatry" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his descriptions of what parents should do for their children, Winnicott was in effect referring to a term which he rarely mentioned directly: love. We often imagine love to be about a magical intuitive ‘connection’ with someone. But, in Winnicott’s writings, we get a different picture. It’s about a surrender of the ego, a putting aside of one’s own needs and assumptions, for the sake of close, attentive listening to another, whose mystery one respects, along with a commitment not to get offended, not to retaliate, when something ‘bad’ emerges, as it often does when one is close to someone, child or adult.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since Winnicott’s death, we’ve collectively grown a little better at parenting. But only a little. We may spend more time with our children, we know in theory that they matter a lot, but we’re arguably still failing at the part Winnicott focused on: adaptation. We still routinely fail to suppress our own needs or stifle our own demands when we’re with a child. We’re still learning how to love our children – and that, Winnicott would argue, is why the world is still full of the walking-wounded, people of outward ‘success’ and respectability who are nevertheless not quite ‘real’ inside and inflict their wounds on others. We’ve a way to go until we get to be ‘good enough.’ It’s a task – Winnicott would have insisted – that’s in its own way as important as curing malaria or slowing global warming.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Among our deepest and seemingly most natural aspirations is the longing to form stable, satisfying relationships: to thrive in partnerships that are good for both people. It doesn’t seem much to ask. A lot of people are looking for roughly the same thing. But the painful fact is that very large numbers of relationships have one difficult episode after another, or seemingly intractable miserable conflicts running through them; relationships feel like a struggle, rather than a support. It’s one of the biggest questions: why is it so hard for us to have the happy, constructive relationships we all want?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The huge – and not yet fully digested – insight of psychoanalysis is that the challenges of relationships do not start over dinner in an interesting restaurant or a college bar. They start, in fact, when we are children. There is no more important period of our lives than childhood; a good childhood is the bedrock of a happy life and a bad one just about dooms us to enduring misery. It was the contribution of the great psychoanalyst John Bowlby to trace the tensions and conflicts we have with our partners back to our early experience of maternal care. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bowlby2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4754" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/bowlby2.jpg?resize=635%2C580" alt="bowlby2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His ideas are sound in part because he drew so deeply and honestly on his own experiences in order to formulate them. Born in 1907, Edward John Mostyn Bowlby had a quintessentially upper class British childhood. His father was a famous and highly successful doctor, with a knighthood and royal connections. Young Bowlby hardly saw his parents and was looked after by a lovely nanny, Minnie. But Minnie was an employee, and when John was four, she was sent away. His parents weren’t being deliberately callous. They (like pretty much everyone else at the time) didn’t realise how wounding her departure could be. At seven, Bowlby went off – in line with the conventions of his class – to boarding school, to a realm from which maternal warmth was rigorously excluded. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bowlby was a brilliant medical student and an imaginative researcher. In 1952 he made a film, <em>A Two-Year-Old Goes to Hospital</em>, which showed the suffering a child went through when they were institutionally separated from their parents. In the wards mothers were not allowed to hold their sick children, for instance, for fear of spreading germs. Visiting times were punitively restricted.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Two__year_old_goes_to_hospital600.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9171" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Two__year_old_goes_to_hospital600.jpg?resize=635%2C494" alt="A_Two__year_old_goes_to_hospital600" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he was a consultant to the World Health Organisation in the early 1950s, Bowlby wrote a report, ‘Maternal Care and Mental Health’. He attacked prevalent assumptions (including those vigorously maintained by his own mother), arguing that kindness does not smother and spoil children. And he asserted the importance to both child and mother of developing an intimate and enjoyable relationship. This initiated a wave of reform: the visitation rules of many health institutions were reformed – a dry, bureaucratic move that ended countless afternoons of quiet sorrow and evenings of solitary anguish. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bowlby poignantly invokes loving care that a little boy needs: ‘all the cuddling and playing, the intimacies of suckling by which a child learns the comfort of his mother’s body, the rituals of washing and dressing by which through her pride and tenderness towards his little limbs he learns the values of his own…’ Such experiences teach a basic trust: that difficulties can be managed; that slip-ups are only that and can be put right, that we are naturally entitled to be treated warmly and considerately, without having to do anything to earn this and without having to make special pleas or demands. ‘’It is as if maternal care were as necessary for the proper development of personality as vitamin D for the proper development of bones.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal parent is there when child needs it. They are good at actually listening to what the child is saying. They help the child work out for itself what it is feeling. The ideal parent is not anxiously hanging around trying to micromanage everything. The ideal parent makes it feel that problems, difficulties and dangers don’t always have to be avoided: they can be coped with, solved or skillfully overcome. Such a parent makes the child secure. Not just that the child feels secure at particular moments but that they take this security with them into the tasks of life: they become secure people, so that they are less urgently in need of external validation, less devastated by failure, less in need of markers of status to reassure themselves of their own worth – because they carry within them a stable, reasonable, secure sense of who they are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15155101189_46198924c7_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9175" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/15155101189_46198924c7_b.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="15155101189_46198924c7_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the fact is that we often don’t quite get the maternal care we need. Parents – without meaning to let anyone down – go wrong in endless ways. They are inconsistent: at one point they are hugely available, happy to play and do things; then suddenly they are sternly busy and remote. Or they might be sweet and tender – but equally they might be angry or grumpy. They are around, then they disappear. They might be busy almost all the time, or very much preoccupied by work or social life. Their own fears, anxieties or troubles may keep them from providing the wise, generous attention the child needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a book published in 1959 called<em> Separation Anxiety</em> Bowlby looks at what happens when there isn’t enough maternal care. He described the behaviour of children he had observed who had been separated from their parents. They went through three stages: protest, despair and detachment. The first phase began as soon as the parent left, and it would last between a few hours and a week. Protesting children would cry, roll around and react to any movement as the possibility of their mother returning. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If something like this is frequently experienced, then the child craves the attention, love and interest of the parents but feels that anything good may disappear at any moment. They look for a lot of reassurance – and get upset if it is not forthcoming. They are volatile: they take heart, then they despair, then they are filled with hope again. This is the pattern of what Bowlby called ‘anxious attachment’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/79491416_7eaacaf413_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9173" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/79491416_7eaacaf413_z.jpg?resize=635%2C610" alt="79491416_7eaacaf413_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the degree of separation from the parents may be greater. the child could feel so helpless, they become detached: they enter their own world. To protect themselves they become remote and cold. They are, Bowlby says, ‘attachment avoidant’: that is, they see tenderness, closeness, emotional investment as dangerous and to be shunned. They may, in truth, be desperate for a cuddle or for reassurance, but such things look far too treacherous. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The focus of Bowlby’s thinking was about what happens to a child if there are too many difficulties in forming secure attachments. But the consequences don’t magically get restricted only to the age of 8 or 12 or 17. They are life long. The pattern of relating that we develop in childhood gets deployed in our adult lives.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our attachment style is fed by early experiences: it defines our individual way of being with others. It’s how we sense what other people are up to, how we frame our own needs, how we expect things to go. It’s a pre-existing script that gets written into our adult relationships – usually without us even realising that this happens. It all feels obvious and familiar (even when it is uncomfortable). We take this with us, from partner to partner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In line with Bowlby’s views about how children relate to their parents, there are three basic kinds of attachment we have to other adults. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Secure attachment</strong> is the (rare) ideal. If there is a problem, you work it out. You are not appalled by the weakness of your partner. You can take it in your stride, because you can look after yourself when you have to. So if your partner is a bit down, confused or just plain annoying, you don’t have to react too wildly. Because even if they can’t be nice to you, you can take care of yourself and have, hopefully, a little left over to meet some of the needs of your partner. You give the other the benefit of the doubt when interpreting behaviour. You realise that maybe they were just busy, when they didn’t show any interest in your new haircut, or insights into the news. Maybe they had a tricky time at work, that’s why they are not interested in your day. The explanations are accommodating, generous – and usually more accurate. You are slow to anger, quick to forgive and forget. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6498151289_1eb8373f41_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9177" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6498151289_1eb8373f41_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="6498151289_1eb8373f41_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Anxious attachment</strong> is marked by clinginess: calling just to check where the other is and keeping tabs on what they are up to. You need to make sure that they haven’t left you – or the country. Anxious attachment involves a lot of anger because the stakes feel very high. A minor slight, a hasty word, a tiny oversight can look – to the very anxious person – like huge threats. They seem to announce the imminent breakup of the whole relationship. Anxiously attached people quickly become coercive and demanding and focus on their own needs – not their partner’s. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Avoidant attachment</strong> means that you would rather withdraw, and go away, than get angry with or admit you need the other person. If there is a problem, you don’t talk. Your instinct is to say you don’t really like the other person who has hurt you. Avoidant spouses often team up with anxious ones. It’s a risky combination. The avoidant one doesn’t give the anxious one much support. And the anxious one is always invading the delicate privacy of the avoidant one. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bowlby helps us towards more generous – and more constructive – ways of seeing what our partners are doing, when they upset or disappoint us. Almost no one in truth is purely anxious or avoidant. They are just a bit like that, some of the time. So, alerted by Bowlby, we can see that a partner’s apparent coldness and indifference is not caused by their loathing of us, but by the fact that a long time ago they were too badly hurt by intimacy. They are protecting themselves out of fear. They deserve compassion, not a character assassination. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And it opens possibilities of self-knowledge which can help one reform (if only a little) one’s own behaviour. Perhaps I work so hard because I can’t trust anyone and because a long time ago, I felt that work might help me to secure the fleeting unreliable love of my parents. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bowlby died in September 1990 in his early eighties, at his summer home on the Island of Skye.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a powerful, modest but very real principle of hope at work in his theories. It took a long time for Bowlby’s ideas about the importance of the early bond between the mother and child to get broader recognition and support. But it did happen, eventually. There was no single dramatic revolutionary moment. Many thousands of people changed their minds in small ways: an idea that sounded stupid, came to seem mildly interesting. The slow revolution took place at dinner tables and at school gates, at conferences in out of the way places and in careful cost-benefit analyses worked out by civil servants. It is a process of social evolution in which there are few obvious heroes and many necessary participants who can never know exactly what contribution they made: so that today a child facing a frightening operation is surrounded by love and kindness and her parents get to sleep in a bed beside her.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How long it took in history for this need to be taken seriously – and so touching it should have been by this particular man, whose family background, childhood, and education could have been expected to close off any such sympathetic insights.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Research shows that in the UK population:</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">56 per cent are securely attached</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">24 per cent are avoidantly attached</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">20 per cent are anxiously attached</span></em></p>
