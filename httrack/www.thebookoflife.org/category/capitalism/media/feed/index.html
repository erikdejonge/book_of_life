<p>We are likely to have grown up thinking that the mainstream media was our friend. The common sense, natural judge of everything that matters and is important and a reliable guide to existence. So why, after spending so long with it, are we generally so overloaded, confused and oddly unfocused on the stuff that really matters?</p>

<p>Over the past century, technologies have completely changed the way we connect with each other. The benefits of the internet are obvious and all around us. But the risks and dangers are more subterranean. Here are two videos that consider why we need to start taking digital sabbaths and remember what it is to be bored again:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We believe in censorship. Sometimes. Of course, that’s a very unpopular view these days; censorship looks small-minded, defensive and the enemy of a hard-won freedom to express oneself without interference. People associate censorship with book burning, political repression and ignorant intolerance. The heroic events which ended censorship in Europe seem only to bear this out. For instance, the censorship of Diderot’s Encyclopedia in 1752 was a petty attack by the Church on a sophisticated and deeply useful intellectual project. The ban on D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover was a comparably idiotic step. When the publishers, Penguin, were tried in 1960 under the Obscene Publications Act, the prosecution appeared dowdy and dim, while the defence was passionate and intelligent. In the history of censorship, it always seems as if it is something of real value – profound, earnest and true – that is condemned and someone vile, corrupt and absurd who is trying to do the censoring.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3773" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipA.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="Risque Reading" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Censors as fools: the Chatterley ban</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But maybe that’s no longer always true. Maybe, just maybe, that phase of history (in which the censored were always good and the censors always bad) has, in the developed countries at least, passed in many ways. The real threat nowadays is perhaps not that wonderful truths are in danger of being repressed by malign authorities but rather that we will drown in chaos produced by aggressive and uncontrolled commercial interests, that we will be overwhelmed by irrelevant, greedy, noxious and unhelpful trivia, and that we will be left unable to concentrate on what is genuinely important and good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3774" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipB.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The FSA's Martin Wheatley Delivers His Report Into LIBOR Reforms" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freedom of expression or just a pain?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A key argument of those who attack ‘censorship’ today is to claim that we all need to hear all the messages all the time. But do we? Do we, for example, need to hear a message about what kind of scent it would be nice to buy when walking past the riverbank in central Paris?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipC1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4221" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipC1.jpg?resize=635%2C364" alt="PM-200314-censorshipC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Perfume advertisement on the facade of the Musee D’Orsay, Paris, 2011</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Chanel advert is depressing to the human spirit because it enacts on a large scale, in a conspicuous and prestigious place, a weakness that we know we need to overcome in ourselves: our tendency to escape into distraction, narcissism and useless consumption. The advertisement unintentionally supports our worst sides.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The argument here is that things that draw us away from our true potential should not be paraded in front of us, asking for admiration, at every occasion (on the bus, on the back of the airplane seat, in the street…). In the case of the Musee d’Orsay, censorship would mean taking care that the public environment reflected, and thus comforted and supported, our better natures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censoring an incongruous billboard on the side of a much loved building may not be too controversial. But such an example reveals underlying principles which can be put to further use. Unhelpful messages can be targeted in a number of areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/176633845.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5154" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/176633845.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Real Housewives of New Jersey - Season 5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We know humans can get like this: but does it help us to see them too easily?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take TV, for instance. Television broadcasts have long been censored on grounds of violence and sexuality – and there is widespread agreement that this is an acceptable, and even welcome, restriction on liberty. We know perfectly well that images of an extreme kind are readily available elsewhere if one really wants to go and hunt for them; but an important distinction exists between what people do completely in private and what is acceptable more or less ‘in public’ over the airwaves. But the insight which leads us to censor images because they are too graphic or gory actually applies more broadly than these two usual categories. For the problem is not primarily to do with sex or violence; the real concern is that some scenes that are paraded before us are humiliating to our collective dignity. They give us a shameful view of human nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censorship is not necessarily about making it impossible to view such material. What it does insist on is the private and personal character of the interest: it refuses public endorsement. The most sinister programmes and adverts are those that are confident about their own merits, when they are in fact spectacularly unworthy of regard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a democratic, market-oriented society, public culture is hugely important. It guides our collective ideas about what is admirable or shocking, what counts as normal or weird. It generates a shared perception of status. All public things shape our individual lives, and they make their way into politics and the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censoring the odd message deserves to be considered not always as an unenlightened suppression of crucial ideas, but occasionally as a sincere attempt to organise the world for human flourishing.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cate Blanchett is on a roll, winning multiple prizes of late, and she’s been nominated for an Oscar too. But she’s been doing something even more impressive than looking stylish and getting tearful on the winner’s podium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s been taking her son Roman, 9, along to the ceremonies. At the recent Golden Globes, the boy looked endearing, impish, well-behaved and curious, and she seemed to be paying him lots of attention (at one point tenderly ordering him an orange juice when a waiter had set down some sparkling water next to him), even though there were plenty of other demands on her time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4225" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettB1.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Cate Blanchett and her 3 sons out for a walk in Manhattan." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we respond so positively?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to get cynical about this. Isn’t she only doing this to make us like her? But there’s another prior and more interesting question hovering in the wings: why would we like her more simply because she was nice to her kids? Why is it so heartwarming to see a celebrity or a politician being kind to a small person?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has to do with some of our deepest anxieties around inequality. Cate Blanchett is a hugely powerful actress. She has earnt $45million. She commands $5 million a film and a few years back, won a contract to promote Giorgio Armani’s new fragrance, ‘Si’, for $10million. At an award ceremony, Cate’s entrance turns heads. Everyone wants to talk to her. She could humiliate you with a dismissive look. But by bringing along her son to an event (she could very easily have found a babysitter), she’s sending out a signal: she’s reminding herself and, importantly, us of her humanity. Blanchett’s sons certainly won’t care much for their mother’s worldly self. They judge her by a different register. They care whether she helps them with the Lego City firestation, or plays the game with the pillows and the duvet. They tell her frankly that her films are so boring (they didn’t last ten minutes through ‘Blue Jasmine’). And when she patiently explains it’s bed-time or that they can’t have any more ice-cream, they complain that she’s a stupid poo-face. A bit like a court-jester in the Middle-Ages, children play a vital role in the lives of the powerful: they keep them sane by refusing to take them seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cate wouldn’t turn dismissively on her heels because one of her sons wasn’t impressed by her taste in fashion. And she’d be understanding, and more than ready to make a joke, if Roman burped during her speech. Powerful parents love their children even though they have no power, status or money – which is extremely cheering news for most of us, who are in rather short supply in these areas as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children hence function as a bridge between power and humanity in societies that are oppressively, scarily hierarchical. They provide an opportunity – in our age, the single greatest opportunity – for the powerful to rehearse their capacities for kindness, without looking weak, half-witted or slightly unhinged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3747" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettC.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="PM-310114-blanchettC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Without the child he’s just a guy with launch codes sprinting strangely indoors</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When powerful people are gentle with children (usually their own), they reassure us that they understand vulnerability and know how to be sweet towards weakness. Their ease meets our fears. After seeing him on an impromptu play-date, we can take comfort in the idea that President Obama won’t ever curtly say to a restless child keen for a run-around: ‘Shape up or ship out’. And that signals that he probably wouldn’t do the same to us either, even if we’re not three feet high or eager to chase him round the Resolute desk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Renaissance, when the Catholic church went on a drive to boost the profile of Mary, it cottoned on to a crucial move. The best way to suggest that Mary was a nice person was to demonstrate that she knew how to be kind to her child, because this would also imply that she could be kind to everyone who needed her, young and old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4227" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettD1.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="PM-310114-blanchettD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mother to the child-like parts of all of us</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shameful secret of adult life is that it’s not just children who are child-like. We are all intermittently hysterical, terrified, pitiful and in dire need of consolation and forgiveness. Without bearing grudges, adults tend to be nice to children even when they’re not at their best. Around children, we know how to offer a generosity of interpretation, and a sensitive recalibration of our expectations. No-one thinks a six year old is an idiot because she can’t do long-division; we just accept that it will take a bit of time for her to learn. When children get ill-tempered in the car, we don’t think they have it in for us; we recognise boredom makes people slightly desperate. We’re that bit slower to anger; that bit more alive to potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all deserve more of this kind of attention – but we don’t generally get it. We readily offer children the sort of kindness that we are woefully reluctant to offer one another. We want a world where people are nice to their own children. But even more than that, what we want is a world where people are nice to the childlike parts of other people, including people who aren’t their children, and most of all, nice to those slightly shameful, deeply human and childlike parts of us.</span></p>

She was walking through the popular tourist attraction with two friends when she was suddenly struck. The friends of the 31-year-old described hearing a loud “crack” before realising a branch was falling. Despite paramedics battling to save her, she was pronounced dead at the scene. It would have been such a nice day out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why do we care about such stories? For centuries in Europe, artists were trained to produce ‘memento mori’, works of art that would remind their viewers of death. They usually featured a skull and an hourglass.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310314-treeB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4232" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310314-treeB1.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="PM-310314-treeB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The point of these works wasn’t to make people despair, just to focus on what really matters</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Horrific accidents could serve a similar refocusing function. Most of what upsets us from day to day is disconnected from what ultimately gives our life its meaning – and yet these stresses absorb our energies with vicious intensity nevertheless. Vivid reminders of mortality put our prosaic obsessions into question. When measured against our limited time spans, the true insignificance of some of our concerns is emphasised and our narcissistic, frivolous tendencies can cede to our more sincere and purposeful sides.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News of sudden accidents in parks humbles us into acknowledging that, if life is as fragile as this, if we really have no guarantee that there are decades left ahead, then we don’t want to be people who spent an afternoon arguing with a beloved, who refused to forgive a friend for a minor transgression or who neglected a genuine talent in favour of an unhappy sinecure. The thought of death has the power to rearrange our priorities, returning to the surface the more valuable parts of us which have a tendency to get submerged in the everyday struggles. Evidence of what there is really to fear has the chance to scare us into leading our lives as we know, in the core of our being, that we properly should.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news offers us the opportunity to use its grim stories as our own, modern version of ‘memento mori’. Horrific accidents should cease to be merely records of private pain. They should help us to embark upon the far more important task of living in accordance with our true talents and interests in whatever precious moments we may have left before a falling tree branch calls time on us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We like it, though we might not always admit that we do, when a celebrity falls from grace. Yesterday they were on the red carpet, everyone was their friend. Now they are in a humiliating divorce; or they are up on drugs charges; or maybe they’ve been caught trying to punch an employee . They had what looked like such a great life; now it’s all falling apart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/conversationsabouther.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jeremy-Clarkson-014.jpg?resize=611%2C367" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It can seem pretty squalid to enjoy this kind of news. How evil must we be to actually take pleasure in seeing someone go through hell in public. But perhaps something rather different, and a lot more to our credit, is going on. We are mesmerized because we crave intimacy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you really are close to someone it’s not only their good sides you see; you get to know them more deeply. You see their sufferings, you are there when things go wrong. Part of what constitutes a close friendship is acquaintance with the dark stuff: you know all about the terrible divorce; the drinking bouts and the insecurities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But mostly this doesn’t happen. Mostly we only ever encounter the edited, airbrushed surface of public figures. We say we like strength and admire success. We do, but weakness and failure makes us more connected to the people we like.</span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4379358632_a6c982aa78_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9725" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4379358632_a6c982aa78_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4379358632_a6c982aa78_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p2">It can be easier to feel closer to someone – when things aren’t going so well for them</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weird though it sounds at first, people become more likeable when we know their flaws. They seem more like us. We’re routinely terrified that if people knew what we are really like they’d ditch us. If they knew what we’re like when we’re in a rage, or drunk or depressed or when we lash out verbally at someone, they’d think we were monsters. Yet the truth is, because we are all like this to some extent, it is actually reassuring, even nice, to hear about the messes in the lives of others. It’s not cruelty that takes us there, but the need to know that we are normal, that our own troubles are not a unique curse, but that similar things happen even to people who – on the surface – have all the things we lack.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the background, with a lot of celebrities, we can sense a huge effort to be perfect. If only they can cook better than anyone, if only they can act in the most successful films, if only they can make a fortune, then people will – at last – like them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, paradoxically, the celebrity who tried and failed may actually be more likeable. They are doing something more important than they ever could through being perfect. They are rehearsing in public something we all need to do: learn, somehow, to live with our awful flaws, our vulnerability, and our secret patheticness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we only ever see models of poise and accomplishment, we end up with a very strange relationship to ourselves. We start to think that our own muddled, troubled selves are not acceptable and are abnormal in terrifying ways. The limited information we get about other people usually encourages that distorted picture. So it is a great relief – genuinely heartening and welcome – to be shown that it’s normal to be messed up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we take pleasure in reading these stories we shouldn’t be ashamed of ourselves. We are circling round something important, though not quite closing in on it as yet. It’s not that we need to stop, we just need to do it better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The pact with disgrace should go two ways. We benefit from their public humiliation; so we should reciprocate and extend to them the compassion we so desperately want others to give us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Yuan Zhouming makes a meagre living polishing people’s shoes twelve hours a day on the streets of Wenzhou, a large city in south-east China. His wife ran off a few years ago, so he takes his four-year-old son around with him while he’s working. The little boy used to beg for food, dart into the road, and sometimes try to steal things from passers by. So the father has taken to tethering him with a rope to keep him out of mischief. He lives his childhood on a tiny patch of pavement. It’s not cruelty, it’s desperation. The father just can’t do his job and keep an eye on Yuan Wang at the same time. At night, they go home to a single squalid basement room. The boy has a teddy bear – his one comfort.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2841" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artA.jpg" alt="Poor single father's struggle to bring up his young son, Wenzhou, China - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Theoretically, we know quite well that there is something called poverty in China. And we realise that many children in all countries have hard lives. But if we’re honest we have to admit that mostly we’re not moved by these abstract facts. We don’t really take it in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2842" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artB.jpg" alt="Poor single father's struggle to bring up his young son, Wenzhou, China - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© HAP/Quirky China News/REX</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">News is always running into this difficulty. Unemployment in Greece is 28%. The average wage in China is $7,890 US per annum. There were 300,000 car thefts in France last year. 28% of boys in the UK aged between 8 and 16 say they enjoy reading – compared with 62% of girls. The prestige of data is fed by the tempting but false idea that ‘knowing the facts’ is what matters. Abstract statistics look clever and serious. But so often they just wash over us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The chained boy and his shoe-shine father take us in the opposite direction. We are creatures designed for intimate contact, for local lives and personal relationships. For ideas to become powerful in our souls, they need to be anchored in experience. We need to feel them, see them. This is what art, at its best, lasers in on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2843" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artC.jpg" alt="Poor single father's struggle to bring up his young son, Wenzhou, China - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1816, French newspapers reported that a naval frigate, the Méduse, had run aground off the coast of Africa, with the loss of 133 lives. Only a few survivors made it, clinging desperately to a raft for many days. It could have just become one more tiny forgettable item in the vast catalogue of maritime disasters. But the great French painter, Gericault, made it live in the imagination of humanity for ever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In just the same way, thanks to the art of documentary photography, the story of Yuan Wang and his father has the chance to become more than a dull statistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2844" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artD.jpg" alt="PM-200214-artD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You would have been unlikely to think of the story for more than a second – until it became a work of art.</span></p>
<p class="p2">News organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information – assuming that if the information is significant, it will go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We merely get bored and turn away when they’re heaped in front of us. In order to matter to us, news has to become skilled at entering our imaginations: it has to accept the resounding truth that bare information isn’t sufficient. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Media organisations want us to care about the bad stuff that is happening out there – and the best way they feel they can do this is to tell us about the gore, the bombs, the landslides, the murders and the calamities.</p>
<p class="p2">In the media’s coverage of global events, the focus is relentlessly on the shocking and the bloody. It’s a strategy that sees complacency as the obstacle to progress. People don’t realise how bad it is out there. If they knew, they’d act.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2879" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/157044107-1.jpg" alt="SYRIA-CONFLICT" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this involves a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychology: when a troubled bit of the earth is seen as deeply awful, news of outrage and horror make little impact. It confirms the bleak belief that the region is beyond all reason and redemption already.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is in part what makes the photographs of Tanya Habjouqa so striking – and so shocking, because rather than showing us hackneyed imagery reducing Palestinians to either proponents or victims of violence in the West Bank and Gaza, she has trained her lens on very different things. She has looked at what is fun, charming, sweet and deeply normal in one of the most troubled regions on earth – the kind of stuff we know intimately and intuitively from our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2881" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TANYA_0002.jpg" alt="TANYA_0002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What every 12-year-old does in pools around the world: they see how long they can float and hold their breath for. Ain Farah, West Bank</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, we know that ordinary things continue in places associated with terror, hatred and intractable conflict. But the media generally only shows us things that make lives there different. Countries disappear into their worst moments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank become suicide bombers and tanks; virulent extremists and wailing mothers. And so we stop caring, which has serious policy implications. Widespread indifference makes diplomatic disengagement inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The route to caring about the extraordinary is through the ordinary. We need to feel close to the ordinary moments of others’ lives before we can care about what happens to them in their tragedies. This is a brute fact about the mechanics of sympathy which the media has forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2882" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TANYA_0011.jpg" alt="TANYA_0011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Girls from Ramallah, trying on dresses for an upcoming school dance</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If these girls were in Essex or Hamburg, it would be merely another night out. Here it becomes an achievement. It radiates hope. The people doing the bombing suddenly seem shallow by comparison. Why don’t they care about the things that actually matter to people and the real pleasures of existence? It’s moving and reassuring that the attractions of dancing and high heels are not going to be extinguished, for they are astonishingly resilient, much harder to get rid of than fear and prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2883" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Occupied-Pleasures-by-Tanya-Habjouqa_31-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682" alt="A toy store van drives along Gaza's beach high way." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The power of normality. Sponge Bob might not seem impressive in a shopping centre in Manchester or Lyon. But it becomes moving to imagine a child coveting a SquarePants doll or the parents organising a themed party – in the Gaza strip</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels paradoxical, but if we don’t see people as sharing our concerns, our pity will be abstract and insubstantial, easily put aside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2884" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6-ladies-who-rally-photograph-series-by-tanya-habjouqa.jpg" alt="6-ladies-who-rally-photograph-series-by-tanya-habjouqa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Women who rally in the West Bank. Like the women in Nashville. Like your cousin. Like your best friend’s sister. The driver loves Top Gear. She can’t be denied basic rights. She is why diplomacy matters intensely</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to retrain our war photographers to show us not just the horror, but also – as importantly – the everyday. Currently, despite the media’s amazing technological capabilities, despite the bureaux, correspondents, photographers and camera operators, we are given no information whatsoever about ordinary occurrences. We don’t know whether anyone has ever had a normal day in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for no such thing has ever been recorded by a Western news organisation. We have no idea what it’s like to go to school or visit the hairdresser in Bolivia; it’s entirely mysterious whether anything like a good marriage is possible in Somalia; and we are equally in the dark about office life in Turkmenistan and what people do on the weekend in Algeria.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That should change. The ideal news organisation of the future, recognising that an interest in the anomalous depends on a prior knowledge of the normal, would tell us about street parties in Addis Ababa, love in Peru, in-laws in Mongolia and rally-driving in Nablus, so that audiences would be prepared to care just a little more about the next devastating typhoon, violent coup and appalling cluster bomb.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In their more serious moods, news organisations tell us they want to explain the world to us. And that often means talking about money.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s certainly a lot of information about money in the news: our eyes are regularly directed towards a variety of key indicators on the economic dashboard, including the money supply (M1, M2, MZM), central bank reserves, factory orders, the consumer price index (CPI), building permits, jobless claims, the deficit, the national debt and, most significantly of all, the GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2897" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chart5.gif" alt="Chart5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The complexity of the financial machine soon shuts most of us up. Only a tiny percentage of us have any real understanding of the workings of the economic system we exist within. This isn’t a coincidence. We’re badly educated more or less on purpose. It’s a strategy to keep us quiet. Conveniently, most of us will constantly struggle to grasp quite what might be going on within essential terms like arbitrage, Basel 1 and 2, cyclically adjusted current budgets, price/earnings ratios or quantitative easing. As we follow financial events in the news, we ask, in utter confusion: what is the growth rate of money? How do hedge funds operate? What does the LIBOR rate determine? What is liquidity? How does inflation targeting work? How can a government ‘print money’ and what are the long-term consequences? Why are some people rich and others poor?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those kindly commentators occasionally employed by news organisations to help us with our confusions certainly try hard to offer us explanations, but their explanations have a habit of leaching from our minds just hours after we have heard them. But even if we don’t understand much, sometimes we still wonder whether things are arranged as they should be. Lying awake at night, for instance, some of us may wonder, in a sincere and yet inarticulate way, why it is that the world built by capitalism is not (bathos intended) nicer. Why is there still so much suffering all around? Why do some have so much and others so little? Why are most jobs mindless? Why can’t there be more security and leisure? Why do anxiety and fear persist almost everywhere? Aren’t we destroying the planet for no particular reason or reward? (By this time it may be getting very late, and only a stubborn few will continue to press on..) Couldn’t we start again in some new way, rejig things, perhaps pass some laws and experiment with bold new ideas in order to create a freer, less anxious, happier world?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2898" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/natural.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Blend Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are made to understand – in a variety of subtle ways – that these aren’t serious questions (growing up means being made very aware of the dangers of being idealistic or even worse ‘naive’); these are the sorts of questions that fourteen-year-olds write poems about or argue with their parents over. In the morning, we’ll put them firmly away. They don’t belong to the standard narrative of economics in the news. We may blanch to think of what any properly intelligent and sensible person might make of them – someone like, say, the chair of the Federal Reserve, the most powerful economist in the world today.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But our questions only seem immature because we have a false image of maturity. We associate maturity with a sober acceptance of a great many things that we should refuse to accept. Standard economic news is mostly a story of pain, teaching us a lot of complicated but sound reasons why a great many nice things aren’t possible: why we can’t wave a magic wand and make poor countries rich; why competition and therefore anxiety are necessary in a market economy; why total job security makes people lazy; why a country has to reward its winners and punish its losers; why rich people can’t be proportionately taxed; why we can’t all live more simply yet still with dignity; why governments can’t limit the free market in the name of higher values; why inane consumer goods are an indispensable part of a flourishing economy; why it’s good for growth if people don’t generally share and recycle their belongings and why we can’t afford too intense a concern for making the world beautiful and clean.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So we end up with a news agenda dominated by reports of the workings of a highly complicated social science that wrestles with problems of near cosmic scale and incomprehensible difficulty, upon which it periodically delivers pronouncements at once pessimistic and resigned – and on the other hand, we have a host of naive, innocent, impassioned but powerful longings that are carefully concealed and mostly go unmentioned for fear of sacrificing claims to decency and adult seriousness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally, the tensions get too much and there are explosions. A group of people collectively declare that they’ve had enough, paint some placards, buy megaphones and take their positions outside the central bank, the fast food concession or the oil company headquarters. A few weeks later, after some moments of exuberance and struggles with heavy-handed police, the makeshift camps are hosed down and the news moves on.</span></p>

<h6 class="p2">© Bebeto Matthews/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These explosions are undermined by a fatal naivety, that is, by a set of the best possible intentions to improve a problematic situation – combined with a lack of any effective or forensic knowledge about what has caused it in the first place. A complaint that might have occasioned an intricate political argument instead ends up as a primal scream.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is partly to blame for this incoherent rage; it is the news that helps to raise audiences that cannot make sense of and feel hopeless about their condition and that are fed a diet of economic analyses that skilfully crushes ambitious considerations of how to create a more equitable world. The protesters rightly recognise that there are things wrong with the economic system – but they find it hard to zero in on the specifics of the difficulties. It would take concentrated periods of guided interrogation and study to understand the mechanics of the financial machine – as well as to lay a skilful finger on the realistic options for its reform. Tantalisingly, there are a great many very sensible options out there – which, non-coincidentally, we never hear about in the news for very long.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most news is uninclined to provide a proper economic education equipped with a robust political dimension, either because it is itself confused and distracted about, or benefits from, status quo. It isn’t the task or within the power of news to solve all economic conundrums by itself. Its power is more secondary, and yet still it is considerable: the news has the ability to define the agenda, by leading the attention of an audience to what it believes to be the issues of importance and then to deliver an interested and knowledgeable constituency to governments and corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At present, mainstream news organisations chiefly track the day-to-day activities within the economic establishment. They tell us what is going on, but not with any conviction of what might or should happen. In so far as the news creates an agenda, it is a limited one: whether one should intervene to bolster the labour market or not, leave or join the currency union, remain strict about inflation or be less vigilant. The economic ‘debate’ as it is seen through the lens of the news does not stray beyond tightly-defined lines which restrict both an audience’s expectations and its sense of what might be possible. Depart from the agenda (ask about reconceiving what a shareholder is and should be, for example, or question assumptions about growth and well-being), and with bewildering speed, one ends up in territory deemed ‘radical’ and therefore, ridiculous – even if most of what we now take for granted (a minimum wage, child protection, environmental legislation) started off by seeming entirely radical, if not insane, to ‘sensible’ opinion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2902" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_805674a.jpg" alt="Evening Standard newspaper headline on the credit crunch,  London, Britain - 09 Oct 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Ray Tang</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A perfect news service would analyse current events, but also convey a bold sense of the economic principles that would ideally underpin society. It would be guided by a sense of where one should be going, operating with an economic utopia in mind, a community both prosperous and civilised, concerned as much with money as with its proper ends: fulfilment, fairness, generosity, beauty and kindness. It would be doctrinaire only about the destination, while remaining empirically flexible about the means of getting there – unlike right and left wing analyses that grow brittle and tiring through their axiomatic support of predictable means.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While continuing its regular routine of analysing derivatives, yield ratios and the state of M2 money supply, economic news should not forget its ultimate responsibility to a larger quest for a world capable of sustaining less anxious and ruinous, more secure and more meaningful working lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such an agenda, however fey it sounds within the context of classical economics, is at this point in our history too significant to be stumblingly raised only in private in the middle of the night or else shouted in a hoarse voice from a megaphone seconds before a police charge.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week the Dow Jones Industrial Average started on Monday at 16,162.70 and rose and fell each day. It surged on Friday towards 16,400 but fell back to close at 16,321.71. It was not an all-time high (a few weeks ago it peaked at 17,576.66). Still, the long term trend is definitely upwards.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Dow, which is the world’s most prestigious financial index, takes a daily temperature reading of the US, assigning it an astonishingly precise number. Behind this lies an almost unimaginable complexity of human behaviour: deals were made and broken off, sales teams in Mexico reported above average orders for catering equipment, slightly fewer bicycles than expected were bought in New Zealand, predictions were made for the future demand for copper in India and the state of negotiations in Syria was scrutinised, Putin’s attitude to the Ukraine was speculated upon, millions of meetings took place. All this activity, hope, anxiety and thought is summed up in a single figure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2819" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesA.jpg" alt="PM-060314-dowjonesA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to treat such numbers with a high degree of reverence. They seem to be telling us something of immense importance. They hint at an answer to the great question of existence: are things going well or badly, is the world doing OK? How is life on earth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really worth asking such questions and reflecting heavily upon them. This is what philosophers traditionally like to do.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2820" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesB.jpg" alt="Japan Toyota" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sales of Japanese cars are stagnant in Brazil – the Dow noticed on Wednesday and made a correction</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the numbers do not actually answer our question, for the links between the Dow Jones figures and what is actually going on in our lives (their rise or fall) is vague. It’s not that there is no connection whatsoever. The financial health of major US companies does have indirect, distant links to the economic side of everyone’s life. Yet the quality and character of daily life is powerfully affected by a great many things which the financial data does not recognise, for example, your health, the view from your window, the quality of your relationship, the state of your ambitions, your degree of envy, how your kids are doing. These may, indeed, be rather more important in determining ‘how things are going’ than the Dow Index. But the Dow doesn’t entirely admit this. It seems to be making a larger claim: to know how your life is going – and it brings to this claim a panoply of impressive arrows, charts and incomprehensible acronyms which cow us into believing in its authority, rather as our ancestors might have trusted in the confused mumblings of a priest sitting on top of an altar in a darkened temple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2821" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesC.jpg" alt="New Bank of England Governor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">Teenage angst numbers under review</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all our expertise, we have not yet learned how to devise reliable indicators of the state of nations and individuals. We do not have a daily set of figures to record what truly matters. It might help, for example, to know the incidence of unnecessary embarrassment or whether arrogance is becoming 0.1% more or less common. We don’t have figures measuring supplies of patience, tact and forbearance. We don’t have indices around envy, infidelity and fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of these vital indicators, we cling to the signals offered to us by Wall Street. We use words like depression and exuberance, terms well known from personal life, to describe the movements of stocks and shares.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To ask for better indices of national well being sounds whimsical. Yet it ought not to, for we need data that homes in on things that matter greatly for what our lives are actually like. Issues like jealousy, boredom, frustration or anger shape our destinies just as much – if not more – than the fortunes of 3M (the Minnesota Mining Company) and the twenty nine other corporations whose trading forms the basis for calculating the Dow Jones figures.</span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2822" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesD.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We need an index to measure this</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big issue here is how we can get a diversity of indicators on our national dashboards. We are not in the least suggesting the suppression of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. What we want to see is the rise of other – equally important – figures that report on a regular basis on elements of psychological and sociological life and which could form part of the consciousness of thoughtful and serious people. Today, a government cannot get rewarded, or chastised, for the impact its policies have on the frequency of domestic rows because rows are not recorded. When we measure things – and give the figures a regular public airing – we start the long process of collectively doing something about them.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While most of its energy is devoted to briefing us about the gruesome ways in which various people have recently blown up or bled to death in a brutal stabbing, in the area known as ‘health news’, the media takes on a very different project. Here it constantly collects information to assist us in the task of living for a very long time – or possibly even, though it doesn’t ever come out and say this directly, forever.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, we have been told – by scientists (always ‘scientists’) – that eating seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day will hugely prolong our lives. Cranberries are now far healthier than was ever thought. Bananas continue to attract the admiration of ‘scientists.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2409582661_22387a9d53_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7847" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2409582661_22387a9d53_z.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="2409582661_22387a9d53_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scientists! Those magical beings permanently poised to alter the nature of reality, busy inventing microscopic robots that will travel through our veins; synthesising drugs to regulate our moods; mapping our genes; cloning our organs and limbs and reassessing the life-and-death-giving nature of everyday foodstuffs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To live in modern times is constantly to be reminded that thanks to science, a golden land is on the horizon. This is partly why we must keep checking the news in the first place. We might hear that death has been abolished.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2918" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-020414-fruitB.jpg" alt="PM-020414-fruitB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Religious art never lets you forget that death is lurking beside your ripe peach</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, one day, in 800 years time, it will be. But it will be a little late for you and me. And an extra plate of grapes and peas won’t help. The end of the story is written in stone. Religions used to be less squeamish here. They used to talk a lot about death, then place the task of preparing us for it at the heart of their collective missions. They were generous about our need for consolation and comfort in relation to something which no scientist was about to abolish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern news is harsher. It keeps making us hopeful about science without letting us accept the inevitability of where we are all heading. It doesn’t talk with any honesty about final things, it merely keeps drawing our attention, with deranged zeal, to the newly discovered anticarcinogenic properties of blueberries, courgettes and cassava.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew Ridgeley recently turned fifty. In the mid-1980s, he was one half of the world’s most successful pop duo, Wham! Alongside his friend George Michael, he topped the charts in the UK and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the band split, he tried acting, car racing and a solo performance career. But nothing came to much. He now lives in an old farmhouse in a remote part of Cornwall, with his partner of many years, Keren Woodward, who used to be in the girl group Bananarama. He plays golf, goes to the pub and worries about sewage being pumped into the sea. He looks like an accountant or someone whose cement mixing business has done rather well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4238" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyA.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="PICTURE SHOWS EX-WHAM POP STAR ANDREW RIDGLEY IN CORNWALL.  THE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Bill Griffiths</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, it is natural to think of Andrew as a bit of a failure. He fell off the stage of stardom. He’s the guy who used to be famous. He’s been forgotten. He has given in to ageing. George Michael has gone on to have a stellar solo career, has made enormous amounts of money and kept himself at the centre of public attention. He’s still wooing the public and putting a lot of thought into getting his eyebrows right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2910" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyB.jpg" alt="PM-280214-ridgeleyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Michael: Still looking for love from everyone</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact it is Andrew who has been successful. And this triumph shouldn’t just be a matter for him. The kind of success he now has is deeply important for the modern world to understand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2911" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyE.jpg" alt="GEORGE MICHAEL AND ANDREW RIDGELEY IN WHAM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s all so opposed to what he used to stand for. Andrew was at the heart of a hugely infectious view of life. He was a high priest of an ideology, if you like, which was preached through music.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2912" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyC.jpg" alt="WHAM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">80′s pop had immensely seductive ideas about sex, relationships, family life, work and personal style. It told us that nothing should stand in the way of having a good time. If anyone tells you to knuckle down, to work hard, to put others first, to feel sorry or ashamed, to think of the future – ignore them. They are conformist oppressors who don’t know what life is really about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an addictive outlook. It picks up accurately on what, at moments of high excitement, feels like the truth. It lashes out at anything that causes resentment, boredom or disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2913" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyD.jpg" alt="Crowd At Last Concert By Pop Group Wham! At Wembley 1986." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely successful. But it’s also a disaster. The trouble is that it only works for short manic bursts. Life can’t be properly lived this way. This is what Andrew has discovered. That’s why he’s so important. He’s not someone coming from the outside pouring scorn on what a lot of other people like. He’s the guy who was there. He knows exactly how big the allure is. So we can trust him when he turns his back on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t generally think of resignation as a virtue; it sounds like failure. What it means, though, is recognising that big things in life – an OK relationship, a secure sense of self-worth – require giving up some excitement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pop idea of life was so unhelpful because it pretended that excitement was the way to a good life. So it made casual sex seem wonderful, it made the after-party look like the high point of social life. It was the continuation of a Romantic philosophy: the ecstasy of the moment is what counts. On the other hand, resignation means seeing that the ecstasy of the moment is often (sadly) the enemy of what we really want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4240" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyF.jpg?resize=635%2C434" alt="PM-280214-ridgeleyF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Quite a lot really is enough: Wham and Bananarama discover the meaning of life.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew’s long-passed successes as a performer and song-writer have left him well off by ordinary standards. However, he could have made a great deal more money if he had really set his sights on continuing in the world of fame and glamour. This may seem like a minor issue, but a huge part of how the world works is driven by people’s relentless ambition to have ever more status and money. One thing that Andrew therefore does is to define for us a conception of being satisfied, of having enough – even when more would have been an option, but at the cost to relationships, health and family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to think that it doesn’t matter much what kind of music is popular. So long as people like it, don’t worry, it’s just a bit of fun. But music is one of the biggest influences that shapes a culture. It encourages an attitude to life. The songs get inside our heads and the ideas they carry with them stay there – influencing how we value ourselves and our goals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The life of Andrew Ridgeley belongs in the public realm. It’s one of the great moral fables of our time. It’s the story of one man’s redemption – from manic, narcissistic pleasure seeking to maturity. But it’s not just his story. He shows us what we need to do collectively, as a nation. We live in a Wham! society – and yet we need (as it were) to move to Cornwall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s just one thing Andrew might still do. And that’s write compelling songs about his ordinary down to earth life now, with its ordinary pains and longings, its reconciliation with reality mixed with the odd idealistic dream. Or perhaps he could just suggest that we listen to London Grammar, who are on to that already.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t always feel comfortable admitting it to our friends; it is embarrassing. But, secretly, the idea of being famous has great appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fame is deeply attractive because it seems to offer very significant benefits. The fantasies go like this: when you are famous, wherever you go, your good reputation will precede you. People will think well of you, because your merits have been impressively explained in advance. You will get warm smiles from admiring strangers. You won’t need to make you own case laboriously on each occasion. When you are famous, you will be safe from rejection. You won’t have to win over every new person. Fame will mean other people will be flattered and delighted even if you are only slightly interested in them. They will be amazed to see you in the flesh. They’ll ask to take a photo with you. They’ll sometimes laugh nervously with excitement. Furthermore, no one will be able to afford to upset you. When you’re not pleased with something, it will become a big problem for others. If you say your hotel room isn’t up to scratch, the management will panic. Your complaints will be taken very seriously. Your happiness will become the focus of everyone’s efforts. You will make or break other people’s reputations. You’ll be boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2735" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kristen1.jpg" alt="Premiere Of Summit Entertainment's &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The desire for fame has its roots in the experience of neglect, in injury. No one would want to be famous who hadn’t also, somewhere in the past, been made to feel extremely insignificant. We sense the need for a great deal of admiring attention when we have been painfully exposed to earlier deprivation. Perhaps one’s parents were hard to impress. They never noticed one much, they were so busy on other things, focusing on other famous people, unable to have or express kind feelings, or just working too hard. There were no bedtime stories and one’s school reports weren’t the subject of praise and admiration. That’s why one dreams that one day the world will pay attention. When we’re famous, our parents will have to admire us too (which throws up an insight into one of the great signs of good parenting: that your child has no desire to be famous).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But even if our parents were warm and full of praise, there might still be a problem. It might be that it was the buffeting and indifference of the wider world (starting with the schoolyard) that was intolerable after all the early years of adulation at home. One might have emerged from familial warmth and been mortally hurt that strangers were not as kind and understanding as one had come to expect. The crushing experience of humiliation might even have been vicarious: one’s mother being rudely dismissed by a waiter; one’s father standing awkwardly alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fame3-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4252" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fame3-1.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Dreams Of Fame" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is common to all dreams of fame is that being known to strangers emerges as a solution to a hurt. It presents itself as the answer to a deep need to be appreciated, and treated decently by other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet fame cannot accomplish what is asked of it. It does have advantages, which are evident. But it also introduces a new set of very serious disadvantages, which the modern world refuses to view as structural rather than incidental. Every new famous person who disintegrates, breaks down in public or loses their mind is judged in isolation, rather than being interpreted as a victim of an inevitable pattern within the pathology of fame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One wants to be famous out of a desire for kindness. But the world isn’t generally kind to the famous for very long. The reason is basic: the success of any one person involves humiliation for lots of others. The celebrity of a few people will always contrast painfully with the obscurity of the many. Being famous upsets people. For a time, the resentment can be kept under control, but it is never somnolent for very long. When we imagine fame, we forget that it is inextricably connected to being too visible in the eyes of some, to bugging them unduly, to coming to be seen as the plausible cause of their humiliation: a symbol of how the world has treated them unfairly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So soon enough, the world will start to go through the rubbish bags of the famous, it will comment negatively on their appearance, it will pour over their setbacks, it will judge their relationships, it will mock their new movies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fame makes people more, not less, vulnerable, because it throws them open to unlimited judgement. Everyone is wounded by a cruel assessment of their character or merit. But the famous have an added challenge in store. The assessments will come in from legions of people who would never dare to say to their faces what they can now express from the safety of the newspaper office or screen. We know from our own lives that a nasty remark can take a day or two to process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lana2-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4250" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lana2-1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="House Festival" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social media hasn’t helped. It’s made it far easier than before to be famous. And therefore, by necessity, far easier to be hated. A minor celebrity can now regularly face all the vitriol previously accorded only to Hollywood stars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Psychologically, the famous are of course the very last people on earth to be well equipped to deal with what they’re going through. After all, they only became famous because they were wounded, because they had thin-skin; because they were in some respects a bit ill. And now far from compensating them adequately for their disease, fame aggravates it exponentially. Strangers will voice their negative opinions in detail, unable or simply unwilling to imagine that famous people bleed far more quickly than anyone else. They might even think the famous aren’t listening (though one wouldn’t become famous if one didn’t suffer from a compulsion to listen too much).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lindsay.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4246" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lindsay.jpg?resize=635%2C562" alt="Lindsay Lohan Progress Report Hearing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every worst fear about oneself (that one is stupid, ugly, not worthy of existence) will daily be actively confirmed by strangers. One will be exposed to the fact that people one has never met, about whom one would have only goodwill, actively loathe one. One will learn that detestation of one’s personality is – in some quarters – a badge of honour. Sometimes the attacks will be horribly insightful. At other times, they’ll make no sense to anyone who really knows one. But the criticisms will lodge in people’s minds nevertheless – and no lawyer, court case or magician can ever delete them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Needless to say, as a hurt celebrity, one won’t be eligible for sympathy. The very concept of a hurt celebrity is a joke, about as moving for the average person as the sadness of a tyrant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To sum up: fame really just means you get noticed a great deal – not that you get understood, appreciated or loved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At an individual level, the only mature strategy is to give up on fame. The aim that lay behind the desire for fame remains important. One does still want to be appreciated and understood. But the wise person accepts that celebrity does not actually provide these things. Appreciation and understanding are only available through individuals one knows and cares about, not via groups of a thousand or a million strangers. There is no shortcut to friendship – which is what the famous person is in effect seeking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jla.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4248" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jla.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Jennifer Lawrence out and about in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, America - 13 Jun 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those who are already famous, the only way to stay sane is to stop listening to what the wider world is saying. This applies to the good things as much as to the bad. It is best not to know. The wise person knows that their products need attention. But they make a clear distinction between the purely practical needs of marketing and advocacy and the intimate desire to be liked and treated with justice and kindness by people they don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a collective, political level we should pay great attention to the fact that, today, so many people (particularly young ones) want to be famous – and even see fame as a necessary condition for a successful life. Rather than dismiss this wish, we should grasp its underlying worrying meaning: they want to be famous because they are not being respected, because citizens have forgotten how to accord one another the degree of civility, appreciation and decency that everyone craves and deserves. The desire for fame is a sign that an ordinary life has ceased to be good enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2742" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cake-1.jpg" alt="'The Only Way Is Essex' TV show production stills, Britain - 16 Mar 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution is not to encourage ever more people to become famous, but to put massive efforts into encouraging a greater level of politeness and consideration for everyone, in families and communities, in workplaces, in politics, in the media, at all income levels, especially modest ones. A healthy society will give up on the understandable but erroneous belief that fame might guarantee the kindness of strangers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are always bits of evidence turning up that can be used to reinforce such ideas. MPs get rowdy during Prime Minister’s Questions; some of the them fiddled their expenses a while back; they have been known to be desperate for donations and to court unsavoury backers; they don’t know how to answer when a tenacious interviewer goes for them.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1">© REX/Richard Gardner</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But imagine if something far, far more awkward was in fact going on. What if most politicians are not in fact catastrophic, given how challenging it tends to be to govern a country? What if for the most part, they are quite hard working, occasionally intelligent, mildly narcissistic but quite well-intentioned people who in their own ways care quite a bit about the collective good of the country? This doesn’t mean they hit on perfect policies or are effective. But it does mean they’re not merely a bunch of charlatans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This thought is very hard to swallow. It’s strangely not a nice idea. We rebel against it. It’s oddly more manageable to think they are terrible than to think they might be more or less good enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2800" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Theresa2.jpg" alt="Domestic violence report" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Unbearable perhaps: but she’s working hard, trying her best, doing more or less OK</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why are we so drawn to doing our politicians down? Why do we want or need to believe the worst?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because secretly (and rather peculiarly), we envy them. A lot – like we envy anyone with fame, power and a more or less meaningful existence. We envy their connection to the big moving bits of society (the economy, the school system, the future of the air force etc.), their success in getting elected, their status, their opportunity to shape a nation’s destiny, their cars and special passes and their position as insiders in the key discussions and decisions. Furthermore, it’s in the very nature of democracies that we’re encouraged to think that at some level, these people are our equals and should require our gratitude: ‘that person could be me – and I put them there’. And yet it’s humiliating that they seem to be at the controls, and we’re at the back with the other passengers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being cynical about a nation’s entire political class provides a comforting way of telling ourselves that our lives are in no way incomplete. But that’s not necessarily true.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2802" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Osborne.jpg" alt="George Osborne regional visit to South Wales" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Yet what if he had some skills (just a few) you didn’t?</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paradoxically, it’s a sign that things are going well if we are governed by people we can envy a little (and therefore, have to declare can’t govern us at all). We need to be administered by people who have some skills we don’t quite have and who are more or less honest and sane. Yet the price we end up paying for being governed by OK types is a permanent need to believe the country is in the hands of morons.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When we see a picture of the siblings of celebrities, we instinctively think, ‘poor things’. What must it be like if your brother or sister were hugely famous and admired by millions?</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsA-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4265" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsA-1.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="PM-190214-siblingsA-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© INS News Agency Ltd</h6>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Oh dear, my brother has become president.</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We think like this because we are instinctively aware of envy. We understand how having a famous brother or sister could make you feel deeply, thoroughly inadequate. The comparison would be so humiliating and saddening. We’d constantly ask: why not me? We all know envy when it comes at us in sibling form, so we feel for them a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4258" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsB.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="Brad Pitt, Doug Pitt and Brad's nephew exit Dave &amp; Busters in Times Square with Maddox Jolie-Pitt and Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Jackson Lee/Splash</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Being Brad Pitt’s brother</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our instinctive awareness of the difficulties of being a sibling to a famous person takes us to the heart of how envy works. We don’t envy everyone equally. We envy people who we feel in some ways equal to, but who for one reason or another have achieved things we haven’t. There’s therefore no one we feel more equal to than those who grew up around us in our own family. They had the same advantages and disadvantages. We know them so well. They are in our heads all the time. Then why are we not the president, the film star or the plutocrat? Why didn’t it happen to us? Now that they have them, their advantages have ceased to be abstract things that no ordinary mortal has: they become quite realistic propositions – from which one is excluded. It’s crushing and, on some days, just unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3002" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-siblingsC.jpg" alt="PM-190214-siblingsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone and her sister</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, increasingly in the modern world, everyone feels like a sibling to everyone else. That’s because we live in societies with a very social egalitarian spirit (note: they aren’t actually egalitarian at all but the mood is deeply relaxed and we’re encouraged to think that anyone can do anything, just so long as they work hard and put their minds to it). This is nice, but it potentially turns everyone into that most awkward thing: a sibling-like person. ‘Why shouldn’t I be like them?’, is the natural question we now ask of more and more people.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Victoria Beckham’s sister</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to go easy on ourselves. We are ready to see how tough it must be to be related to Barack or Brad. But we’re as yet slower to see that – in key ways – we are in exactly the same position ourselves already vis à vis lots of people, who are slowly driving us mad with their achievements. We have an almost spontaneous impulse to be kind and understanding around a sibling of Victoria Beckham or Sharon Stone. We need to be as kind to ourselves. The toys have been very unfairly or arbitrarily distributed. That’s an OK thing to feel sad and anxious about a lot of the time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nastiness is currently deeply prestigious in the world of news. An interviewer who makes a politician look stupid and mean is on track to become a hero.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It started off with politicians. Now it’s spread to almost any target conceivable. We get a secret pleasure when new films are eviscerated by a reviewer. There’s a warm reception for scathing denunciations of sports stars. There’s a ready audience for anything that paints the Prime Minister or President as a shallow fool; we approve when the people running banks are dismissed as venal idiots, or celebrities as pampered, ageing and cheating airheads. Journalists around the world have made careers for themselves being nasty about everyone who comes under their remit. Entire sections of news outlets (<em>Private Eye, New York Observer</em> and <em>Gawker</em>) are given over to vicious, throwaway assessments of other humans.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An empire of ‘meanness’ stretching from Michael Fassbender to Nigel Farage to Matt LeBlanc to Bernie Ecclestone. The UK Sunday Times’s chief interviewer, Camilla Long</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we have a good time with ‘mean news’, we don’t think we are being pointlessly cruel. We just feel that we don’t have much power in the world, that there are lots of things wrong out there and that nastiness is the best, sharpest way to respond to sickness and evil. We’re being harsh, yes, – we think – but we’re calling time on illusion and nonsense. If we get furious and put the boot in, the world has a chance of becoming the better, kinder, saner place we’d like to see.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marina Hyde of the Guardian: a weekly dose of acid</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the prestige of nastiness rests on some deeply confused assumptions – which run counter to the best ideals of journalism. Yes, it is the task of journalism to be sceptical, to probe beneath the official story and to ask awkward questions in order to uncover the truth. But meanness has nothing to do with this sort of patient forensic scepticism towards complex situations. Meanness has already made up its mind, it knows the story before it even begins to assemble it: it is convinced (through prejudgement) that something or someone is awful, it has shut its ears to any other information, and just wants to kick the boot in with brio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4269" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessA.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="Graham Norton Show - London" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">‘Why are you lying to me, you lying bastard?’</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Journalists sent to interview the extreme right wing French politician Marie Le Pen show all the pitfalls of ‘mean journalism’ in action. Almost all decide ahead of time that they dislike her heartily and see an interview as an occasion to mock, pass swift judgement and deal in insults. This is terrific fun for the audience of left-leaning readers in the cafes of Paris and Bordeaux.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4271" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessE.jpg?resize=635%2C468" alt="France National Front" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that mean journalism towards this woman has done nothing to help mainstream France understand where the National Front is coming from; what it wants, where it draws its support from and what one might do to tame it. Mean journalism has traded the truth for the satisfactions of cheap insult. Meanness disguises that Marie Le Pen articulates real anxieties among French people about the direction of their country. To acknowledge this is hardly to subscribe to her policies. But it recognises a crucial and disturbing fact about a major nation, which ‘nastiness’ merely bats away. The only fruitful way to proceed is to be ‘nice’: not in the sense of naive sentimentality but in the sense of wanting to enter into the mindset of another person, even one who deeply challenges your beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3007" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070314-nicenessF.jpg" alt="School Reform Murdoch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take another characteristic hate figure. Plenty of people are comfortable loathing Rupert Murdoch. They’ve done so for years. It’s rather reassuring. They see him as a barbarian, with deeply sinister motives; he’s wrong about everything and very dangerous. To be ‘nice’ to him feels inconceivable. Yet if we’re ever to understand what he represents, why he is successful and how we might effectively oppose him, a degree of patient humane civility is going to be key.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Central to competing with Murdoch and what he represents is to understand how he has been so successful. This is not to like him or to admire what he has done. Yet to belittle his support base or achievements is folly. If the most strident opponents of Murdoch were nicer – if they tried to grasp how he sees things from his point of view, and understand in a sympathetic way what his audiences like about the things he offers – then it would be possible to mount a proper protest against him – and make inroads into his market share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds mad to argue that we should be nice to the likes of Le Pen or Murdoch. That’s because we’ve unfortunately confused being nice with a couple of things we rightly fear: being naive and being weak. Listening carefully to what someone says, trying to see the world through their eyes, this has nothing at all to do with agreement. If you start with a determined intent to humiliate someone, their opponents are delighted (because it confirms their prejudices) and yet you arrive at no insight into how to win the hearts and minds of the very many people who really do like what Murdoch or Le Pen have to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessG.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4273" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessG.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="Paris Hilton grilled at Japan airport" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Saying she’s an obnoxious, spoiled, rich brat is an admission of defeat</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Or take Paris Hilton. What’s gone wrong with the woman can’t be put right by screaming at her. Being nasty is a natural response. It just doesn’t change anything.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should think of being nice as an expression of confident strength; it’s a show of being secure enough to examine points of view that feel foreign to your own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need the news to be nice, not in the sense of reporting only on cuddly, sweet things. But in the sense of operating with a tone that is generous, curious and civil. Awful things won’t go away because we mock them. But if we understand them, see where they are coming from, and treat their advocates and supporters as fellow human beings, we have much more chance of dealing with them successfully – and therefore of making the world a better place.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels like there is always an infinite amount of news, so much is happening in the world every day. A newspaper could be 1,000 pages long and hardly scratch the surface. Perhaps if you really cared about the news, you’d read more and more of it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457755263.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6849" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/457755263.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="Auckland Council Votes on Mayor Len Brown's Censure" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p2">© Getty/Fiona Goodall</h6>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Auckland mayor Len Brown has been having an affair. News but not new</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet there’s a strange thing that goes on. After a while it becomes clear that the same kinds of events are recurring again and again. The details of the story change, but the core issue is the same. In New Zealand, the mayor of Auckland recently got into huge trouble for sexting his mistress and for abusing his travel budget. In Australia at much the same time a Queensland MP – and head of the state ethics committee – had an affair, and there were sexual photos and allegations of misuse of public money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then it was reported that US Secret Service agents around the world had been hiring prostitutes, visiting brothels and having extra marital affairs. Meanwhile, in the UK the man who had been, until shortly before, running the Co-Op bank was caught up in a sex and drugs scandal. A while back, there was an American president who…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4281" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsB.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="President Bill Clinton Listening" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p3">© Wilfredo Lee/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s been going on a while</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these stories circle round the same archetypal story. It goes like this: Men in highly responsible positions are coming unstuck because their sexual desires lead them to do things that, when made public, are shameful. Really there is just one story here which is being repeated. What could be seen as four (or, over a year, 40 or 400) different news items actually belong to just a single story. There is a lot less news than we suppose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for archetypes – for the basic patterns which recur many times – is not just a game. Identifying the underlying theme is more important in the long run than going through the details of every specific case. The big news – the news that matters – is not so much that this particular MP or mayor or banker or leader did what they did. What we need to address is why such things happen. It is the archetype that takes us to the nub of this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are also large number of stories about celebrities doing ordinary things. Prince William has a child and copes perfectly well with the car seat and the nappies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4283" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsC.jpg?resize=635%2C694" alt="Birth of Prince George of Cambridge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Yui Mok/PA Wire/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1">Famous person does ordinary thing</h5>
<p class="p4">It’s fascinating to hear these stories. But when we home in on the common factor – the archetype – the real news emerges. The archetype goes like this: Powerful and famous people do the same things as ordinary mortals, leaving the public slightly stunned, yet cheered. The famous shed a little bit of welcome glamour, a kind of grace, on humdrum actions. When we’re stressing to fit the baby car seat in the back or when we get a take-away coffee and have to drink it in the rain, we realise that we are not – as we might normally feel – suffering an irritating indignity or a banal humiliation – we are in fact sharing the life of the stars; not because we are making ourselves like them, but for a deeper and more moving reason: they are like us.</p>
<p class="p4"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4668619171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5158" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4668619171.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - February 04, 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of an archetype is to simplify the vast number of things which are going on at any one time. If we were more conscious of archetypes, we’d have to take in a lot less news. That’s why news organisations don’t normally want to tell you about archetypes (ad revenue would go down). We don’t mind.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve grown up expecting that the task of the news is to introduce us to important information which we will need to lead our lives – and by this we tend to mean information relating to problematic dynamics at the level of national and international life (a war, a debt crisis, the resignation of a politician).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4287" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayA.jpg?resize=635%2C709" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, one kind of news story which is oddly, and often embarrassingly popular is one which lies entirely outside the remit of news as serious people define it. It is a story in which an attractive or accomplished person is witnessed going about a minor task of daily life. The story may pivot around an event of complete ordinariness, there is a complete absence of drama, suffering or hysteria. Perhaps they’ve gone out to buy some bread or maybe they are walking the dog. It may be quite sunny. The dog looks happy. The flowers are out. Anne Hathaway has, for example, recently been spotted going out for a walk with her chocolate labrador and a lot of people are interested and charmed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might want to look at 10 or 15 photos relating to this and some news outlets wisely satisfy our interest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3043" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayB.jpg" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<h5 class="p1">Still we want a bit more:</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3044" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayC.jpg" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">And a bit more</h5>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4288" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayD.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6> © AKM-GSI/Splash News</h6>
<h5 class="p2">And a bit more still</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweet though the photos are we might catch ourselves wondering what on earth we are doing spending our time looking at them. The feeling is we should be doing something more important, more worthwhile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We shouldn’t feel bad. The doubts we might feel about looking at pictures of Anne Hathaway walking her dog are largely caused by accidental snobbery. We are liable to look down on an activity which, if it were presented to us in a museum, we might take very seriously. And yet what we’re doing here – looking at a pleasant person talking a walk – is not fundamentally different from the pleasures available in an art gallery. If we went on a special trip to Giverny to see Monet’s paintings we’d hardly think we were doing something a bit low-brow or pointless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet when we look at his lovely <em>Wild Poppies near Argenteuil</em> we are – in many respects – doing exactly the same as when we look at Anne and her dog.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3047" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayH.png" alt="PM-290114-hathawayH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<h5 class="p1">Monet looked at people going for a walk in a field</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just that when a frame is put round a picture and when it becomes famous we are much more generous to it (and to ourselves) and appreciative of what it has to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Monet was a great artist in part because he wanted to draw our attention to times when nothing important seems to be going on. In the Wild Poppies picture it’s just an ordinary day; they’ve probably gone on the walk hundreds of times. Monet is telling us that in just looking at someone going for a walk we are doing something worth taking seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the task of the news is to tell us important things, then we shouldn’t define importance too narrowly. Part of what we need is to stay hopeful about the human project. Hope is an achievement and we find it in these sort of scenes – scenes where no one is dying or suffering, where things are attractive, where there is an absence of sickness and in which everyday, quiet, ordinary contentment is glimpsed.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The church of the fourteen helpers in Bavaria was built about two hundred and fifty years ago. But, strange as it might sound, the ideas that led to its construction are more important than ever.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At that time, the Catholic Church wanted to enforce a specific moral. They wanted to say that everyday compassion and care, however humble and ordinary it might look from the outside, is hugely important. The Church wanted to make this message more active in people’s lives, edging us away from our natural selfishness and busy indifference. They had a key idea about something important and wanted to bring more people on board.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3066" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg" alt="PM-050214-monbiotA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">The carrot</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were also keen to avoid a technique which they’d been trying for centuries and that hadn’t worked so well: that of terrifying and guilt-tripping people into being good. So, in this part of Southern Germany, for a time at least, they settled on a different, much more intelligent technique. They weren’t going to talk about hell and damnation any more, they were going to try to seduce people into being good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4290" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg?resize=633%2C566" alt="PM-050214-monbiotB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The stick</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making people better is a task that obsesses a lot of people today as well. In the last few days, for example, the Guardian newspaper has sought to get its readers to care more about many bad things: not enough women sitting on government panels, excess pay at the top of UK companies, parents who don’t play enough with their children, excessive reliance on private transport, and too many hamburgers from fast-food restaurants. That is just the start. The Guardian’s strategy to overcome laziness, greed and sin is to induce a persistent feeling of guilt in the reader. There could only be a single conclusion were you not to care about the issues being outlined: you are a bit mean, rather callous and quietly complicit with repression and cruelty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3068" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-050214-monbiotC.jpg" alt="PM-050214-monbiotC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The limits of guilt</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The urge to nag is very understandable. The problem is it’s not terribly effective. It will work for a small number of people but for most of us it is off-putting. We instinctively resent being told we are heartless when we we are just harassed; we are already doing our best to be decent people.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Bavarian church is important today because it explores a very different approach. It doesn’t nag, it does not issue stern warnings or upbraid us for being selfish. It does not make us feel guilty about our failings.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4291" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="PM-050214-monbiotD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Uplift</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead the architect used every possible means to persuade people through excitement, pleasure, awe and delight. The interlocking domes and vaults are exceptionally beautiful – inducing a mood of lightness and vitality. It is splendid – but for a reason. It is expressing the true glory of modest goodwill. It wants to seduce us, charm us, into kindness. It acknowledges we might need a lot of encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a big lesson here for modern culture. There are so many serious things we need collective persuading about. The rich need to be persuaded to be much more generous than they are currently being, bankers need to be encouraged to be more prudent around money, we should be more cautious about damaging the environment, more considered about what we eat and nicer to our children. Good ideas about all of these matters are very prominent already. But the news has to date largely attempted to motivate us by guilt, rather than charm us into goodness.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Maybe it is time to take a broad lesson from one rather extraordinary church in Bavaria.</p>
<p class="p2">Let&#8217;s zero in on a specific example: the arctic ice is melting and this is going to have major, lasting implications for sea levels and weather around the world.</p>
<p>A few people care a lot but, strangely and shamefully, Taylor Swift’s legs are far more captivating. They are lovely in ways that seem to defy description: somehow they look ordinary, yet perfect. They are long, yet not freakish. They seem unbowed by their implausible length; both utterly firm and yet yielding and soft.</p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Thrilling</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who take global warming seriously tend to get apoplectic at this point. They’re not wrong. While delightful, Taylor Swift’s legs are of little significance in comparison with the fate of the planet. But getting angry at our fascination with the thighs of a singer is counter-productive in a democracy. We cannot be collectively dragged into being more responsible through guilt. And for a very simple reason. We don’t have to pay attention. If those who care about arctic melt are going to get angry, bitter and stern, they’ll just be ignored.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Boring</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, we really do need to do something about that ice. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are interested in Taylor Swift’s legs not because we are evil – but because we are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make important news not just ‘important’, but also beguiling – almost as tempting to hear about as Taylor’s legs. Then things stand a chance of changing.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3722" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefA.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="Dawn Viens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Californian chef David Viens and his wife Dawn were having problems in their marriage. He became controlling; whenever Dawn went out he wanted to know exactly where she had been. Dawn started putting money aside, to get out of the relationship. David found out. Thousands of couples go through rough patches all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then Dawn disappeared. The police looked everywhere, they tore up walls and floors of his restaurant, Thyme Contemporary Cafe, in the small town of Lomita, California. But they never found her. David eventually explained: he had boiled her body for four days. Only a bit of the skull was left.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is horrific but, strangely, reassuring. They look so normal. He reminds you of a cheeky boy in the classroom when you were a kid. She’s like someone you just saw at the supermarket. The photos could easily turn up in a story about a couple who have an amazing collection of tropical fish. Or a feature on a successful husband and wife rally driving duo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We mostly encounter the edited versions of other people. While we are continually exposed to the unedited version of ourselves. The unfair comparison means we inevitably feel much weirder than we really are. There’s that strange sexual thing that excites you. You feel like crying when you get stuck in traffic. In groups you have the strange sense that everyone is normal except you. At work you feel the need to laugh at a remark which, in all honesty, strikes you as entirely unamusing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3723" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefB.jpg?resize=635%2C435" alt="PM-030214-chefB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Happier days</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is where David comes in. He has redrawn the scale of strangeness. By being exposed as fifty times more strange, he repositions our own lonely peculiarities squarely back in the realm of the humdrum and average. It has absolutely never even crossed your mind to cook your partner. Not once have you eyed a cauldron with murder on your mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is surely one of the hidden reasons middle-aged men turn in such numbers to reading books about Adolf Hitler. His catastrophic levels of insane rage, delusion, destructiveness and cruelty make pretty much everyone else look lovely by comparison. One may have spent the evening drinking beer, made three vaguely insulting remarks and omitted to brush one’s teeth before coming to bed. But by the standards of Berchtesgaden your are revealed as really rather nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not pretending there isn’t a hideous side to what David did. But the focus here is on how an appalling event plays out in the privacy of people’s heads. And despite all the tragedy involved, it may be doing us some good.</span></p>
