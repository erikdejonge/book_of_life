				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business is focused on addressing a multitude of human needs; for everything from Jelly Babies to cardiac surgery to nuclear technology to hand soap dispensers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because human needs are so wide ranging, and span such a multitude of different appetites and desires, it can be useful to divide these needs into three broad categories &#8211; and then even arrange them up a distinctive sort of ladder:</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9854" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C618" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way of cutting up our needs signals the different parts of the mind and body that a given business may be appealing to &#8211; and allows one to segment organisations in the commercial landscape according to what needs they service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ladder also lets us observe how the needs that businesses tackle have changed over time. From the dawn of humanity until around 1750 in Western Europe, the servicing of </span><b>Core Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> constituted the dominant share of all business activity. The limited technological resources of societies meant that the end of work was &#8211; by and large &#8211; just about keeping people alive in a very minimal sense: survival was the priority of business.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9857" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from 1750 onwards, we see businesses starting to address the next stage up the ladder. On an ever increasing scale, they began to focus on what we are calling </span><b>Comfort Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: this is the age when, for the first time in Britain, department stores opened and offered customers a range of linens, fashionable clothes and furnishings. Newspapers began to be read on a wide scale; there was a growth in publishing &#8211; and an expansion in inns and coffee houses. Commerce became angled towards the satisfaction of the tastes of a growing middle class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves the final and most ambitious category: </span><b>Flourishing Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is only very recently that these have appeared on the commercial horizon. The needs have of course been around since pre-history, but they hadn’t until very recently been thought of as something that commerce could get involved with, commodify, sell and draw profit from. It was left up to other forces &#8211; religion and the arts predominantly &#8211; to cater for them, either outside of the mainstream economy or on a very artisanal, sporadic basis. Then, in the 1960s, beginning in Madison Avenue in New York, advertising began to recognise and think of these needs. The advertising industry didn’t quite deliver on the needs, but it knew what they were, for it appealed to them with systematic rigour when selling </span><b>Comfort</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Core Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is in this era that it began to be typical to sell cars with allusions to love &#8211; and to encourage people to buy drinks with subtle references to a sense of sexiness and belonging.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/517232932_9a294cb6bc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9859" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/517232932_9a294cb6bc_z.jpg?resize=485%2C640" alt="517232932_9a294cb6bc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big prediction for the coming century is that enormous opportunities will open up for businesses that can skilfully address our </span><b>Flourishing</b> <b>Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Technology, the wealth of nations and the shift in public taste will make this very likely. A great many of the multi-billion dollar companies of the future will be those focused on the fulfilment of flourishing needs: our need for self-knowledge around love, our desire for a satisfying social life, or our need for resilience. Bits of the tech sector are already nibbling at the borderline between Comfort and Flourishing needs, a trend aided by the forthcoming development of Artificial Emotional Intelligence. This, rather than the economies of developing nations, are what constitute the truly ‘emerging markets’ of the future.</span></p>
<p><b>Core </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>Comfort Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will, of course, continue to play a huge role in the economy; but for the first time in history, it is </span><b>Flourishing Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will begin to provide major opportunities for the organisational genius, commodifying power and muscle of business. Some of the most profitable businesses of the future will be those that understand the trickier, more elusive needs of our hearts and souls that have hitherto eluded the grasp of commerce. We will be the richer for it, in every sense.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are always making consumption decisions: where to go on holiday; which handbag to purchase; which mortgage lender to go to; what style of socks or make of car to buy; what to have for lunch. We don’t normally spell it out, but each decision is a shot at understanding ourselves in some sector of existence, big or small.  The range of our options is inevitably constrained but ideally, in exercising choice, we are promoting our happiness to the greatest possible extent. Even apparently modest things like what we put in the trolley in the supermarket or what shoes we wear are distillations of large, nebulous notions: who we think we are, how we wish to live and what we think will contribute to our well being. From different directions, all our actions as consumers are tapping into the same central question: what will make me happy?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9972076934_d978c6784b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9749" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9972076934_d978c6784b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9972076934_d978c6784b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to think of consumption going badly or well mainly around price. We get annoyed with ourselves for spending too much. Or we’re really pleased if we pick up a bargain.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another way things can go wrong around consumption choices. We choose the wrong things because we don’t know ourselves well enough to select what will best work for us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2546988230_cf30f21653_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9751" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2546988230_cf30f21653_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2546988230_cf30f21653_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can initially sound like a strange and rather insulting idea. How can you possible say that I am not qualified to know what I want? The idea that we might have a shortfall of self-knowledge around purchasing decisions can feel offensive.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pursuit of happiness through personal choice is a key notion of modern capitalism. And it is tied to a critical &#8211; but rarely admitted &#8211; assumption, which is that we already naturally have enough self knowledge and a good enough grasp of our true needs  to make the right choices for ourselves.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1879917264_2d11508922_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9755" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1879917264_2d11508922_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C394" alt="1879917264_2d11508922_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problem is that self-knowledge isn’t as easy and obvious as we might naturally suppose. With hindsight, we can sometimes see we’ve made mistaken choices. One ends up thinking things like: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I thought I’d be wearing that dress all the time, in fact it’s hardly left the wardrobe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I seriously underestimated how stressed the mortgage would make me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I thought moving to the country would be great, but I just can’t stand being cut off from my old friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What am I doing in Croatia at the beach!</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regrets could be summed up as the thought: if I’d known myself better at the time I’d have made a different decision.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5848797681_a3d91236ff_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9760" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5848797681_a3d91236ff_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="5848797681_a3d91236ff_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s natural at times to blame ourselves for these mistakes. But really we’re more deserving of sympathy than criticism, because there are some pretty serious obstacles to the necessary consumer self-knowledge. Here are a few of these obstacles:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: We track prestige too much</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we think we want is produced culturally. We’re strongly inclined to take our cues from other people &#8211; and to take to heart whatever has prestige in our society. We see this &#8211; with comic clarity &#8211; in societies far from our own, especially those in the past. There were times and places where adolescent boys were desperately excited by the idea of possessing a walking stick.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/KUs3XVY.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9740" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/KUs3XVY.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="KUs3XVY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aged fourteen, they’d long for the day when they too could tap the pavement with an ebony cane. It seems funny in retrospect, but it is really just evidence about the power of prestige. We naturally want the things that convey social status &#8211; though, of course, what things have prestige changes dramatically over time. </span></p>
<p>Prestige is a problem when the things that enjoy prestige are not the ones that happen to serve our own best interests. We are so dependent on the regard of others, we may well forget the signals from deep within us that are hinting to us that we are not actually happy with the standard paths being proposed.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mw18391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9762" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mw18391.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="NPG P869(7); Cyril Connolly by Cecil Beaton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"> © Cecil Beaton Studio Archive, Sotheby&#8217;s London</h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late winter of 1961, the portly literary critic Cyril Connolly wrote an article in the Sunday Times about his recent holiday to Barbados. And in it he took a brave decision. He decided to tell the wider world about his passion for snorkelling. Since then (and partly thanks to him) it no longer seems very strange for a seriously minded middle aged individual to don a rubber mask and a special breathing tube and bob around looking at cuttlefish and unusual kinds of seaweed. But at the time it was a very unusual activity indeed. There must have been a great many serious people who in fact would have liked it, if they had given it a go. Connolly was distinctive in the degree to which he was aware of his own needs and pleasures and was prepared to accord them time and respect; his snorkelling activities were connected to self-knowledge. It’s a tiny instance of a huge issue. We don’t automatically know ourselves well enough to know what we’d like. And specifically we are put off by anything that seems potentially odd. We generally fail to trust ourselves over the habits of other people.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: We have difficulty registering self-data</span></i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, attention is selective. You might have walked past an old building many times; then someone mentions that the chimney is an usual shape. You must have seen this on countless occasions &#8211; in the sense that your eyes had flitted over the roofline &#8211; but not actually noted it. It’s a reminder of something slightly disconcerting about how our minds work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often have fleeting sensations of pleasure or disappointment which we are marginally aware of, but don’t focus on. For instance: </span></p>
<p>– The indicator in a particular kind of car makes a strangely attractive clicking sound.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some cutlery designs feel nicer to hold than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The sleeves of a jacket are slightly too long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– It could be very nice just to eat a cheese sandwich at a restaurant.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4716630812_84b9931b09_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9766" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4716630812_84b9931b09_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="4716630812_84b9931b09_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may have these sensations in a subliminal way, but don’t pay much attention to them. Later someone else might point what the lovely or annoying thing was that was going on. And with their help we learn to see more clearly what we want or don’t want. We get to know ourselves a little better in some part of existence. In principle, this is something we can do for ourselves. We don’t have to wait on the chance fact of another person guiding our attention more carefully. But we generally fail to act on our spontaneous feelings.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three: We underrate the long-term</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present instant looms extremely large in consciousness. But our choices will have lasting repercussions. In theory, we know this perfectly well. Yet, with shocking regularity, we make decisions based on the mood of the moment, which turns out to misrepresent our better long-term interests.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not so surprising we have this tendency. The human mind developed to tackle short-horizon problems. In a more precarious world than we inhabit now, this makes perfect sense. For hundreds of thousands of years the primary issue was to make sure you could survive the next 24 hours. That’s the mentality we’ve largely inherited. The long-range, strategic mind is less closely connected to our appetites and emotions.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four: Our habits are responses to earlier problems </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At critical moments of development we take up attitudes which enable us to cope with certain problems.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14274244062_0a750d958e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9768" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14274244062_0a750d958e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C582" alt="14274244062_0a750d958e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s father may have been stymied in his career and so any conspicuous success would look like a criticism of him. It seemed at that time necessary to disdain any expensive item. So later on, one feels compelled to order the least expensive dish in a restaurant or wear only very modest clothes, even though there’s a part of oneself that might relish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">homard american</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or an elegant winter coat. But because of the pressure of the past, these areas of self-knowledge don’t get explored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having in the past suffered from not being able to afford things, one might develop a compensatory strategy of insisting always on luxury. It’s an attempt to fix an early humiliation. It can easily continue to override a more accurate assessment of one’s needs. One is still warding off a worry of ten years ago rather than carefully sifting one’s current needs.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8191196707_381c2962d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9770" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8191196707_381c2962d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="8191196707_381c2962d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<p>These four big factors make it tricky for the mind to know itself. It’s very unfortunate, but not surprising, that it can take so long to sift through them and slowly arrive at self-knowledge. There is information inside our minds that the conscious self doesn’t have easy access to, though this information is central to the project of finding out what we want.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If perfect self-knowledge markets existed, it would be possible to readily generate satisfaction. Unfortunately, we are very far from possessing anything like perfect self-knowledge. Our predictable failures of self-knowledge have large and very unfortunate consequences for the economy.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand is geared towards things that don’t produce happiness</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people don’t understand themselves very well (by understand, we mean, don’t understand the path to <em>eudaimonia</em>), then what happens is: we misunderstand our own needs and make purchase that are misguided: that is, that fail to lead to what we ourselves are aiming at &#8211; our own happiness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5243300641_67748723d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9776" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5243300641_67748723d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5243300641_67748723d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work is low in meaning</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because meaningful work can be defined as work that properly enhances the wellbeing of others, if we sense that others don’t actually need what we’re involved in producing and perhaps would &#8211; if their self-knowledge were greater &#8211; actually reject it, we are left with a nagging undercurrent of suspicion: one&#8217;s labours are sadly counter-productive. One feels a subterranean sense of shame. One edges towards cynicism.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities for job and wealth creation are missed</span></i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evolution of new and very important industries depends upon enough people recognising that they need and want things that hitherto have not been on offer. At its best, this would mean better targeted offering that had an important contribution to make to people&#8217;s pursuit of <em>eudaimonia</em> &#8211; a happy life. But successful innovation of this kind relies on there being a sufficiently large receptive audience; a large enough constituency of people with the requisite bit of self-knowledge in place &#8211; so they have an appetite for the new product or service.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9781" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems around self-knowledge lead to problems in the economy. And one big idea starts to look tempting: does this show we should start dismantling our present economy, built around freedom of choice, and try to replace it with one that’s more directed &#8211; one that limits the scope given to the individual? That was tried in the Soviet Union and other places. It clearly doesn’t work&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other option is to address our problems around self-knowledge. This is more hopeful for two reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: We’ve got lots of evidence that self-knowledge can be improved; only, up to now, the process happens in a slightly haphazard way. It’s far from impossible, only it&#8217;s not organised.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4946657144_27fd314f54_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9783" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4946657144_27fd314f54_z.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="FR Society 29: Couple Shopping in Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: Gains in self-knowledge benefit the individual, because (as we’ve been saying) a gain in self-knowledge is really a gain in knowledge about how to live a happier life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is one of the principal routes along which we could collectively advance towards a much better economy. Governments are hugely committed to improving the economy and direct vast resources to this task. They should be turning a lot of attention to the philosophical question: how can we improve consumer self-knowledge to maximise the chances of consumption going well?</span></p>
<p><b>A CONSUMER SELF-KNOWLEDGE EXERCISE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance around self-knowledge would most usefully come from the company of a wise friend: In their absence, we may have to do it ourselves.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, the thinking-friend asks a range of carefully targeted questions and listens carefully to our answers. But on our own, it’s possible to recreate this beneficial experience by listing some central questions and writing answers to them.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we set out certain questions which provide a framework for self-knowledge.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Money</span></i></p>
<p>– Do you get anxious at any point in your financial life? Elaborate …</p>
<p>– Who in your past had the best relationship to money in your eyes? Describe their attitudes.</p>
<p>– Who had a problematic attitude? What was going wrong?</p>
<p>– How much money do you need? What do you need it for? Be as precise as possible.</p>
<p>– Do you think some people have more money than they need? Explain your answer.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4001186273_845987e5bd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9787" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4001186273_845987e5bd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4001186273_845987e5bd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– What have been your worst financial decisions? What was the mistake? Why did you make them? What lessons should you draw? Have you been able to fully absorb the lesson? If not, what is the difficulty?</p>
<p>– To what extent do you link your economic status to the idea of a successful life (to what extent do you link money and happiness)?</p>
<p>– How well (or badly) do you deal with financial administration in your own life? If this is less than ideal, describe your troubles. What do you think you have them? In theory, how could you improve this? In reality, why don’t you?</p>
<p>– Do you waste money? Go into detail … Describe one instance. Why did you do this?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Travel</span></i></p>
<p>– In fantasy, what would be your ideal holiday? Elaborate as much as possible. What is it about this that appeals so much to you?</p>

<p>– What has in fact been your best travel experience? Go into detail. What was it about this that went so well? Why doesn’t it happen more often? If you could bottle an insight here, what would it be? How seriously do you take this insight?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What would your ideal traveling companion be like?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Why do you travel? When travel is voluntary, what motivates you? To what degree are these motives fulfilled?</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Technology</span></i></p>
<p>– Does anything stress you or annoy you around technology?  Go into detail …</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15851429459_765bc76e17_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9791" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15851429459_765bc76e17_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="15851429459_765bc76e17_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– Do you ever feel you should have a digital detox? What does that phrase suggest to you?</p>
<p>– Do you feel you waste time online? If so, describe a typical way this happens.</p>
<p>– Imagine your ideal relationship to technology. Describe it. What stops this happening in your life?</p>
<p>– What machine would properly help you to live the way you’d like? Do you have it?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Relationships</span></i></p>
<p>– What was your parents’ relationship like? To what extent has that influenced your ideas about what can go well or badly around consumption? To what degree have you learned good lessons from that history?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12436421153_bb8d25721d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9793" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12436421153_bb8d25721d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="12436421153_bb8d25721d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>– In what way could you be a better partner? Realistically, why don’t you change?</p>
<p>– What degree of imperfection can you tolerate? Go into detail around how you have actually accomplished this?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Food</span></i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The entrepreneur is one of the key figures of the modern economy, though what an entrepreneur does is perhaps not entirely properly understood.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain conspicuous activities of entrepreneurship: raising capital, running factories, organizing supply chains or working out how to take existing products to new markets (how to increase sales of electric cars in Australia, for instance).  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14153691690_de6a94461d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9631" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14153691690_de6a94461d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="14153691690_de6a94461d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But then there’s a more private and primary first move behind entrepreneurial activity, which might be called sensitivity: in particular, sensitivity to pleasures and pains that others might overlook… or not take seriously enough or not fully focus on.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can sound like an odd point. We don’t automatically associate entrepreneurs with being highly sensitive people. We’re more likely to associate sensitivity with non-commercial individuals like artists. Our point, though, is that entrepreneurs actually have this quality in common with artists. Collectively, our culture has understood the role of sensitivity around the arts, but not yet fully grasped its important role in entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><b>The Artist</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two essential ways artists display sensitivity: to pleasure and to pains.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artist&#8217;s Sensitivity to Pleasure</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9626" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval.jpg?resize=635%2C522" alt="etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1880s, the largely deserted, rugged coast of Normandy was visited by the impressionist painter Claude Monet. He was particularly attracted to the cliffs near the village of Etretat. Many local people and one or two rare visitors must occasionally have had the fleeting thought that it was a charming place as they drew up a fishing boat on the sand or collected the iodine rich kelp. The difference with Monet is that he took the pleasure of looking at the cliffs very seriously. He painted a series of works closely examining how beautiful the light was at different times of day and he studied the pattern of shadows on the rocks. For him, the cliffs were the source of an important pleasure and he painted them so as to get other people to share his enjoyment. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artist&#8217;s Sensitivity to Pain</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9627" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz.jpg?resize=400%2C656" alt="Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early years of the 20th century, a dancer and choreographer called Isadora Duncan grew more and more frustrated by the pains of constrained Victorian clothing. Everyone else seemed to take it for granted that women and men should spend their days encased in highly formal and elaborate costumes, with corsets, buttoned arm-length gloves, stays and high collars. But instead of just suffering in the usual way, Isadora Duncan focused her attention on it and became determined to fix the problem. That’s why she decided to start dressing her dancing troupe in short, light, flowing tunics. Suddenly one could &#8211; for the first time in centuries on the stage &#8211; see bare legs. The history of 20th-century fashion owes an enormous debt to Duncan. It is she who liberated our bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decade later, the architect Mies Van der Rohe started to get fixated on the pains associated with visual chaos and squalor in cities and homes. He was frustrated by domestic architecture that was fussy, cluttered and complicated. Similar thoughts must have occasionally occurred to many people. But Mies van der Rohe held his annoyance very clearly in his mind and set out to find a solution. In 1927, he designed the Barcelona Pavilion which showed how these pains could be avoided in a simple and gracious way.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9628" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.png?resize=635%2C287" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were artistic insights. But they were later taken up by other more business-minded people and evolved eventually into major commercial enterprises, like the tourism industry of Normandy, the casual clothing business and the field of modernist property development.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9629" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.jpg?resize=400%2C301" alt="Le Grand Hotel Cabourg - MGallery Collection" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Hotel, in nearby Cabourg, built in 1907</span></h5>
<p><b>The Entrepreneur</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receptive antennae, highly attuned to pleasures and pains, are not the exclusive possession of people we call artists. An artist is not so much an individual who is necessarily more receptive than any other kind of person. What distinguishes an artist is that they use their sensitivity to make things like pictures, ballets or one-off designs for buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another possible outcome, and that’s one where sensitivity is channelled directly into commerce. The pattern is less familiar, but it’s positive impact on our lives is potentially greater than the work of even the most celebrated artists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb originated in a distinctive experience of pleasure that was taken very seriously by the co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky. He really liked having new people to stay on blow-up mattresses in his apartment; it was fun meeting them over breakfast; there was a nice atmosphere, because he was really helping them out. He was also taking very seriously the pain of not being able to find a place to stay when wanting to go to an industry conference.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13874449935_34e26e1019_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9635" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13874449935_34e26e1019_z.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="13874449935_34e26e1019_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hands of an artist this could have led to some impressive works of art. There might have been a fabulous installation around the theme of inflatable beds; or perhaps a specialist art book of moody photographs. These works would have sought to convey to others the surprisingly charming experience he had of having paying guests in his own home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding a company grows out of exactly the same original insight. But it has a bigger ambition. Instead of just telling others about how nice this could be, the business directly enables other people to have the same satisfaction themselves. And it is then able to share this pleasure on a very large scale.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9637" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z-1.jpg?resize=635%2C342" alt="8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artists traditionally have been very alive to their sensations: they’ve noted things that delighted them; they’ve noted constraints, discomforts, sorrows and frustrations. And they’ve made works of art to hold our attention more securely on these important but fleeting impressions. We need entrepreneurs to register their own pains and pleasures with equal devotion. For this task, the history of the arts offer an inexhaustible fund of inspiration for the entrepreneur.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a business many other familiar skills have to be brought in as well. But all the financial and managerial efforts are ultimately going into orbit around the original insight. Boiled down to its essence, business is the commodification of a moment of sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not simply noting that up to now there have been some impressive cases where businesses have emerged from the sensitivity of a few remarkable entrepreneurs. We’re highlighting a key ingredient of entrepreneurial activity. We’re imagining (and praising in advance) the entrepreneurs of the future, who will progressively investigate more and more of the pleasures and pains of existence &#8211; just as artists up to now have mapped the same terrain. So we should start to lessen the sense of distance between the activities of the two groups of people, who have often been seen as entirely different human types: both artist and entrepreneur build off the same crucial base of acute sensitivity taken very seriously and brought ambitiously to the attention of others.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our societies are exercised around the question of whether the advertising industry, on the whole, is good or bad. It can be a bit disconcerting that we are relentlessly solicited by people trying to sell us things. One might in some moods wonder if the world would be better place, if there were a lot less advertising going on. But the fact is, the amount of advertising is increasing all the time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to shift the focus to a more specific and more productive question: what is a good advert? Our goal is better advertising, not less advertising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can answer this by considering the six key things that put people off advertising, and then looking at how these problems can be put right. Bad ads go in for:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Shouting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sentimentality</span></p>
<p>– Cliché</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sexual vulgarity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Nastiness (which means giving encouragement to the less admirable sides of human nature, like snobbery and selfishness)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Boosterism</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the six things that people tend not to like and resent in ads that go in for them. These are the things that inadvertently undermine an advert’s power to persuade and to sell. They are, in their way, commercial errors.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5379457132_93c7803345_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9602" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5379457132_93c7803345_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="5379457132_93c7803345_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly, some big clues to fixing these selling errors can be located in art. Art seems a strange place to turn because we generally suppose that art and advertising are polar opposites. A car insurance billboard seems light years away from, say, the National Gallery of art in London or Washington. Artists usually take a dim view of Capitalism while advertising agencies are central to it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16252593627_5993774a68_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9604" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16252593627_5993774a68_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="16252593627_5993774a68_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But below the surface there’s a shared ambition. Art often gets us to like things. A work of art is frequently trying to get us to share an enthusiasm or buy into an idea. And this is what adverts are aiming at too. Over a very long time, art has developed techniques and skills around emotive persuasion. Many of the things that can go well or badly in adverts have been revealed over centuries in quite helpful ways in the world of art. Art has found solutions to many of the moves that can go wrong with advertising. </span></p>
<p>We want to look at the ways the six core problems of advertising have been resolved in art. The point isn’t to suggest that adverts should become more arty, but that they can become more effective at reaching people and selling products and services by absorbing some of the moves that have been rehearsed across the history of art.</p>
<p><b>The six errors bad adverts make:</b></p>
<p><b>ONE: SHOUTING</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When adverts shout, badger and pester they’re of course hoping to get our attention and influence our behaviour. The problem is that shouting is not usually a good strategy. It comes across as slightly desperate. We know from personal life that when we’re sure about what we have to say and we’re confident about why it’s a good idea, we get less &#8211; rather than more &#8211; shrill. We’re likely to get worked up and shouty when we don’t feel there’s much hope that the other person will find what we have to say persuasive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In art, the advantages of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not shouting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been carefully and very widely attended to. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9579" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agnes Martin, <em>The Rose</em>, 1964</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agnes Martin is emphatically quiet. But she’s got plenty of notice. She’s cottoned onto the notion that inviting close attention is a great way to get heard. We lean forward to catch the whisper. So we really listen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s recognised a central fact about how to get inside people’s desires &#8211; which is the great ambition of advertising. It can be hugely effective to be reserved. Actually it’s something we know about in personal life, but tend to forget in commerce. The person you want to confide in isn’t the loud, rolliking character. It’s the quietly warm individual who might be a bit hesitant, but who is discretely signalling that they are very interested in who we really are. Agnes Martin is teaching us an initially paradoxical idea: that you can sometimes communicate better by turning down volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many adverts haven’t yet discovered the virtue of quiet as a strategic insight of communication.</span></p>
<p><b>TWO: THE ROSE-TINTED AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many adverts that present a perfect view of the bit of life in which the product or service they are promoting is supposed to fit. They suggest that families are entirely happy and couples are totally sweet. They insist that a holiday should be entirely lovely, a living room immaculate, a cruise an endless sequence of perfect moments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such ads can be accused of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentimentality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they are editing away all the grittier aspects of reality. The urge to be sentimental emerges in response to an anxiety: the worry that nothing can be attractive or appealing &#8211; in fact loveable &#8211; if there are any problems around it at all. At certain points in the past, there was quite a lot of sentimental art around. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9580" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.png?resize=550%2C623" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artists don&#8217;t know how to do this any more… ads still have to learn (Emile Munier, <em>Girl with Doll and Dog</em>, 1882)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this kind of art ran into a couple of serious problems. The over-insistence that something is perfectly lovely readily produces the opposite effect from the one intended. Instead of being convinced, the viewer quickly becomes sceptical and cynical. The rose-tinted image starts to look a bit like a cover-up. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/idylle-1851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9581" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/idylle-1851.jpg?resize=550%2C659" alt="idylle-1851" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">William-Adolphe Bouguereau, <em>Idylle</em>, 1851</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of being enchanted by the perfect, unchanging love and fidelity of this couple, audiences soon started having the reverse ideas: she’s having an affair, but hasn’t made up her mind to tell him or they assumed the artist might be untrustworthy and lacking in insight: if this was his idea of love, he obviously couldn’t be relied upon to know much about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sentimental ad runs the risk of making people cynical and disappointed around products. So there are people it doesn’t reach at all well or people who get resentful because they sense that the product has been oversold. Sentimentality is commercial strategy that brings a submerged set of risks with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the early 20th century, art learned the lesson and sentimentality almost completely disappeared from gallery walls. The solution isn’t to focus remorselessly on what’s grim. Instead, the idea has been to help us see what could still be very sweet and attractive about what’s otherwise ordinary and very far from perfect. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9582" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image07.png?resize=635%2C635" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kay Westhues’s famous image of children blowing bubbles we’re made aware that things could be a bit tough at times around these children. The older one might be really quite mean to the younger one at times; getting out the door to go to school could involve tantrums. But the loveliness of this unusual moment of tranquility has been held onto. The artist is confident that we’ll recognise that some things are extremely nice &#8211; even though they are not perfect. Indeed, the admission that things aren’t perfect is precisely what will help us to trust in the authenticity of what is being proposed as properly good.</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: THE SEXUALLY VULGAR AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex is frequently used to sell us things. We’re not saying don’t use sex to sell. Clearly it works and taps into some aspects of our natures it would be best to accept rather than rail against. It can sound like a paradox, but the lesson from art isn’t to avoid sex. It’s that there’s a lot more potential around using sex to sell than most ads seem to have realised. Art has been good at identifying the less obvious ways that people can be sexy. It finds sex-appeal in slightly overlooked places. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9583" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.png?resize=635%2C425" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>William Eggleston, <i>Untitled, 1960-1965</i></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US photographer William Eggleston was good at locating where sexual allure might be lurking. The couple in the corporate hallway aren’t conventionally good looking or glamorous. But there’s an erotic undercurrent.  </span></p>
<div class="image_sidebyside size-full">
                         </p>

<p>
                         <div class="clear-both"></div>
                     </div>
<h5>Michael Peter Ancher, <em>A Young Girl Reading</em>, Maren Sofie Olsen (1885); Gucci advertising campaign</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying an ad is vulgar isn’t really a complaint about sexiness per se. What’s actually bothering people is where the ad is turning to in order to get us excited. The young woman reading in the work of the famous Danish painter, Michael Ancher, is sexy &#8211; in an unobvious way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is showing a bigger understanding of people &#8211; one that knows that sexual attraction is quite wide ranging and encompasses aspects like reading quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art reminds us that we can play the sensuality move for a great many audiences that may not yet have been reached by the more conventional approaches of advertising.</span></p>
<p><b>FOUR: THE CLICHED AD </b></p>
<p>This is the kind of ad that picks up on some very well-established features, which everyone has already noticed. It tells us that the car is good, because it can go from 0 to 70 in just a few seconds, that the computer is desirable because its memory is vast and fast and that the washing machine should be yours because it makes clothes extra clean.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are good qualities. The trouble is, advertisers are not homing in on any fresh reason why someone might love a product. And, therefore, they miss customers and opportunities to emotionally cement people to products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see the fixing of cliché in action around portraits. Usually a portrait is trying to show what’s nice about a person. The question is, what ideas of niceness does the artist have in mind? </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.png?resize=635%2C611" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official photo of the 55th US Attorney General, Homer Stille Cummings, was keen to show what was good about the man. And to this, it draws on a list of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">familiar &#8211; and clichéd &#8211; qualities &#8211; respectability, honour, dignity. They are genuinely admirable facets. The problem is they miss quite a lot of other things that we actually do very much like about people.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image13.png?resize=635%2C421" alt="image13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Kennedy</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time photo portraits were done of the 64th Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, art had learned this lesson. The image is alive to facts that &#8211; at that time &#8211; people sort of knew but were in the habit of brushing aside. It’s actually extremely lovely that Robert Kennedy was a warm-hearted father and put up his daughter’s wonkily sweet artwork in his very grand office. It’s attractive that he rolls up his sleeves before checking the clauses of the 1962 Manpower Development and Training Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error of cliché is that it misses very real and powerful ways in which we find things nice. In Paris, in the 1880s, everyone wanted to live on the lower and middle floors of apartment buildings. These had prestige. A lot of selling was based on how nice the view was onto the street. Nobody wanted to live on the top attic floors &#8211; with windows to the back. Usually that was where well-off people made their servants live. The rent was minimal in comparison with the grander floors below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.png?resize=340%2C529" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then artists started to draw attention to some rather unexpected things. Paul Cézanne lived in an attic. But he didn’t think it was a problem. It was his ideal choice, because he started to detect some surprisingly lovely aspects to the views. He liked painting the vista over the chimney tops and sky lights and ridges of the neighbouring roofs. He wasn’t hostile to the facade: in Paris they are nice too. But everyone was on to that. What Cézanne was doing was discovering another really nice thing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/toits_paris-b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9590" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/toits_paris-b.jpg?resize=535%2C435" alt="toits_paris-b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Paul Cézanne, Rooftops of Paris, 1881</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a huge commercial insight: today, penthouse apartments very often have the highest rentals &#8211; thanks to the art-adverts of Cézanne and other artists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cézanne wasn’t making it up. He was sensitive to a very appealing feature that a clichéd approach to selling had missed.</span></p>
<p>FIVE: THE NASTY AD</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is nastiness? It’s encouragement offered to quite bad parts of ourselves. We’ve identified nastiness in a few critical but tightly defined areas. We’ve learned in recent decades to totally avoid the racist or sexist ads which, some time back, were fairly widespread.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image04.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many other areas of nastiness in ads that aren’t yet so clearly outlawed:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a lack patience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a dismissive attitude to certain people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- strong sense of entitlement </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- snobbery and smug elitism </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the emotionally misleading advert (a watchmaker, for instance, who insinuates that the way to being a better parent is to buy one of their watches.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is ads of this type strengthen unfortunate parts of the self. Art has worked out a different strategy. Over a very long time it has discovered how to appeal to our better natures. Artists have found techniques for promoting attitudes that help us become the people we really want to be. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpgBlog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9592" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpgBlog.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpg!Blog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christen Kobke,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The North Gate of the Citadel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 1834</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish painter Christen Kobke, for instance, was very interested in helping his fellow inhabitants of Copenhagen move away from their natural tendencies to selfishness and snobbery. His paintings suggests how nice it is that a smart cadet lounges on the bridge with less socially elevated companions. He wanted to remind us how everyone is touched by the same things: the gentle flow of water, a mild, sunny afternoon, the comfortable pleasure of doing nothing very much around other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobke is making a useful point for our commercial environment. He’s directly addressing half-formed hopes for our lives and advancing a wise image of how to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could imagine Kobke-inspired adverts for breakfast cereal, a menswear chain or a bus company (which could make use of his approach to being comfortable around strangers). </span></p>
<p><b>SIX: THE BOOSTERISH AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosterism energetically promotes things that aren’t really very helpful to us. It loudly informs us that everyone else is keen on something or that if we don’t join in we’re a bit strange. It’s a strategy deployed to sell things like phone upgrades (when actually the old version was more than good enough) or to get us to think that we ought to want a very complicated dish at a restaurant (when actually a much plainer version would be rather nice).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art hasn’t actually disdained boosterism. But it has deployed it in more helpful ways. Essentially, boosterism is saying: this thing is great, you should like it, other people do, don’t get left behind, and in fact there are things that deserve to be energetically promoted. It’s a question of what is being boosted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese artist Hiroshige was a master of boosterism. One of his big projects was to talk up the appeal of rainy days. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9593" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine.jpg?resize=423%2C646" alt="800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiroshige is advertising rain: rain is nicer than you currently think…</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain doesn’t sell itself. We’re so attuned to the attractions of sunshine that we see rain as a misery to be avoided as much as possible. Hiroshige felt that rainy days were beautiful. He loved the way people enter their little sheltered private world under an umbrella &#8211; and how lovely it is when someone else shares that space with you. He likes the grey outline of buildings seen through the downpour. He made hundreds of boosterish woodcuts advertising rainy days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This art lesson translates into the world of advertising, because there are lots of things we might like that aren’t yet foregrounded. We’d like to see Hiroshige-inspired campaigns boosting:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A car that doesn’t go very fast</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A phone that’s hardly got any features</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Tourism in places that get quite cold</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A smart restaurant that serves sandwiches</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim is to get into the foreground things that could be thought as weaknesses &#8211; and present them as desirable &#8211; because, in fact, it would be great if we had a more positive view of the less obvious virtues of people, places and things.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nice that there’s a lot of good art around that’s learned skills of effective persuasion. But art isn’t actually the most important place where good techniques can find an outlet. They’ve been rehearsed in art. But it matters a lot more that they get used in adverts. Up to the 20th century, art was big and ads were small. Now it’s the other way round. Ads constitute a very much larger part of consciousness than art. The ambitions which have been so impressive in art should now move closer to the centre of our society and our lives; the best skills should be deployed in the places where they can have the biggest positive impacts.</span></p>
<p>A better ad can’t just be worthy. It has to be a better selling instrument. And the way it can sell better is by reaching more deeply into people&#8217;s lives &#8211; in short, understanding better how people work. For this key task, the history of art is a resource waiting to be mined and put to work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A substantial portion of the modern economy is devoted to the production and sale of what are commonly referred to as luxury goods; the ‘luxury sector’ is estimated to comprise as much as 20% of the GDP of the world’s 20 richest nations. It is in this sector that we can observe humans doing something rather unusual: paying more for things than they strictly have to; investing more than is absolutely necessary in the business of travelling from A to B, protecting themselves from the cold or providing a receptacle for keys, phones and a purse.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bag.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9489" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bag.jpg?resize=362%2C327" alt="Bag" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, we shouldn’t associate luxury goods merely with sky-high prices; that would be to reduce a useful term unnecessarily. We should take it to refer simply to any kind of purchase where we are paying somewhat more than we would need to if we were solely fulfilling a material need &#8211; and where something else, something more psychological, appears to be motivating our behaviour. We are involved in luxury purchases when we want not just any stapler, but a very particular, slightly costlier one with an intriguingly moulded upper body; and not just any coat, but that one with the cashmere collar and jade-coloured buttons. What properly defines luxury isn’t a high price per se but a price that is higher relative to other goods in a category. We could, by this definition, speak of luxury socks and luxury butter, luxury envelopes and luxury pencils.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image011.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9424" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image011.png?resize=500%2C434" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is traditional to associate the purchase of luxury goods with greed, or a desire to show off &#8211; but this approach entails an enormous loss in our capacity to understand the real drivers of the economy and the nature of our appetites. The way we buy ‘luxurious’ things belongs to a project long associated with philosophy: that of defining and communicating our identity; that of knowing and then letting others know who we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The birth of the luxury sector can be traced back to 18th-century England. It was then that revolutions in production and a rise in income for the first time allowed a sizeable share of the middle classes a freedom to choose from among a range of goods and services. Suddenly, one could pick one of many kinds of soup tureens or lamps, side-tables or sherry glasses &#8211; and in doing so, had to ask oneself a new kind of question hitherto absent from the act of purchase: who am I in the world of objects?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shopping.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9491" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shopping.jpg?resize=608%2C342" alt="Shopping" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Whenever we survey options for our possessions, we are at heart searching for items that will ‘fit’ our identities. We are looking to find versions of ourselves in a physical idiom. Every material object simultaneously possesses a psychological identity, which we have a powerful though usually somewhat unconscious sense of. The phenomenon can already be observed in something as apparently simple as our relationship to fonts:</p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vc1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9461" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vc1.png?resize=445%2C30" alt="vc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could, if asked, swiftly arrive at an intuitive sense of the different personalities on offer: Verdana feels contemporary, unfussy and democratic &#8211; whereas Cambria emphasises tradition, modesty and a certain politeness. They are two fonts and at the same time, two kinds of people. If we were asked to choose a font for ourselves, we would instinctively try to generate a match between letters and our own characters. We would be searching for a version of ourselves in the world of fonts.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly the same concerns might be at work when we choose an alarm clock. Here too we would be looking to find a fit between a time-piece and an aspect of our inner selves and might reject a succession of options not because they didn’t tell the time well, but because they were betraying who we felt we were.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Braunalarm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9457" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Braunalarm.png?resize=635%2C346" alt="Braun:alarm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>                                       Searching for &#8216;me&#8217; in the world of alarm clocks.</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is frequently an ‘aspirational’ quality to the way we go about settling on objects. The word is tricky, and is usually interpreted from a monetary and status point of view, as if the only things that any of us ever aspired to be was rich and important. But in truth our aspirations stretch far beyond this; to be aspirational in our purchases just means that we are aspiring to buttress, or concretise, aspects of ourselves that may at present still be evanescent or feint. This can mean any number of psychological features. We might be aspiring to build up such qualities as calm or intelligence, reliability or cosiness. The objects we buy tell us not just who we are, but also who we want to be but perhaps aren’t quite yet.</span></p>
<p>Material objects matter deeply because we generally find it very hard to tell people about ourselves. Our acquisitiveness is seldom greed, it is an urge to tell others what we value. There may be few opportunities to do so other than through things: words can be hard to find and others are in a hurry. We are lent important assistance in our communicative urge by our clothes, our cars, our watches, our kettles and our glasses. Almost everything we consciously pick for ourselves is involved in the tricky task of defining our identity and conveying it to others. We are looking for our possessions to remember and then eloquently convey to the world who we are and long more firmly to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2091515534_4e1347f348_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9463" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2091515534_4e1347f348_z.jpg?resize=635%2C594" alt="2091515534_4e1347f348_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fair sense of what is at stake in our possessions dignifies the act of shopping &#8211; and suggests how much work we still have to do to help the process go right. To shop well emerges as a quasi-philosophical process dependent on an awareness of who we might be and in turn, what identities the objects on offer are proposing to us. The way in which we discuss shopping rarely bothers to delve as far as this: customer reviews tell us how objects perform materially or technically, but precious little attention is ever paid to what our cars or lamps, pens and phones are talking to us about, what their characters are and to what sort of human beings they might hence be best suited. We should be more explicit about the ‘ideal selves’ implied by objects. We should get more skilled at decoding the psychological messages that accompany objects and tag them &#8211; so that we might, for example, search websites not by price or brands, but by the psychological identities opeating in a category. If material objects are a language, we need dictionaries to help us to spell out the psychological meanings.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t, it seems, entirely yet understand how the luxury sector works. We think of it in terms of indulgence &#8211; and celebrate and condemn it as such. But in truth, whenever we pay somewhat more for the things we use, we’re almost always involved in an act of communicating an intention about ourselves to the world. We’re trying to tell others who we are in the language of things &#8211; a crucial civic activity as well as a highly respectable and noble part of being human.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The average manual that accompanies a product &#8211; maybe a domestic appliance or a car, a piece of clothing or a phone &#8211; is a deeply unassuming document. It tells you bluntly &#8211; often in a language that feels like somewhat unclearly translated German or Japanese &#8211; how the thing works, whom to call when it doesn’t and what kind of voltage it might be wise to use. Most manuals are, unsurprisingly, hastily perused or left unread entirely, thrown in the bin and stuffed at the back of drawers.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00-21.11.19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9467" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00-21.11.19.png?resize=450%2C627" alt="image00 21.11.19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If there’s one category of authorship that seems entirely opposed to that of manuals, it is the novel. The novel is our most prestigious literary genre, it aims to tackle the most important themes; it wants to endure over lifetimes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the two genres &#8211; the manual and the novel &#8211; are not, in fact, as different as one might at first assume. Novels are, at heart, trying to put words to how important things in the world work and help us to navigate its currents. A given novel might be trying to tell us how adolescence functions (<em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>), or adultery (<em>Anna Karenina</em>) or snobbery (<em>Vanity Fair</em>) or death (<em>The Death of Ivan Illych</em>). Novelists will unpick our feelings towards, for example, a tentative spring sunshine or an unfriendly schoolteacher. They are in the business of helping us decode the dynamics of the human and natural worlds. An effect of reading them is that we start to pay attention to feelings we might previously have experienced but missed through haste or confusion. We take on some of the sensitivity to the world that the novelist had; our lives thereby become richer, clearer and less lonely.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3798154872_1af338efe7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9476" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3798154872_1af338efe7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="3798154872_1af338efe7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might assume that literature could not in any way perform its work around material objects. But, in truth, these objects are seldom merely physical, they have rich psychological identities that do, in fact, infiltrate our thoughts and generate complex feelings in us. A relationship to a car or a coat, a phone or a lamp can over time assume some of the significance that novelists otherwise accord only to the natural or human world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, presently, despite the size of the material economy, most of these emotions go by entirely unattended in literature, for they don’t fit the dominant, culturally-prestigious sense of what deserves attention. Manufacturers compound the problem by sticking resolutely to a material interpretation of their tasks; their manuals tell us how their goods work, never what it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like to use and live alongside them. No company has ever before invited a novelist to help to work on a manual.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9478" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg?resize=550%2C639" alt="675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only on rare occasions in the history of literature has a writer broken the rules and picked up on the subtleties of our relationships to things. Gloriously, one of the central characters of perhaps the 20th-century’s greatest novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a car: Marcel Proust devotes many pages to what it feels like to drive around the Normandy countryside in an early ‘Unic’ automobile. We read about the different sounds of the engine in high and low gears, about the feeling of seeing the countryside recede in a rear-view mirror and about the almost religious way in which, at night, the car’s powerful headlamps light up trees and throw shadows across ancient walls and graveyards. In the spirit of Proust’s prose, the American novelist Nicholson Baker devoted a no less fascinating essay to charting the emotions one might have towards the air conditioning vent of a modern passenger aircraft.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Unic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9486" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Unic.jpg?resize=560%2C380" alt="Unic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is through literature that we are given vital encouragement to deepen our emotions towards aspects of our lives. It should be possible to stretch the legitimate subjects of literature to include consumer objects. The ideal outcome is that we can love the things we buy with greater consciousness – which means appreciating their merits and the emotions we come to feel around them.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chipperfield.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9487" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chipperfield.jpg?resize=506%2C342" alt="chipperfield" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To help this happen, we need to reinvent the manual, as a guide not merely to the physical life of objects but also to their psychological resonances. Companies should spend longer on, and devote more care to, the small books they publish alongside their wares. When acquiring a new item, we should be given a book on how the machine works and also a more sensory document charting the emotions that our use of it might provoke and reward. It would be a huge benefit to have in our culture stories whose central characters were not always people but, just as importantly, phones and cars, washing machines and hotels. The manual cries out for re-invention as a legitimate object of literary talent and curiosity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Businesses often provide us with manuals, so we can better use their services and products:</p>
<ul>
<li>a technical dossier comes with your new car or washing machine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a folder in the hotel room, with instructions about what to do if you want to adjust the temperature or have some shirts pressed at short notice</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a flat-pack set of shelves and cupboards is accompanied by an instruction booklet showing you how to put all the bits together</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there are signs telling you how to reach your departure gate</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a safety card in the pouch in front of you on the plane telling you how to inflate the life jacket</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a leaflet arrives with a new credit card</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/125377874_23002a0e65_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9380" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/125377874_23002a0e65_z.jpg?resize=635%2C542" alt="125377874_23002a0e65_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, manuals are quietly charming, with encouraging pictures, numbered diagrams and little arrows. And one feels a burst of affectionate gratitude, when one has been carefully shepherded through a tricky task to a happy outcome: the self-assembly bed is finally up; one’s playlist is at last blasting out on the car stereo; one has found a way to record the talent show. Generally, though, manuals veer towards the tedious and the pedantic and we regularly dismiss them to the back of a drawer without a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these manuals are touching on a crucial ambition. They aim to bring us to an ideal relationship with the things we have purchased. Their approach to this task, however, is limited to addressing purely technical, physical challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are interested in the areas that current manuals tend to neglect. Beyond understanding how a product works, the real goal is to help a consumer have a good </span><b>psychological </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship with the thing they’ve bought.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9387" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="15180175779_7e898c9c25_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with good psychological relationships to people, this involves two fundamental issues:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to love it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ideally the customer feels real affection for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the thing they have bought. They are warmly appreciative of the hotel, the car, the washing machine or the assistance they get from their financial advisors. We know this sometimes happens &#8211; but it is elusive and rare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to deal with the challenging aspects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a product or service. Being around another person inescapably involves disappointments and frustrations. But in a good psychological relationship one copes with them; they don’t derail affection. No product or service can live up to every fantasy one might have about it. A car will start to age; not every employee in a hotel can have a winning personality; inevitably some investment strategies will be less successful; a restaurant will sometimes get very busy and service will get stretched. In reality, no business can ensure that things will always go as planned, and the question of how to maintain love through tricky patches becomes important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understanding how to develop good psychological relationships to products and services we should be looking at </span><b>Culture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, broadly defined as the arts. It can sound like an improbable place to turn for help. But Culture is a repository of thousands of years of attempts to have good relationships with bits of the world. We’re understandably a bit blind to this, because Culture has generally been extremely suspicious about offering its insights to the world of business. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9354" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Caspar David Friedrich, <em>The Watzmann</em> (1824-25): he is trying to get us to love mountains, not get us to buy one</h5>
<p>Culture is a resource waiting to be tapped, because it deals with the same basic issue as companies: how do you develop a good psychological relationship to something. The lessons embedded in Culture can be extracted and redirected to places where we need them today: in our relations to products and services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying something and loving it are slightly different: buying it is the beginning. Learning to love something involves two big factors: properly appreciating the pleasures it offers and dealing with the sorrows that can be connected to it.</span></p>
<p><b>Pleasures</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a slightly strange thought that we might need to learn to enjoy something. But quite often pleasures are experienced in a fleeting, low-key way and we don’t fully recognise them &#8211; just as at a reception where you need to raise an issue with an important new contact, you might barely notice the taste of the unusually delicious canapés, until someone mentions how nice they are and turns the spotlight of your attention on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what culture does so brilliantly across a wide range of experiences. We can think of culture as a toolkit for registering pleasures that we were maybe too distracted or intimidated to notice &#8211; because they didn’t seem to fit the accepted notion of where pleasure could be found. Culture has built up techniques for getting us to attend to novel pleasures, and hence to come to love things that, up to then, we didn’t realise we could.</span></p>
<p><b><b>a. How culture helps when we are too distracted to notice</b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9355" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg?resize=635%2C296" alt="1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku,_Pine_Trees" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Hasegawa</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 16th century, the Japanese artist Hasegawa developed a new subject matter for screen paintings: ghostly pine trees glimpsed through the mist. Prior to Hasegawa, it was hard to notice how nice such a sight is. As they walked through a garden, people must occasionally have had a fleeting sense that this could be rather lovely. But in the paintings, Hasegawa focuses our attention &#8211; he isolates the experience. He singles it out from of the mass of other distracting things and says: this is worth special notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the encouragement offered by the artist, it would feel a bit weird to get excited about this kind of scene: you’d fear other people would have no idea what you were on about. You don’t want to be the one person who says &#8211; this is brilliant, when everyone else thinks it rubbish (we like having some hints around that others will respond positively). The Japanese artist gives pine trees in the mist glamour and prestige. You start to look out for this kind of pleasure yourself. You might find yourself daydreaming about an autumnal trip to Kyoto.</span></p>

<p>For most of human history, people didn’t have much time for hedgehogs. Lots of people must have had a vague sense that there is something charming about them, but this low-wattage feeling would have been swamped by the entrenched habit of regarding them merely as pests with dangerously sharp bristles and an annoying tendency to chew up lettuces and petunias in the garden. The more positive attitude didn’t come into focus until an eccentric 18th-century English vicar in the village of Selborne became deeply fascinated by hedgehogs and wrote movingly about them in his pioneering book, <em>The Natural History of Selborne</em>. And thanks to his perceptive enthusiasm, the hedgehog emerged from ignominy to be seen as one of the most endearing of all small creatures.<strong><strong><br />

<p><b>b. How culture helps when we are too intimidated to notice</b></p>
<p><b>Joseph Beuys</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German artist Joseph Beuys got very interested in materials that we generally don’t find in any way special. He was particularly attached to felt, which was mainly used as a packing filler before the invention of styrofoam. It was seen as a deeply weird interest at first. Artists working in three-dimensions were supposed to be dealing with high-status materials like bronze and marble. But, gradually, Beuys’s enthusiasm became persuasive. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9358" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="infiltration-for-piano" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By wrapping revered objects &#8211; like violins and grand pianos &#8211; in felt, he revealed the kindly, protective character of this inexpensive cloth. A piano, which hardly anyone can play well, could emerge as friendly and funny as a baby elephant.</span></p>
<p><b>Bernd and Hilla Becher</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old cooling towers are mostly thought of as eyesores. And generally they would be thought unworthy of love. It would seem bizarre to get excited by them. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9359" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg?resize=550%2C663" alt="113.tif" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Bernd and Hilla Becher, <em>The Cooling Towers </em>(1959-77)</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drawing our attention to their design &#8211; and getting us to look at them more generously &#8211; the artists Bernd and Hilla Becher reassure us that it’s actually not so strange to feel affection for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These moves that generate love &#8211; by direction, attention and making it feel safe to like something &#8211; have been around for a long time in art. But they can also be very helpful in our encounters with things we buy. We can imagine how they might play out </span>in the world of manuals:</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9360" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg?resize=480%2C360" alt="hqdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Miele washing machines</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the manual is explicit about the technical abilities of a Miele washing machine. It guides us to admire the way the automatic dispensing system releases the liquid detergent in two phases and it draws out attention to the advantages of the Quick Power Wash cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the idea that we might come to really like &#8211; and even love &#8211; the machine depends on noticing and appreciating a wider range of its features. The revised ideal version of the manual would also point out that the experience of closing the door is remarkably satisfying. The rubber round the opening rim is of unusually high quality and when the door is closed the glass fits against it with perfect precision. And it’s very nice to sit on the floor and peer through the glass as clothes tumble around. The heavy drum and quiet motors make a rather lovely low, rhythmic sound. You might want to linger for a while because it’s so soothing. It is &#8211; in its way &#8211; an invitation to a kind of meditation.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9361" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="bmw-330d-touring-7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indicator makes an especially pleasing clicking sound. Also the handbrake is a delight to use: it feels smooth and light and yet not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> light: you sense its power.</span></p>
<p><b>A holiday resort:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9411" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="5686057305_836543e92a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hotel information package will let you know you can collect a towel from the bar and that it’s advisable to book a lounger before 10.30am when things tend to get busy. It’s all set up so you can spend some time sunbathing. But at the moment a manual would leave things there. We already all know everything about why we like sunbathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a lot about why sunbathing is nice which maybe we haven’t thought of yet &#8211; and the hotel manuals of the future would be on hand to guide us to them.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9409" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg?resize=635%2C619" alt="540874976_bbb49eda8c_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basking in the sun, we become a slightly different &#8211; possibly nicer, more sensuous, more kindly &#8211; versions of ourselves. However luxurious the surroundings, the main ingredient we’re enjoying at this moment is purely natural. Nature is beneficent, we don’t have to strive. It’s an important corrective to the habits of mind we’ve generally adopted to cope with life in northern cities where mostly it’s overcast and damp and we feel we cannot be loved except in relation to what we achieve.</span></p>
<p><b>Sorrows</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good relationship can’t just be about enjoying the good thing. It also involves being helpful when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two fundamental ways in which things go wrong psychologically around products and services: they don’t live up to our hopes and, however perfect it is in itself, a new purchase turns out not eliminate all the other problems in our lives. Let’s look more closely at each issue in turn.</span></p>
<p><b>When the things we buy don’t live up to our hopes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising increases our hopes and hints that the object will improve the whole of our lives. They set the bar so high that in reality no goods or services could quite live up to them. The hotel, car or dishwasher you buy might be pretty nice, but you’ll constantly be reminded (often by advertising) that there are much nicer things around. No matter what you have, someone somewhere has something better. The trouble isn’t really with the thing we’ve bought, but with our psychological relationship to it. We’re deeply prone to envy.</span></p>
<p><b>The troubles of life continue</b></p>
<p>You might have a furious argument with your partner about who does what when it comes to laundry &#8211; and the rather nice washing machine is the witness to some lacerating encounters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car is great, but while driving it you will experience many times of anguish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s also important because no matter how good the thing we buy is, we can always end up being very distressed in its company. It was a point made originally by one of the first great philosophers of consumption: the Greek thinker Epicurus. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9363" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="epi006" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He observed that the power of the object to make us happy is, at crucial moments, weaker than the power of the rest of what’s happening in our lives (trouble at work, a row with one’s partner, indigestion, fear of missing out) to make us miserable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical manuals are generally unfazed by the idea that the object may be less than perfect. They include trouble shooting sections and give the number of a helpline. They mention money back guarantees and replacement warranties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the whole, this doesn’t extend to the psychological area. Adverts are often sentimental: in the sense that they are devoted only to showing us the good sides and are effectively in denial about the darker, more disappointing aspects of a product or service. They operate with the natural &#8211; but mistaken &#8211; idea that if you want a relationship to go well you must always insist that everything is just great all the time. But we know a good friend doesn’t behave like this. They don’t abandon us when we&#8217;re down. The relationship is damaged. It gets stronger and deeper when disappointments and troubles are faced together. </span></p>
<p><b>Culture has often investigated how we build relationships around things going wrong or being very far from perfect.</b></p>
<p><b>Virgil and Dante </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9364" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells the story of the Italian poet Dante&#8217;s journey through Hell &#8211; during which he encounters many deeply disturbing things &#8211; like the river where those who have been guilty of vicious anger torment one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dante is accompanied by the Roman poet Virgil. When Dante is terrified, exhausted or confused, Virgil is on hand to support him. Virgil the ideal companion: patient, generous &#8211; and well informed: he can explain, reassure, contextualise and put things in perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good companion isn’t preventing bad things happening &#8211; they can’t do that. Life is radically imperfect and we’re bound to encounter many troubles. Rather than pretend troubles can be always avoided, they help us cope. </span></p>
<p><b>Robert Frost</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9365" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg?resize=635%2C640" alt="800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things culture has become very adept at is letting us know that we are not alone with our troubles. It often shows us that people who look sedate and respectable (as the poet Robert Frost generally does in photos) might really understand and share some of our more harrowing moments. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquainted with the Night</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been one acquainted with the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have outwalked the furthest city light.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have looked down the saddest city lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have passed by the watchman on his beat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When far away an interrupted cry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Came over houses from another street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he’s talking about his own sadness, it’s quietly comforting to hear. It doesn’t make the pain go away, but it takes away an edge of panic &#8211; the terrible feeling that one is uniquely marked out for misery.</span></p>
<p><b>William Eggelston</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9366" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="troubled_waters_c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photographer William Eggleston was fascinated by small town gas stations. Especially ones run by the modest Arco franchise. The forecourts are not very prepossessing, but he wasn’t turned off. Although they are not the sort of thing you are supposed to like, he realised that he did. He liked their comforting melancholy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arco themselves, however, are less aware of their own appeal. When they advertise, they try to suggest their stations are more sleek. It’s a missed opportunity. We’re often quietly moved and drawn to things that are a bit run down, very imperfect and a touch melancholy.</span></p>
<p><b>Marcel Proust </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9367" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the narrator goes on holiday and stays at a grand hotel at the seaside, on the Normandy coast. He has a lovely room with a sea view. The management has gone to great lengths to make it elegant and cosy. But his first night there is very difficult. The unfamiliar objects keep forcing themselves on his attention; he can’t settle down to sleep. There’s a very pretty clock, but its quiet ticking drives him crazy. It’s actually no louder than the clock in his bedroom at home, but familiarity has accustomed him to that and made it ‘disappear’. He hasn’t got anything to complain of to the manager: it’s not really a complaint about his luxury room. Rather he’s describing a problem of first nights in new places and there’s nothing the staff could do to put it right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing about this, Proust is getting close to his readers: he’s put his finger on a common enough frustration: I book a nice hotel room, then I had a bad night. But it doesn’t mean I hate the hotel.</span></p>
<p><b>These ideas about our troubles and sorrows have been around for a very long time in Culture. How could they play out around commercial products and services?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should acknowledge that things can go psychologically wrong around the objects and services they offer.</span></p>
<p><b>Miele</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you build up hopes around our machines. We have done everything we can to make them good at washing clothes. But often tensions accumulate around doing the laundry. It seems unbearably repetitive, even pointless sometimes.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so tempting and natural to imagine that this car will have consequences beyond itself. You will be happy, with your partner, with your work. But many things will go wrong. We know that &#8211; and we are a gentle Virgil keeping you company around the horrors that can unfold in the back of cars. Someone will quietly reject you. The traffic will snarl up when you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot be late </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a crucial meeting.</span></p>
<p><b>Hotel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are problems travel cannot solve. When we go to a new place we tend to forget that there is something we cannot leave behind: ourselves. When travelling alone many people find they get lonely or melancholy in a hotel room; families squabble, couples get on each other’s nerves. We can put a flower or a bonbon on your pillow in the evening, but there are many causes of restless nights.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/43723177_f9c54452ac_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9420" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/43723177_f9c54452ac_z.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="43723177_f9c54452ac_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, manuals have been doing an important task. They have been showing us how to get the most out of the things we buy and how to deal with the difficulties that might arise. But they have done this only around technical matters. What we’re saying is that the psychological relationship to goods and services is just as important. Because many of the things than can go well or badly are psychological: they are to do with our hopes, fears, what we notice and get excited by and what disappoints us. The ideal outcome is that we can love the things we buy &#8211; which means appreciating their merits and bearing with the ways they let us down. It’s the same as what happens around loving another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving goods and services is a big ideal of good capitalism. It can sound a touch romantic &#8211; but it’s actually the best relationship from an economic point of view: it’s the best source of profit. What we’re saying is that there’s a whole range of issues that companies can address to help their clients love what they provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help this happen, we need to develop a new kind of literature, which might be called commercial literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great traditional ambitions of literature has been to tell the story of how a couple moves through hope and disappointment to lasting, secure and mature love. We actually have many relationships in our lives, and in the modern economy, many of these are to do with the things we buy. It would be a huge benefit to have in our culture a lot of engaging stories about how people come to a similarly mature love for (for example) a car, a hotel, or a washing machine.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We&#8217;re used to the idea of sex being used to sell stuff. It happens all the time, usually around cars, or perfumes. Or even less substantial things like ice creams.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/static4.businessinsider.com/image/5193e94e69bedd4f49000000-480/dolce-gabbana-gang-rape-ad.jpg?resize=477%2C357" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Making use of another human being&#8217;s sexuality to generate an enthusiasm for consumer products seems a pretty depressing manoeuvre &#8211; demeaning as much to buyers and producers.</p>
<p class="p1">But before we despair of our shallowness, let&#8217;s go back a few centuries to consider the educational theories of one of the greatest Renaissance Italian philosophers, Marsilio Ficino.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9287" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Marsilio Ficino, far left</h5>
<p class="p1">Ficino was unfazed by our tendencies to be interested in sex. This was, he thought, simply an inevitable consequence of our bodily nature, which dictates that our initial interest in things will almost invariably spring from our sexual and sensory faculties.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason Ficino was undisturbed by this is that this wasn&#8217;t in his eyes the end of the story. Though our interest in things may well begin at the sexual level, this is merely the starting point: the destiny of our interests is to move on to a stage of higher engagement that Ficino called &#8216;love&#8217;.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9297" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=537%2C664" alt="Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And from there, we may ascend to a third stage: the longing and capacity to understand.</p>
<p class="p1">So our interests are naturally inclined, if well tended, to follow a path from sex to love to intellectual engagement &#8211; and this holds true for an interest in people, in virtues and even in abstract ideas.</p>

<p class="p1">Ficino was above all else an educator. That is, he thought profoundly about how people learn and how one can best teach people.</p>
<p class="p1">And so he concluded that the best way to get an idea into someone&#8217;s mind is not to try at once coldly to engage their reason &#8211; it is first to reach them via their senses and in particular via their interest in sex.</p>
<p class="p1">Ficino was employed by the great Renaissance patron and statesman Lorenzo de Medici: both were desperate to educate as many people as possible in Florence to be wise and good, using the lessons of antiquity and Christianity. And they wanted to use art to do this, launching what was in effect a giant ad campaign for the highest goals.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9294" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Ficino&#8217;s ideas lent this educational programme a unique angle. Ficino proposed that the artists Lorenzo was employing should devote themselves to painting successions of beautiful, or plain sexy people.</p>
<p class="p1">We may have often been struck by how many attractive people there are in Renaissance art: this is no coincidence. It&#8217;s a deliberate consequence of Ficino&#8217;s educational theories. Artists &#8211; guided by the philosopher &#8211; were commissioned to use sex to sell: but sell the highest things, like piety, virtue and modesty, commitment to the intellect and devotion to scholarship.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a manoeuvre we&#8217;ve come to forget in our own times. We still use sex, but only ever to sell the lowest things.</p>
<p class="p1">And when it comes to the highest things, we deem them above the grubby task of being sold &#8211; and therefore, they languish.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4682302967_1bdc122a23_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9305" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4682302967_1bdc122a23_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4682302967_1bdc122a23_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With Ficino&#8217;s lessons in mind, we should be more strategic. We should recognise that there&#8217;s nothing wrong with using sex to sell: so long as what we are selling happens to be noble. Indeed, selling higher things with sex is a generous act that graciously acknowledges how our minds really work. We cannot or should not be expected to learn without our senses first having been lit up.</p>
<p class="p1">We just have to make sure we&#8217;re selling the right things, not cars or confectionery. But perhaps things like a book devoted to wisdom and philosophy. Ficino would have approved.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little to the side, or on top of, what it produces and sells us, the average company tends to have an overall identity which we’re used to referring to as its ‘brand’. A company’s brand isn’t strictly limited to what is being offered for sale to customers, it comprises its characteristic way of going about things, its values, beliefs and philosophy. If the company were a human being, we’d say the brand was its personality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because companies are in the business of fixing people’s problems, every brand holds out to customers what we might term a ‘brand promise’. This isn’t linked to any one single service or product, it is seldom directly stated but is present in many of the company’s declarations and manifestations (especially its advertisements). We could say that a company’s ‘brand promise’ is the distinctive contribution a company is suggesting it might make to human happiness.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9062" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM.png?resize=635%2C413" alt="Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audi is in the business of making high performance cars. The advert above is, narrowly, trying to sell us a particular range of convertibles with good sound sytems. However, it also contains a ‘brand promise’. This seems to speak about how we could attain happiness &#8211; as well as a feeling of dignity, order and control &#8211; via advanced technology. The brand promises to lift us above confusion, squalor, fear and trivia &#8211; through the help of engineering and precision machinery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider another company. British Airways narrowly tries to sell us tickets to get from A to B. But its ‘brand promise’ is a far broader thing: the company is inviting us to buy into certain values: of a life rendered good through infusion with virtues like old-fashioned Britishness, self-command, self-deprecating humour, precision and courage in the face of adversity.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9063" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto.jpg?resize=550%2C644" alt="nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand promises are at the heart of what creates the emotional connection between a customer and a company. However, these promises also have a tendency to get overlooked by companies themselves. It can be so hard simply to manage ordinary operations, there may be little time to ask the higher order questions: what contribution are we really trying to make to our customers’ happiness? What is the highest purpose which we could attach to this company? What is our mission? How well are we really communicating it? And what products and services could we innovate once our brand promise is more clearly in view &#8211; in order to honour our tantalising promises more systematically?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as to capitalise on the opportunities that come from knowing one’s brand promise a little better, a company should learn regularly to analyse itself and the sector it operates in. Imagine an ambitious luxury hotel trying to stay afloat in a competitive market. Imagine that the hotel’s brand promise is around calm (all its advertisements hint at this), yet the day-to-day struggle of management is around delivery and the brutal fight with new competitors. In order to get a handle on its brand promise, the company needs to step back and ask the largest questions that it may have bypassed for too long: What is ‘calm’ really? What exactly is a ‘good’ night in a hotel? What if one went back to the drawing board and asked what contribution a hotel could make to the challenges of calm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, hotels don’t think these sort of problems belong to them; they might say they’re for philosophers (whom they rarely meet). They limit their focus to the soaps, the appearance of the room, and the difficulties of staff retention. In other words, they’re forgetting the full range of implicit promises they’ve made to their customers: you will be calm &#8211; and happy! &#8211; with us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/aman.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9064" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/aman.jpg?resize=635%2C294" alt="aman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hotel that took its brand promise of calm very seriously might be led to develop a whole range of new services and products. Hotels, like so many businesses, are only at the dawn of understanding their customers’ real needs, because they operate with an overly narrow definition of how they might live up to the promises that they release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or take wealth management. On the surface, this is a business that promises customers a certain return a year on their portfolios. But a deeper implicit promise is also present around many firms: ‘you will live well with money around us’. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/130061_bahamas_wm.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9065" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/130061_bahamas_wm.jpeg?resize=526%2C258" alt="130061_bahamas_wm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, very few firms have offerings that are actually connected up with this big promise, which renders them intensely vulnerable to competition and downturns in the market. A wealth management firm keen to deliver fully on a brand promise around ‘a good life with money’ wouldn’t stop looking after money in the standard ways, but it would also be asking bigger questions around how clients do actually flourish (or flounder) around money. How well are the clients’ children relating to money? How has money affected the clients’ friendships? What is the point of philanthropy? What has been the meaning of their lives? As with the example of the hotel, these are questions that implicitly fall under the remit of particular businesses, but these businesses are often not looking at them squarely and imaginatively enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrestling with brand promises is not an indulgence. It helps management to think more deeply about what a business should properly be trying to do with the customer’s life in order to improve it. There is, fortunately, never an enduring conflict between understanding promises of happiness and making some money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Society takes the business of making money very seriously indeed. Much of our education system is geared towards giving people the skills to get a good job and a steady income.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, very little attention is given to how to spend money well &#8211; by which we mean, in ways that stand a chance of properly increasing our sense of well-being and therefore justifying the sacrifices that went into earning the cash. The very subject sounds slightly absurd. Surely there is no challenge here, other than making sure we have enough (by which we mean, ever more) in our wallets.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3174937547_dacd881789_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8986" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3174937547_dacd881789_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3174937547_dacd881789_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the developed world, true basics like shelter and food require only part of an average income. An important slice of consumption is therefore directed at things we don’t absolutely require. Some of the time at least, if we properly reflect on our experiences, this discretionary expenditure doesn’t quite bring us the satisfaction we were hoping for. Certain of the more spiritual voices will argue that the reason is obvious: the whole idea of improving our lives via something one can purchase is fundamentally misguided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another possible explanation: that material things can contribute to satisfaction only if we understand ourselves pretty well. Spending successfully is something we need to learn. We need to undergo a process of Consumer Education, simply defined as the art of better understanding the links between what we spend and how we feel.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20433626229_2b36b086f6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8984" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20433626229_2b36b086f6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="20433626229_2b36b086f6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does consumption often go wrong? In part, because we don’t take our own feelings seriously enough. It’s odd &#8211; even a bit offensive &#8211; to suggest that we may not always have a very secure grasp on what we’re actually experiencing; that we could be doing things like buying technology, eating in restaurants, going travelling or choosing outfits and not sincerely be registering our emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, we are arguably often very lax about tracking what we experience. This kind of inattention is perhaps easiest to spot in the visual realm. A lot of the time, we see without properly noticing. Our eyes are alive to the broad features of the places we wander through, but our vision isn&#8217;t focused. That&#8217;s what can make art so powerful when it jolts us out of our customary visual lethargy. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf_1503_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8970" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf_1503_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=550%2C640" alt="Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf,_1503_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: normal;">Noticing all we don&#8217;t normally see.</span></h5>
<p>On seeing what the German painter Albrecht Durer perceived in an ordinary patch of wild grass (in a watercolour from 1503), we can sense the difference between focused and casual attention. Durer took note of every blade of grass, and every nuance in the colour of the soil. We don&#8217;t need to be great artists to pay closer attention to the data from our senses. The core move of redirecting attention can be repeated in any realm of thinking or feeling, and &#8211; in this context &#8211; in the area of consumption. Take, for example, a holiday. We are never trained to study our own responses to a trip, in order to determine how we really felt over a nine-night span and what this tells us about who we are and what we need. We don&#8217;t feel we can learn much about ourselves from tracking the peaks and troughs of our moods: and don&#8217;t strive to adjust our spending patterns in relation to our feelings. Instead, we bump into our pleasures slightly by accident and don’t take either our boredom or our joys as seriously as we might &#8211; which makes us vulnerable to never refinding the ingredients of our own satisfactions.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/211400025_d8636f4118_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8973" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/211400025_d8636f4118_o.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="211400025_d8636f4118_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the big claims of modern capitalism is that it provides us with unrivaled consumer choice. Yet we are hardly encouraged to dwell too long on our subjective sense of well-being in relation to purchases. There’s an extraordinary diversity of products. It can seem as if every possible nuance of preference has been carefully catered for. Yet under the surface of this seeming individuality, consumer patterns are surprisingly standardised. Probably you will have bought a certain sort of flat screen TV in the last few years. You are very likely to buy into one of the major phone brands and update it when you are told. You are likely to have taken at at least one trip overseas last year: you probably went to either a beach or one of 12 famous cities around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this will feel like a diminution of anonymity, or the expression of what might (a little brutally) be called herd-instinct. Until one puts these personal free choices into historical perspective.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/agn47535.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8971" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/agn47535.jpg?resize=316%2C600" alt="agn47535" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are very unlikely to possess a ruff and a dress sword &#8211; though left entirely to your own devices there is no particular reason why should shouldn’t fancy the idea. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/G._Borgelli.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8972" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/G._Borgelli.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="G._Borgelli" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how rich you are, you are unlikely to covet a sedan chair carried by two servants wearing wigs &#8211; though this was a very big and common aspiration across Europe in the 18th century, and it could still prove a highly convenient way to move about a large garden or golf course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so easily able to identify the era of a photo or a painting precisely because patterns of consumption (the things people possess) exhibit large collective patterns which tend to radically circumscribe individual preferences. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10218100.18cff590.640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8974" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10218100.18cff590.640.jpg?resize=543%2C640" alt="10218100.18cff590.640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Their tastes, or the tastes of their ‘herd’?</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just an astonishing co-incidence that these German youths ended up (in 1909) wearing almost identical clothes. They are &#8211; instead  &#8211; evidence of a profound fact about human beings: to a very large extent, we buy according to what others are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is there such uniformity in purchasing decisions? How come everyone seems to like many of the very same things at the same time? It’s not strange that we’ve got a bias in this direction. The instinct to follow what other people are doing is a reliable guide to survival for almost everyone outside of a modern society. You have to stick with your tribe; you have to learn to do what the elders (who have clung to life) are doing. You have to be ultra cautious about novelties and individuality because there’s so much catastrophic danger around. We learn to speak by speaking like others. We learn to be part of a team by modelling our behaviour on that of others. It’s only very very recently &#8211; yesterday in terms of the history of the human brain &#8211; that more than a tiny faction of people have had any opportunity to buck a trend, and stand out or pursue a markedly individualistic style &#8211; with that being a good idea. </span></p>
<p>So we should expect our brains to have evolved to be highly responsive to signals about what most people are enthusiastic about (especially people we perceive as being a bit like us). We find it hard to trust something that comes without widespread support; we find it hard to resist the appeals of something that most people find very attractive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenging aspect of this cognitive bias is that, in the conditions of modern capitalism, we become highly vulnerable to all authoritative and beguiling suggestions about what people in general are up to. We end up experiencing adverts as wise messages about what the tribe is doing &#8211; and we follow.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tour_Eiffel_Citroen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8975" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tour_Eiffel_Citroen.jpg?resize=500%2C640" alt="Tour_Eiffel_Citroen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huge commercial interests are constantly seeking to persuade us to join trends: happy people drink champagne; your partner isn’t serious about you unless they give you a diamond ring; water parks are terrific fun etc&#8230;These ideas can become compelling, even when they are not much tethered to our own reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that the corporations are inherently cynical or wicked. They just have to work hard to persuade you to side with them. The rewards for gaining market share are huge; the punishment for declining sales is draconian. It’s not at all surprising if they get very skilled at getting us to agree with them about what happiness might be like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot of strength to stand up to a trend. In mid-18th century France, the dominant artistic trend was the Rococo style. It was excited by sweetly idealised romantic scenes, prettiness, ribbons, gauze and lots of pastel-coloured flowers.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-happy-lovers-1765.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8976" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-happy-lovers-1765.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="the-happy-lovers-1765" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There were some moods and feelings it was very responsive to: like instances of playful flirtation.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Fragonard_The_Swing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8977" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Fragonard_The_Swing.jpg?resize=635%2C626" alt="800px-Fragonard,_The_Swing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the dominance of the Rococo made it very much harder to recognise the appeal of things which didn’t quite fit its template. One person who held on to his own sources of satisfaction was the painter Chardin. He liked quiet, modest and rather serious domestic scenes. He didn’t like flirtation and bucolic gardens.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-house-of-cards.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8978" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-house-of-cards.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="the-house-of-cards" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because he didn’t fit the trend, he was sidelined for many years. But Chardin was very determined and stuck strongly with his preferred approach &#8211; even though it meant great financial penalties. However, quite often we’re not as dogged as he was; we don’t relish battling against the dominant trends of the age.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the proper process of consumer education starts in a somewhat unusual place: with training on how to focus on the sources of our real satisfactions and in how to hold on to these even when they lack external validation and prestige. It might involve the confidence to know (as Chardin did) that we like quiet domestic interiors when everyone else likes nymphs in pretty gardens, or to realise that foreign holidays or fusion restaurants or a certain kind of smartphone really aren’t for us, whatever our social circle and the adverts we pass on the way to the station would dictate.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13943437120_20175919d7_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8993" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13943437120_20175919d7_k.jpg?resize=500%2C647" alt="13943437120_20175919d7_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to become better students of our own feelings of happiness. It’s often the case that we seem to stumble across things that we really like &#8211; but don’t take proper note of or extrapolate the principles behind our pleasure. For example, late one evening, we might find ourselves having one of the most interesting conversations of our lives. But we can’t quite discern why it happened. It’s put down to luck and the search for how to create such a feeling again is abandoned. Or we have a terrific afternoon one weekend walking down an old canal, finding a series of abandoned warehouses, which seem to nourish an interest in the history of industrialisation. The activity has no prestige and on our next holiday, we are led &#8211; like a leaf in a powerful current &#8211; to go to Rome, where the guide book directs us to a succession of churches, which we find rather boring (if we are honest, which we aren’t  so much).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fatefully resigned to the idea that some very good, very pleasurable, things just happen ‘on the spur of the moment’ or by chance &#8211; or are simply matter of luck. But this is precisely where the whole process of consumption starts to go wrong. We are failing to take our moments of happiness seriously enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time our culture has developed a very different attitude to at least one area of pleasure: the pleasure of eating &#8211; with incredible results. A recipe book is a compendium of rules for reliably re-creating a very particular sort of pleasure; and we have so many by now that the human race can be said to have achieved perfect mastery of the pleasures of the palate. Perhaps the world’s earliest recipe book is called <em>The Book of Dishes</em> (1226) by the Arabic author </span>al-Baghdadi<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It tells us in meticulous detail how to make lemon chicken, pomegranate juice, stuffed vine leaves and olive and goat stew. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image101.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8979" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image101.png?resize=550%2C640" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to recreate the pleasurable feeling of pomegranate juice</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recipes are typically undaunted by the fact that the process of reproducing a pleasure of the palate might be a bit complex, might sound odd to traditionalists, might require special equipment and might have to be rather precise at certain points. This is in dramatic contrast to the way we tend to let other (actually very important) pleasurable experiences rest on chance or simply die in the privacy of our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To come to our central thesis: a recipe &#8211; in its most ambitious version &#8211; shouldn’t be confined to food. We should become the authors of our own recipe books of pleasure. In our private, individual recipe books, we should note what we like, what ingredients were necessary to produce it and therefore, what money and practical arrangements we will in future require in order to recreate the feeling. We need to overcome our surprising haphazardness when it comes to identifying and remembering what we enjoy doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were to focus more closely on our pleasures, most of us are in fact, what was benignly once identified as ‘original’ in the vocabulary of 18th-century England; that is, we are very individual, un-herd like in our essence. &#8216;Originals&#8217; were people secure and confident enough not to worry very much what others thought of them and to let their own pleasures be the guides to their ways of life. The English botanist and naturalist Gilbert White, for instance, realised that the patient study of animals was what he liked above all (no games of cards or dancing parties for him). He therefore devoted all his material resources to tracking down his favourite species and built them nests and homes in his garden. He memorably described discovering that few things gave him as much satisfaction as lying on his stomach in his garden looking very carefully at what the local hedgehogs were up to. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8980" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image002.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we tracked down our own equivalents of White’s hedgehogs, we might find ourselves slightly re-arranging our priorities. We could discover that many of the things we own bring us no pleasure at all, but that a few &#8211; expensive or cheap &#8211; really do make a difference and might henceforth become more focused targets of appreciation and expenditure. We would depart from the big trends in a range of areas, while delighting in them in others. We&#8217;d let our subjective enthusiasms direct us to extreme frugality in some categories and perhaps unbridled extravagance in others. Overall, our spending patterns would grow helpfully weirder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of consumer education has until now been unhelpfully confused with the idea of reviewing. Reviews are everywhere, but they are fundamentally flawed in tending always to assume that you’ve already decided to make a purchase in a particular product range and are wise to do so; you are just not sure which one to go for. You’re going to get a phone &#8211; but which one? You’ll be booking a hotel in Greece&#8230; but which one? However, what is missing from this mania for reviewing is the bigger prior question, the question of whether a purchase in this category is even necessary to your particular satisfaction. Is it worth getting a phone or going abroad in the first place? What sort of a person am I? What do I, in particular, need to be happy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were better at knowing ourselves, the shape of the economy would change. &#8216;Business&#8217; is nothing more than an attempt to please customers. If many businesses are only partly successful at this, it’s not the result of evil: it’s that companies don’t especially have to mind not hitting happiness targets, because a lot of money can be made via the fact that we make purchases at all &#8211; even if we don’t quite get the result we’d hoped for. Furthermore, it’s currently hard for firms to work out what to give us, given that we ourselves don’t quite know what we want. We need to get better at sending into the market the signals that would help the evolution of capitalism. We should stop going back to the hotel we didn’t quite like, or buying the same not very ideal bit of technology, or ending up in a water park, because we were unable to let manufacturers know what we’d really rather be paying for &#8211; and would happily have switched to if only it had been on offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re imperfect consumers because of a quite basic challenge of the human condition: we’re not very skilled at making ourselves happy. It’s a tragic irony that the whole point of consumerism is to please us but that on so many Sunday afternoons, on the way back from a film or a mall, the train station or airport, we may privately acknowledge that we have once again not quite been able to lay our hands on the nerve centres of our own pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumption is a point at which modern life dramatically intersects with an age-old issue: the origins of human flourishing. In truth, consumer education is a branch of philosophy, a study of how we can educate ourselves as to the true natures, and constituent features of a good life. The challenge of becoming the authors of our own recipes books of pleasure still lies before us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don’t think we hate cheap things &#8211; but we frequently behave as if we rather do. Consider the pineapple. Columbus was the first European to be delighted by the physical grandeur and vibrant sweetness of the pineapple &#8211; which is a native of South America but had reached the Caribbean by the time he arrived there. The first meeting between Europeans and pineapples took place in November 1493, in a Carib village on the island of Guadaloupe. Columbus’s crew spotted the fruit next to a pot of stewing human limbs. The outside reminded them of a pine cone, the interior pulp of an apple.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But pineapples proved extremely difficult to transport and very costly to cultivate. For a long time only royalty could actually afford to eat them: Russia’s Catherine the Great was a huge fan as was Charles II of England. A single fruit in the 17th century sold for today’s equivalent of GBP 5000. The pineapple was such a status symbol that, if they could get hold of one, people would keep it for display until it fell apart. In the mid-eighteenth century, at the height of the pineapple craze, whole aristocratic evenings were structured around the ritual display of these fruits. Poems were written in their honour. Savouring a tiny sliver could be the high point of a year.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles-pineapple.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8426" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles-pineapple.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="Charles-pineapple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>Charles II being offered the first pineapple ever successfully grown in England, by the royal gardener, John Rose (1675)</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pineapple was so exciting and so loved that in 1761, the 4th earl of Dunmore built a temple on his Scottish estate in its honour:  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pineapple-450.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8428" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pineapple-450.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="pineapple-450" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Christopher Wren had no hesitation in topping the South Tower of St Paul’s with this evidently divine fruit.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/st-pauls-pineapple1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8433" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/st-pauls-pineapple1.jpg?resize=398%2C530" alt="st-pauls-pineapple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>South Tower of St Paul’s Cathedral, Christopher Wren, 1711</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then at the very end of the 19th century, two things changed. Large commercial plantations of pineapples were established in Hawaii and there were huge advances in steam-ship technology; production and transport costs plummeted and, unwittingly, transformed the psychology of pineapple-eating. Today, you can get a pineapple for around GBP 1.50. </span></p>
<p>It still tastes exactly the same. But now, the pineapple is one of the world’s least glamorous fruits. It is never served at smart dinner parties and it would never be carved on the top of a major civic building.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image15.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8435" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image15.png?resize=635%2C510" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pineapple itself has not changed; only our attitude to it has. Contemplation of the history of the pineapple suggests a curious overlap between love and economics: when we have to pay a lot for something nice, we appreciate it to the full. Yet as its price in the market falls, passion has a habit of fading away. Naturally, if the object has no merit to begin with, a high price won’t be able to do anything for it; but if it has real virtue and yet a low price, then it is in severe danger of falling into grievous neglect.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a pattern that we see recurring in a range of areas. For example, with the sight of clouds from above. In 1927, a hitherto unknown air mail pilot called Charles Lindbergh became the first man to complete a solo crossing of the Atlantic in his fragile plane, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spirit of St Louis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8437" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png?resize=635%2C582" alt="image24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hours, he flew in the most arduous conditions, braving wind, rain and storms. He saw clouds passing below him and distant thunder claps on the horizon. It was one of the profoundest moments of his life. He was awestruck and felt he was becoming, for a time, almost God-like. For most of the twentieth century, his experience remained rare and extremely costly. There was therefore never any danger that the human value of crossing an ocean by air would be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lasted until the arrival of the Boeing 747 and the cheap plane ticket in the summer of 1970. The jumbo fundamentally changed the economics of flying. The experiences of gazing down at clouds and seeing the world spread out stopped being (as it had been for Lindbergh) a life-changing encounter; it started to feel commonplace and even a little boring. It became peculiar to wax lyrical about the red-eye to JFK or a mention of a spectacular column of clouds that one had spotted shortly after the arrival of the chicken lunch. A trip that would have mesmerised Leonardo da Vinci or John Constable was now passed over in silence. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8439" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image04.png?resize=635%2C410" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The view from the plane window underwent an economic miracle that led to a psychological catastrophe: its cost dropped and it ceased to matter, though its real value hadn’t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or think of the bath. For centuries, having a hot bath all to yourself at home was a remarkable, highly prized experience out of reach to all except a very few at the pinnacle of society. It ideally required the assistance of several assistants to heat the water and fill the tub, fend of draughts, hold the towels and proffer the soap. It was a special occasion &#8211; like a coronation or a victory in battle &#8211; worthy of being recorded in a grand work of art. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8441" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001.jpg?resize=635%2C592" alt="Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be an experience to ponder and remember, to reflect upon and discuss with your friends. One would dwell for days on the wonder of immersing the body in a warm, buoyant liquid.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But improvements in plumbing and water supply, in energy supply, expansion in the size of the average dwelling space per inhabitant and the introduction of less expensive tubs have made the bath an ordinary experience. It doesn’t feel as if there is anything at all special about it. In fact, it’s maybe all just a bit too slow: one has a shower instead. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PM-100314-bathA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8443" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PM-100314-bathA.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="PM-100314-bathA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern is the same: the reduction in the way we esteem the experience follows on the heels of a reduction on the cost of obtaining it. There’s a similar parallel history for light in the evening (highly prized in the age of candles, boring in the age of the halogen bulb) or for freshly laundered clothes &#8211; an astonishing, unusual phenomenon for long ages; but now the clean cotton T-shirt (which would have so deeply impressed Charlemagne or Louis XVI) isn’t worth noticing. </span></p>
<p>Why, then, do we associate cheap prices with a lack of value? Our response is a hang-over from our long pre-industrial past. For most of human history, there truly was a strong correlation between cost and value: the higher the price, the better things tended to be &#8211; because there was simply no way both for prices to be low and quality to be high. Everything had to be made by hand, by expensively trained artisans, with raw materials that were immensely difficult to transport. The expensive sword, jacket, window or wheelbarrow were simply always the better ones. This relationship between price and value held true in an uninterrupted way until the end of the 18th century, when &#8211; thanks to the Industrial Revolution &#8211; something extremely unusual happened: human beings worked out how to make high quality goods at cheap prices, because of technology and new methods of organising the labour force.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a craft-based society, the quality of any object invariably depends upon how much skilled labour went into producing it. In the 15th century, swords and helmets made by the Missaglias family in Milan were especially pricey. But that was because they were especially skilled, and produced armour that was stronger, lighter, better balanced and more cleverly designed than anyone else. It was a general principle: a more expensive cloak would be more durable, warmer and more elegantly decorated than a cheaper version. A more expensive window would let in more light, keep out more draughts, open more easily, and last in good condition much longer than its less expensive rivals: it would be a more skilfully made product constructed from more durable materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back of this long experience, an entrenched cultural association has formed between the rare, the expensive and the good: each has come to rapidly suggest the other, and the natural-seeming converse is that things which are widely available and inexpensive come to be seen as unimpressive or unexciting. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Italian_-_Sallet_-_Walters_51580.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8448" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Italian_-_Sallet_-_Walters_51580.jpg?resize=635%2C599" alt="800px-Italian_-_Sallet_-_Walters_51580" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Sallet and armor by Antonio Missaglia, 1450</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In principle, industrialisation was supposed to undo these connections. The price would fall and widespread happiness would follow. High quality objects would enter the mass market, excellence would be democratised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This promised to be an exciting moment and evangelists regularly proclaimed a new age, where universal political suffrage would be accompanied by material dignity and honour for every social class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1911, Henry Ford started developing the car assembly line, which replaced the slower individual skilled worker. The price of cars came down quickly so that it became possible for ordinary workers to afford cars themselves. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designers of the Bauhaus movement in 1920s Germany were similarly fired up in their work by the idea of creating household items that would be both highly attractive and very cheap, available to anyone on even the most modest of salaries.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8450" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image05.png?resize=635%2C424" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>The promise of modernity: Nice chairs, desks, lamps and rugs for everyone</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the greatness of these efforts, instead of making wonderful experiences universally available, industrialisation has inadvertently produced a different effect: it has seemed to rob certain experiences of their loveliness, interest and worth. </span></p>
<p>It’s not &#8211; of course &#8211; that we refuse to buy inexpensive or cheap things. It’s just that getting excited over cheap things has come to seem a little bizarre. One is allowed to get very worked up over the eggs of the sturgeon (£100 for a small pot); but have to be very circumscribed about one’s enthusiasm for the eggs of a chicken (12 for £2). There is an intimidating hierarchy operating in the background, shaping what we are grateful for and feel that we lack and must have.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tragedy for our relationship to money is that the hierarchy operates in favour of the expensive things, which means that very often we end up feeling that we can’t afford good things and that our lives are therefore sad and fatefully incomplete. The money hierarchy is constantly making us feel impoverished, while the hidden truth is that there are in fact more good things within our grasp than we believe (and tend to notice only when we are dying or recovering from a bad illness). We are rich enough to purchase the superlative egg of the chicken; but we don’t experience our wealth here; we are left lamenting our inability to buy the hugely expensive (but not actually much nicer) egg of the almost infertile and evasive Iranian sturgeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we reverse this? The answer lies in a slightly unexpected area: the mind of a four-year-old. Here he is with a puddle. It started raining an hour ago, now the street is full of puddles, and there could be nothing better in the world; the riches of the Indies would be nothing next to the pleasures of being able to see the rippling of the water created by a jump in one’s Wellingtons, the eddies and whirlpools, the minute waves, the oceans beneath one&#8230;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8459" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image07.png?resize=635%2C391" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children have two advantages: they don’t know what they’re supposed to like &#8211; and they don’t understand money &#8211; so price is never a guide of value for them. They have to rely instead on their own delight (or lack of it) in the intrinsic merits of the things they’re presented with, and this can take them in astonishing (and sometimes maddening) directions. They’ll spend an hour with one button. One buys them the £49 wooden toy made by Swedish artisans who hope to teach lessons in symmetry and finds that they prefer the cardboard box that it came in. They become mesmerised by the wonders of turning on the light and therefore think it sensible to try it 100 times. They’d prefer the nail and screw section of a DIY shop to the fanciest toy department (or the national museum).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This attitude allows them to be entranced by objects which have long ago ceased to hold our wonder. If asked to put a price on things, children tend to answer by the utility and charm of an object, not its manufacturing costs. This leads to unusual but &#8211; we recognise &#8211; more rightful results. A child might guess that a stapler costs a hundred pounds and would be deeply surprised, even shocked, to learn that the USB stick can be had for just over one pound. Children would be right, if prices were determined by human worth and value, but they’re not; they just reflect what things cost to make. The pity is, therefore, that we treat them as a guide to what matters, when this isn’t what a financial price should ever be used for.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image17.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8460" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image17.png?resize=635%2C385" alt="image17" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>An object worthy of immense wonder: now ignored</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at a certain age, something very debilitating happens to children (normally around the age of eight). They start to learn about ‘expensive’ and ‘cheap’ and absorb the view that the more expensive something is, the better it may be. They are encouraged to think well of saving up pocket money and to see the ‘big’ toy they are given as much better than the ‘cheaper’ one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t directly go backwards, we can’t forget what we know of prices. However, we can pay less attention to what things cost and more to our own responses. The people who have most to teach us here are artists. They are the experts at recording and communicating their enthusiasms which, like children, can take them in slightly unexpected directions. The French artist Paul Cézanne spent a good deal of the late nineteenth century painting groups of apples in his studio in Provence. He was thrilled by their texture, shapes and colours. He loved the transitions between the yellowy golds and the deep reds across their skins. He was an expert at noticing how the generic word ‘apple’ in fact covers an infinity of highly individual examples. Under his gaze, each one becomes its own planet, a veritable universe of distinctive colour and aura &#8211; and hence a source of real delight and solace. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image06.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8463" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image06.png?resize=635%2C291" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apple that has only a limited life, that will make a slow transition from sweetness to sour, that grew patiently on a particular tree, that survived the curiosity of birds and spiders, that weathered the mistral and a particularly blustery May is honoured and properly given its due by the artist (who was himself extremely wealthy, the heir of an enormous banking fortune: it seems important to state this, just to make sure that Cézanne wasn’t just making a virtue of necessity and would have worshipped gold bullion if he’d had the chance. He did; and he didn’t). Cézanne had all the awe, love and excitement before the apple that Catherine the Great and Charles II had before the pineapple: but Cézanne’s wonderful discovery was that these elevated and powerful emotions are just as valid in relation to things which can be purchased for the small change in our pockets. Cézanne in his studio was generating his own revolution, not an industrial revolution that would make once costly objects available to everyone, but a Revolution in Appreciation, a far deeper process, that would get us to notice what we already have to hand. Instead of reducing prices, he is raising levels of appreciation; which is a move that is perhaps more precious to us economically &#8211; because it means that we can suddenly get a lot more great things for very little money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of what we find ‘moving’ in an encounter with the apples is that we’re restored to a familiar but forgotten attitude of appreciation, that we surely once knew in childhood when we loved the toggles on our rain jackets and found a paperclip a source of fascination and didn’t know what anything cost. Since then, life has pushed us into the world of money where prices loom too large, we now acknowledge, in our relation to things. While we enjoy Cézanne’s work, it might also unexpectedly make us feel a little sad: the sadness is a recognition of how many of our genuine enthusiasms and loves we’ve had to surrender in the name of the adult world. We’ve perhaps given up on too many of our native loves. The apple is one instance of a whole continent we’ve ceased to marvel at.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8467" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a commercial version of Cézanne’s work and we call it advertising. Like Cézanne’s work, advertising throws the best things about objects into relief and tells us in insistent and urgently enthusiastic and sensitive ways what is loveable about bits of the world. Advertising is skilled, for example, at pointing out the loveable things in the new top of the range BMW, the cylinders, the leather seat surrounds, the moulding around the wheel arches (lithe and muscular) and of course the army of lights, skilfully massing their beams ready to attack the darkness on the road ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem with advertising is that it isn’t done for enough things, or indeed the things that would be most helpful and convenient for us to appreciate. People who attack advertising get it slightly wrong: the problem is not that we love BMWs, but that so much of our love and awe has been syphoned in that direction and hasn’t been properly excited in other, more realistic areas.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8470" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.png?resize=635%2C448" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need an advertising pursued with the same sense of drama and intensity and ambition but directed towards biros, puddles and olives. The reason this doesn’t happen isn’t sinister or profound. It’s just we haven’t yet found a way to pay the enormous sums required to glamorise objects through advertising in the case of lower priced items.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image22.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8472" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image22.png?resize=635%2C404" alt="image22" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>He needs a campaign for himself</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our reluctance to be excited by inexpensive things isn’t a fixed debility of human nature. It’s just a current cultural misfortune. We all naturally used to know the solution as children. The ingredients of the solution are intrinsically familiar. We get hints of what should happen in the art gallery and in front of adverts. We need to rethink our relationship to prices. The price of something is principally determined by what it cost to make, not how much human value is potentially to be derived from it. We have been looking at prices in the wrong way: we have fetishised them as tokens of intrinsic value, we have allowed them to set how much excitement we are allowed to have in given areas, how much joy is to be mined in particular places. But prices were never meant to be like this: we are breathing too much life into them, and therefore dulling too many of our responses to the inexpensive world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to get richer: one is to make more money; and the second is to discover that more of the things we could love are already to hand (thanks to the miracles of the Industrial Revolution). We are, astonishingly, already a good deal richer than we are encouraged to think we are.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the widespread availability of good quality cheap products (watches, handbags, cars…), there remains a remarkable appetite for extremely expensive versions of them &#8211; which seems deeply weird at first sight. The so-called luxury sector appears to defy economic logic.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image14.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8481" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image14.png?resize=500%2C407" alt="image14" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image11.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8482" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image11.png?resize=500%2C557" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two timepieces do very much the same thing. Both can tell you barometric pressure at 1,000 feet below the surface of the sea; both will be able to time a 100 meter race down to split second accuracy; both can accommodate leap years with ease; and both are elegantly styled in sensuous steel alloys. But a key difference is that one costs £100, and the other £20,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the immediate question is: why would someone spend two hundred times more on a watch? The standard response at this point is to get rather severe, judgmental and censorious; and to assume that the only reason one might buy the expensive item is the desire to show off, to parade one’s affluence and to try to humiliate others. In short, buying it is a piece of aggressive self-assertion. This sort of analysis derives from our society’s folk memory of a stock character in fiction &#8211; the mean rich idiot &#8211; whom we know from Rabelais and Dickens, Thackeray and Amis. The names may keep changing but the character is the same.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image.jpg?resize=635%2C338" alt="image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Nick Frost as John Self in a 2010 BBC adaptation of Amis&#8217;s <em>Money.</em></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the key to human progress isn’t how energetically we denounce things, but how perceptively we come to understand the inner workings of troubling behaviour (whether it be shoplifting, bulimia or buying a Rolex). As we have arduously managed to get better accounts of the origins of crime (and therefore come to deal with it more adroitly), a similar move awaits in the area of luxury goods. We’re facing a pathology which needs to be treated with kindness and insight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue needs to be addressed urgently because it’s remarkably stressful to live in a society where luxury seems like a necessary route to a good life. The implicit philosophy of luxury goods is that the ingredients of fulfilment lie considerably outside an ordinary salary; which condemns a huge section of society to feelings of incompleteness. By definition ‘luxury’ is what 95% of the population either cannot, or can only just (with huge effort) afford. So there’s a genuine need to attack the brilliance with which luxury has managed to position itself as both central to life &#8211; yet unavailable. Luxury has a menacing, baffling position in relation to our ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we can suggest that the impulse to buy luxury goods doesn’t come from greed or the desire to humiliate others. It springs from two motives. The first is fear; fear of most other people. The love of luxury breeds in societies where it feels very dangerous to be average, like 18th-century France or contemporary India or China. It isn’t coincidental that the love of luxury has been particularly in evidence in societies where the average existence is a properly painful place to be. It may be easy for us to dismiss as ‘superfluous’ the layers of gold, the cherubs, the diamonds and sculpted reliefs; but these can seem like very necessary tokens of separation between the owner and a genuinely squalid world beyond. They are forms of protection against the terror of an average life, in societies where average means appalling.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image08.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8484" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image08.png?resize=400%2C359" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Napoleonic_Fabergé_egg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8485" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Napoleonic_Fabergé_egg.jpg?resize=400%2C516" alt="DSC_0069" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste for luxury isn’t just defined by the trajectory of nations, it is also defined by a person’s place within a society. It shouldn’t surprise us that a taste relatively close to that found at Versailles should also thrive in some south London housing estates. The motives are the same: it is a desire to show that one is ‘different’, when being the same means to be very short of dignity and respect.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8486" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image19.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also shouldn’t surprise us that certain places are rather inimical to luxury, that Rolex and Louis Vuitton, Prada and Aston Martin have done spectacularly badly in Denmark, a country which boasts the third highest level per capita income in the world and one of the most equal distributions of wealth anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish case illustrates one large possible solution to the social problem of luxury. The desire for luxury is inversely related to the level of dignity of an average life; as dignity goes up, so the desire for luxury comes down. It was never really about greed, the love of luxury was an individual response to a political failure: the inability of governments to ensure that an average life could be a flourishing life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8487" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But politics may take a very long time to solve this issue and while we wait, there’s another major move to undercut the debilitating need for luxury. Politics wants to change ordinary life; but another strategy is to re-evaluate ordinary life, to see the hidden worth beneath apparently unimpressive things and people. This is the move that has, traditionally, been made by certain religions, Christianity and Buddhism in particular. Both these disciplines upgrade the average, they insist that very important things are going on in humble vessels. They deny that outward show is the sign of value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In John Everett Millais’s 1850 painting &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christ in the House of his Parents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the central, most esteemed figure of Christianity, Jesus himself, is shown in his everyday surroundings. It is emphatically an ‘ordinary’ place that the King of Kings inhabits. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_The_Carpenters_Shop_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8478" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_The_Carpenters_Shop_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_(&#96;The_Carpenter's_Shop')_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millais has carefully portrayed the messy earthen floor, the bare walls, the homespun clothes, the lack of shoes; the absence of any of the period equivalent of luxury brands. But at the same time he’s asking us to see this unglamorous scene as hugely important. The most esteemed things in the world are going on here &#8211; only without much external show. It’s a message Christianity was trying to teach in many ways: the ordinary isn’t really ordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to be officially religious, or even that sympathetic to many of the tenets of the faiths, to see the worth of this move. It’s one that has developed an independent life; we see it in the visual arts without any superstitious underpinnings, for example, in the work of the Danish painter, Christen Kobke, who stokes our enthusiasm for unpretentious calm evenings by the lake shore. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8479" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That we should be drawn to luxury isn&#8217;t just a fear of the average, it’s also a symptom of trust in authority, driven to a potentially excessive degree. Trust in authority is frequently a very good thing. It&#8217;s what gets us through school, allows us to drive cars safely in busy cities, means we will queue willingly at airports and follow the instructions of a fire officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied to culture, trust in authority has been useful in directing us to some great works: it is what advised us to pay attention to the paintings of Rothko and the novels W.G. Sebald (neither of which we might, left to ourselves, have encountered or persisted with). </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8480" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg?resize=480%2C600" alt="No_61_Mark_Rothko" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>Trust in cultural authority got us to be notice this.</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this trust can be usurped by the less deserving characters from ad agencies, who act a little like a malevolent supply teacher who work on a student’s credulity, exploiting his trust in authority, built up over years by a series of benign teachers. </span>Our willingness to do what we’re assured is the right thing gets us into trouble when it’s hijacked by people who don’t really have our best interests at heart.</p>

<p>Our love of luxury goods isn’t freakish or vainglorious. It is attuned to some genuine needs: the need not to be drawn into a degraded average existence and to follow the prestigious voices of authority, speaking to us from billboards and magazines. These goods will continue to hold a central place until we find better solutions to the problems in our natures and in our societies that they so adroitly feed upon.</p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3253842434_b84d76ab72_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7659" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3253842434_b84d76ab72_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3253842434_b84d76ab72_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relationship between consumer and advertiser has become like a game of nagging and pestering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The advertiser feels the consumer doesn&#8217;t really want what&#8217;s on offer, but assumes that if it just keeps popping up all the time (and perhaps cracks a joke or gets half undressed), eventually the consumer will give up and buy the damned toothbrush, chocolate bar or insurance policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering people can feel like a natural strategy for advertisers to fall back on when striving to gain our attention. After all, this is what we all did when we were very young and had no other options. A six-year-old has no capacity to rationally persuade her parents to buy her a goldfish but she will instinctively assume that asking a million times might just work (and, occasionally, it does). When we’re stressed to keep our jobs at the agency, we may return easily to such early badgering instincts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lamentable thing is that a badgering approach is unnecessary, because it isn&#8217;t as if most of us don&#8217;t want to buy things and have no material needs. We&#8217;re constantly wanting to shop. The act of buying isn&#8217;t something foisted upon us by an evil advertising industry &#8211; as people in advertising seem somehow to believe in their hearts. It&#8217;s something we naturally and spontaneously feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/38623561_adb17e6124_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7661" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/38623561_adb17e6124_z.jpg?resize=635%2C408" alt="38623561_adb17e6124_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at present, there&#8217;s simply no incentive for us to tell advertisers about what we might need because we don&#8217;t trust them not to keep bugging us if ever we were to reveal more about ourselves. They&#8217;ve annoyed us far too much already for us to let on about our interests. We don&#8217;t want to tell them that we&#8217;re potentially in the market for a new car and wouldn&#8217;t mind being shown some options for a nice woollen jacket. We&#8217;d never share such private information because we suspect how it might then all go: we&#8217;d be bothered ad nauseam, possibly for decades; we wouldn&#8217;t be presented with the real range of options and our details would be passed on to other firms selling utterly off-beat things, like inflatable dinghies and lunch boxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So instead, we just lie low and remain deeply guarded about sharing anything about our lives &#8211; which is what, in turn, leads advertisers to bully us and spy on us, to track our online moves and, when they&#8217;re really fed up and desperate, to bung up our computers with pop ups.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/fa9b534892464058aea0242965e04401/200586432/pop-ups.jpg?resize=630%2C404" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relationship between customer and advertiser has wound up being marked by a total lack of trust on both sides. Customers don&#8217;t trust that advertisers will look after their real needs. And advertisers don&#8217;t trust that customers will listen to an honest pitch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However sad the situation, it does hint at the shape of an eventual answer. If advertisers became more responsible, and could be trusted not to foist random things on us, then we would tell them about ourselves and our needs, perhaps quite a lot. The more we thought well of them, the more details we&#8217;d reveal &#8211; as we might to a friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we only become friends with people we can trust; and that to date, doesn&#8217;t encompass the advertising industry. If these people want to earn our time and sincere attention, then they need to stop tracking us with cookies and trying to show up with hardly any clothes on in weird places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-vCAlGgAbq3s/U5Mjoo3TS5I/AAAAAAAAAP4/1rlBgVrljJI/s1600/f67c99de2af5af20e4db8d5b0c46d7c7.jpg?resize=623%2C390" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Advertisers need to behave with the sort of dignity and self-respect of people who know they could properly improve the lives of others once they got to know them well. Then we might willingly start to listen and tell them about ourselves.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patek Philippe is one of the giants of the global watchmaking industry, with revenues last year of just short of 750 million euros. For years now, they have been running a very distinctive series of adverts featuring parents and children. You’re sure to have glimpsed one somewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4185" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsA1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="PM-200214-advertsA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In one example, there’s a father and son together in a motorboat, a scene which tenderly evokes filial and paternal loyalty and love. The son is listening carefully while his kindly dad is telling him about some aspect of seafaring. We can imagine the boy will grow up confident and independent – yet also respectful and warm. He’ll be keen to follow in his father’s footsteps and emulate his best sides. The father has put a lot of work into the relationship (one senses they’ve been out on the water a number of times, and when the boy was younger, there might have been marathon Lego building sessions in the bedroom) and now the love is being properly paid back. The advertisement understands our deepest hopes. Yet it is moving precisely because what it depicts is so hard to find in real life. Father-son relationships rarely go so well. There is neglect, rebellion and bitterness. Dad was too often away. The son is caught up in a bad group at school. There’s no chance to talk any more. But for a moment, thanks to Patek Philippe, we are afforded a glimpse of psychological paradise; no wonder if we are touched.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsB11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4882" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsB11.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="PM-200214-advertsB1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take this ad from Calvin Klein. The parents and children have tumbled together in a happy heap. There is laughter; everyone can be silly together, there is no more need to put up a front, because everyone here is trusting and on the same side. No one understands you like these people do. In the anonymous airport lounge, in the lonely hotel room, you’ll think back to this cozy group and miss them terribly. Alternatively, you might already miss those years, quite a way back, when it was all so easy. The kids are older now and the stresses are much greater. Only last week, there was a horrific row over drugs and mobile phones. Your relationship with your spouse is suffering too. Calvin Klein knows all this; it too has latched on to our deepest, and at the same time, most elusive inner longings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adverts wouldn’t work as well as they do if they didn’t operate with a very good sense of what our real needs are; what we really require to be happy. Their emotional pull is based on knowing us extremely well. We are creatures who hunger for sexual love, good family relationships, connections with others and the feeling that we are respected. Advertisers understand these needs so very well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, armed with this knowledge, they are unwittingly extremely cruel to us. For while they excite us with reminders of our buried longings, they refuse to do anything sensible or sincere to quench them adequately. They show us paradise, then don’t sell us anything with whose help we might reach it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, adverts do sell us things. Just rather inadequate things in relation to the hopes they arouse. Calvin Klein makes lovely cologne. Patek Philippe’s watches are extremely reliable agents of time-keeping. But it’s hard to see how these products are going to help us secure the goods our unconscious believed were on offer. A watch, or a bottle of scent – however excellent in their own way – don’t have the answers to our psychological needs (which impelled our purchases). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsC1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4885" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsC1.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="PM-200214-advertsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re often selling each other the wrong things; material things rather than the more important psychological tools we need.</span> Business needs to get more ambitious, we should turn our energies to creating new kinds of products – as strange sounding today as a wrist watch would have seemed in 1500. We need the drive of commerce and industrialisation to get behind filling the world – and our lives – with products that really can help us to thrive, flourish, find contentment and manage our relationships well. Only this will help us to make real the lovely ideals which the adverts of today make us gaze at from far away.</p>
<p class="p1">At present, adverts often look slightly ridiculous if they are examined carefully. The teams of executive and creatives who came up with this image put a finger on some big concerns. They realise how much we long for companionship, confidence and a feeling of freedom. This ad is designed to enliven our hopes:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ad1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9194" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ad1.jpg?resize=423%2C317" alt="Ad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Yet all that is on offer to help us in our quest for a better life is a phone. It might be great but on its own can do little to help us find the feelings which the image evokes.</p>
<p>It’s common to complain that the advert is attempting to trick us into embracing a falsehood; trying to get us to believe that if only we buy the product we will get the other things too. It’s a recurrent theme in our relationships with advertisements.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google-ad-crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9549" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google-ad-crop.jpg?resize=651%2C394" alt="Google ad crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In order to sell us its products, Google is tapping into one of our greatest emotional needs: the sense that we have properly explored the world and humanity. However, having evoked this grand need, the answer it proposes is humbly small: this is a call for us to spend a bit more time looking up a restaurant or cinema on Google Maps. That&#8217;s no terrible thing, but it&#8217;s rather a let-down given the emotional button that Google&#8217;s advert had skilfully pressed.</p>
<p>It can seem as if the adverts are trying to deceive us, alluding to emotional needs while in fact only catering to material ones. But, in fact, the problem does not usually lie with the advert, rather with the products on offer. The need for a sense of belonging or a sense of exploration are real, but a phone or map app, however good, probably aren&#8217;t the answer. The worries are much bigger than the products seem to understand.</p>
<p>The real crisis of Capitalism is that product development lags so far behind the best insights of advertising. Advertising has cottoned onto the fact that we would love to get help with the true challenges of life. We want to have better careers, stronger relationships, greater confidence. But products do not focus on those issues at all. The solution will come when producers actually begin to address the ambitious and important matters that adverts have so far merely known how to identify. Instead of asking how can we get people to buy a phone or a watch they have made, businesses should be seeking to create goods and services that really do help people find companionship, from and maintain strong families, be more courageous and cope better with the fear of missing out. These are the things &#8211; as the advertisers already understand &#8211; that we all really want.</p>
<p>In most adverts, the pain and the hope of our lives have been superbly identified, but the product is almost comically at odds with them. Manufacturers are hardly to blame. They are, in fact, the victims of an extraordinary problem of modern capitalism. We long to have strong relationships with our children, we desperately want the generations to feel loyal to one another and get on well. But we have been putting our highest creative efforts into minimising the size of cameras and speeding up the transmission of data. And so we have nothing better to offer ourselves &#8211; in the face of our troubles &#8211; than a slightly larger hand-held screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the big convictions of our times is that the fast food industry is to blame for a considerable number of ills of the modern world. This industry is held to be a vital factor in explaining why there are so many low paid jobs, why obesity is on the rise and why so many high streets have lost their character. They’re also to blame for why the content of the burgers themselves is so low grade in comparison with escalopes of wild salmon or breasts of organic chicken.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210314-mcdonaldsA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4191" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210314-mcdonaldsA.jpg?resize=635%2C428" alt="Earns McDonalds" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems natural to point the finger of blame for this, and many other sorry states of affairs, at big corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, in truth, there is an unexpected, and more important, cause of dispiriting jobs, garish signage, environmental abuse and troubling ingredients: our taste. Collectively, it is we, the consumers, who opt for certain kinds of ease and excitement over others. And once that basic fact is in place, everything else follows in the slipstream. It’s not companies that primarily degrade the world. It is our appetites, which they merely serve.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7841881384_6d69f688d8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9730" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7841881384_6d69f688d8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7841881384_6d69f688d8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people who run fast food companies don’t, in their cunning hearts, think that their offerings are ideal, or that the job opportunities they provide are humane. They are not driven by a fixed desire to cook rubbish or create repetitive, stressful low-paid employment. They just want, very badly, to make a profit, but they’d make it anywhere if they could. If we wanted to buy wild salmon or pay a little extra for staff medical insurance, they’d let us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be deeply bothered by poor quality food, exploitative jobs and ugly environments; but in the hugely important task of unleashing a workable social and economic revolution, it matters a great deal where we point the finger of blame. The sobering news is that if all the managers and board members of certain objectionable conglomerates were sacked, similar pathologies of capitalism would spring up again at once.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1">© Ellen Wznick/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t what these businesses are offering, since an offer can always be politely declined; it’s what we are choosing. The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd-sounding, but critical task: the education of the consumer.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Generous, thoughtful, sensitive people are often drawn to the view that we shouldn’t expect economies to ‘grow’. After all, the earth and its resources are limited, so why keep asking for GDP to expand? We don’t need more commercial activity or more businesses. We are destroying the planet fast enough as it is.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2583" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/83499093-635x4232.jpg?resize=635%2C4232" alt="The Effects of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2">According to the environmental story, Capitalism pillages the planet for the sake of producing vast quantities of material possessions, many of which we do not really need and only crave because we are duped by relentless advertising.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2584" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76499180.jpg" alt="Workers Assemble Dolls On Production Line" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The implication is that we need to wind back consumerism in order to improve society and lead better lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It’s understandable if this opinion is widespread. But perhaps the good future depends not on minimising Capitalism but on radically extending it.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, Capitalism should address the full range of needs of mankind as efficiently and effectively as possible. This is not currently happening: despite all the factories, the concrete, the highways and the logistics chains, the economy is as yet far too small and desperately undeveloped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations, Capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs, for sanitation, shelter, food supply and health care. The largest and most successful corporations have been those that satisfied appetites that we would categorise as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs: oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, insurance and banking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2585" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_1.png" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">The pyramid of our needs</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The briefest glance at the pyramid reveals a fascinating possibility: that the future growth of business will lie in an assault on a vast array of needs further up the pyramid, in the areas of love and belonging, esteem and self-actualisation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalists and companies are seemingly – semi-consciously – aware of this issue. The evidence lies in advertising. Advertising almost always tries to sell us stuff with an appeal to our higher needs, by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfilment, authenticity, good relationships and a sense of true achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2586" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scarlett-Johansson1.jpg" alt="Scarlett-Johansson" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, as yet, the corporations who pay for the adverts are not actually devoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked. We get promised friendship or love and end up with a 4×4 or a new barbecue set. Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy; it already trades on all the right fantasies. It’s just that there are as yet very few of the truly right products and services out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, only in the last five minutes of our history have we realised that there are very big business opportunities to be found in friendship. And yet Facebook is still making only a rudimentary contribution to the ideal development of this activity. Similarly, only very recently has there been commercial exploration of the fact that we need to keep secrets, yet feel very drawn to raw, dramatic confession as well. A new app which helps us in this area – https://www.secret.ly/ – is now a very successful business enterprise in Silicon Valley, worth tens of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An organised response to our higher needs is not novel. Religions used to address them. Catholicism, if seen as a business, would be the second largest corporation in the world, bigger than Ford or BP or Samsung. Art galleries and museums shared some of the character of religions and similarly tried to address our higher needs, although their clients tended to be governments and nations rather than individual customers.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bigger than Samsung</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call ‘a business idea’ is at heart just an as yet unexplored need. To trace the future shape of Capitalism, we only have to think of all the needs we have that are, currently, poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no shortage: we need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities. We need help in bringing up children. We need help in calming down at key moments (the cost of our high anxiety and rage is appalling in aggregate). We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace and understanding where we can best deploy them (a service in this area would matter a great deal more to us than pizza delivery). We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires. Elegant town centres, charming high streets and sweet villages are in desperately short supply and are therefore absurdly expensive – just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed but were very rare and only for the very rich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4194" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to do what he did – but in the realm of houses, friendship, anxiety…</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These higher needs are not trivial or minor wants, little things we could easily survive without. They are, in many ways, absolutely central to our lives. We have simply accepted, without really thinking about it, that there is nothing we can do to address them. And yet to be able to structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t know, today, quite what the businesses of the future will look like. Just as in 1975, no one could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google. But we know the direction we need to head to: we need the drive and inventiveness of Capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life. This will offer an exit from the failings and misery that attend Capitalism today. In a nutshell, the problem is that we waste resources on unimportant things. And we are wasteful, ultimately, because we lack self-knowledge, because we are using consumption merely to divert or quieten anxieties or in a vain search for status and belonging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we could just address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained, our work would be more meaningful and our profits would be more honourable. That’s the ideal future of Capitalism.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our society really admires it when rich people give away huge piles of surplus money towards the end of their lives, particularly when they donate large sums of it to the arts. It seems so noble and so good. What nice capitalists they are. How grateful we should be to have them in our midsts!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recognition, sometimes these rich donors have a gallery named after them where their masterpieces hang, dinners are given in their honour and the odd title may be thrown their way. They really seem wonderful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2574" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyA.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1">This big capitalist made lots of money in shopping malls; now he has given lots of it to preserve beautiful jugs in elegant glass cases</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take for instance Nasser David Khalili, one of the world’s richest men. Iranian born, resident in London, he amassed a fortune – in the many billions – building and selling shopping malls in far flung and rather challenging locations. His money safely accumulated, he has now begun to give away large chunks of it to philanthropic causes. As with many rich people, his dominant interest is art: the greatest share of his surplus wealth has been directed towards the acquisition and display of masterpieces in a variety of genres. He has sponsored exhibitions at the Hermitage in St Petersburg and the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris: he has given large sums to Oxford University and lent his art collection, revolving around Islamic masterpieces, to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its combination of money-making and art, Khalili’s trajectory follows in the footsteps of great plutocrats like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick or Andrew Mellon. They made money in so-called ‘low’ areas of the economy; like coal mining, railways, abattoirs, and packing factories – areas where you squeeze costs as tightly as you can and are always looking to reduce benefits as much as possible. However, once the money is in the bank, these rich people wholeheartedly turn their attention to ‘higher’ causes – among which art (and all that it celebrates, like kindness, beauty and tenderness) looms especially large.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-140314-moneyB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4196" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-140314-moneyB.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="PM-140314-moneyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Henry Clay Frick: made a fortune from abusing the efforts of thousands of steel workers, then built an art gallery full of fine and tender things:</span></h5>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Blackened faces and bent backs helped to bring about this moment</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We suggest a different path. It’s not ideal to ignore the higher needs of mankind for many decades while pulling together an astonishing fortune and then, later in life, suddenly to rediscover these higher needs via an act of immense generosity towards some localised little shrine of art (an opera house or a museum). Would it not be better and truer to the values underlying many works of art, to strive throughout the course of one’s life, especially within the money-generating day-job, to make kindness, tenderness, sympathy and beauty more alive and real in the world?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tantalisingly and tragically, the difference between beauty and ugliness, goodness and cruelty is in most enterprises a few percentage points of profit. Therefore, for the sake of just a tiny bit of surplus wealth, wealth that isn’t strictly even needed, human life is daily being degraded and sacrificed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Would it not be more humane if rich business people agreed to sacrifice a little of their surplus wealth in their main area of activity and in the most vigorous period of their lives, in order to render the workplace more noble and humane – and then bothered less with dazzling displays of artistic philanthropy in their later decades? Would it not have been better for all of us if rather than making money through selling Scotland’s hideous Cameron Toll shopping centre only then to give a portion of the cash away to the Hermitage Museum, Mr Khalili had made slightly less money, but done so through building beautiful shops and houses that could have enhanced the tenor of everyday life across the modern world?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we’re asking for is enlightened investment where a lower return is sought on capital in the name of Kindness and Goodness. There would be less fancy art at the end of it, but the values within works of art would be far more widely spread across the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2577" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyD.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ugliness sponsors beauty: The profits from here ended up helping the Hermitage museum</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason why the present system survives has to do with the way status is offered. This is a key part of the jigsaw and we ignore it at our peril. The rich currently get a huge amount of status from making big philanthropic donations to the arts. However, they would get no respect – indeed only pity and disbelief – if they claimed to be limiting their wealth-making potential by running their businesses in ways that made daily life slightly nicer for employees and society. There is more status to be found in exploiting mines, rainforests and call centres with ruthless abandon for three decades then, your animal energies having run dry, putting on a black tie jacket and funding an opera house or museum of 17th century still-life from the proceeds. This strategy has to it a glamour far greater than the infinitely more humane and therefore in the deep sense ‘artistic’ task of steadily building a more agreeable world for people at a modest 3% annual rate of return, which at the end of life, leaves you little except for the inherent satisfaction of having done something worthwhile with your years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlightened Capitalism requires new kinds of patrons interested in making money, but willing to sacrifice returns for the sake of higher goals. Take London’s Regent’s Park and Regent’s Street. They are both beautifully elegant and brilliantly commercial developments. People like to visit them even now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2578" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyE.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might learn from the attitude of the guy who built them, the Prince Regent, later George IV. The Prince had more than one motive for the huge scheme. Certainly he wanted and needed some money from leasing the new buildings. So there was a Capitalist base to the project. But he also wanted to make a fine and permanent contribution to the beauty and grandeur of his capital city – and was prepared to take a huge hit on his profit levels to guarantee this. He succeeded in both aims.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The rich are a product of capitalism, but they are ideally suited to correct some of the problems: They can afford to take some of the risks to get capitalism to address our higher needs &#8211; w<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">hich means bearing risk (rather than simply writing off the money (which is the idea of philanthropy). Profitability should be the eventual goal and is important because it i</span></strong>s a signal that enough people value something that they have become ready to pay for it: it is a sign that one has worked out how to get the value of the product authentically into people’s lives.</p>
<p class="p1">Rather than idolise or excoriate the rich, we should work out what private wealth good is for. If there are going to be rich people, what role should they ideally be playing? And what would potentially be missing in a society where no-one as rich? At the moment the rich tend to be seen as having to two duties to society: poverty alleviation and art philanthropy. These ways of giving back to society can seem, at first, rather nice. But they run up against serious problems. Even though a rich individual has &#8211; of course &#8211; a huge amount of money in comparison with most people, they are still puny in comparison with the scale of the issue. Their resources won’t go far. Someone with a billion pounds could give GBP 15 to each person in the UK &#8211; or 13p to everyone on the planet. It would be an astonishing gesture, but would produce no lasting benefit. Poverty alleviation is really important but an individual giving away their money can’t solve it. It requires the actions of the state.</p>
<p class="p1">As for artistic patronage: Art is surely a lovely thing. But even more valuable are the sort of things that the works of art we love celebrate: kindness, empathy, goodness, beauty. At the end of the day, it is far better that these qualities have more of a place in our offices and factories than that we add yet another museum or ‘masterpiece’ to the nation’s collection. It’s far closer to the real spirit of art to run a factory that’s attractive, to be kind to workers, and to treat colleagues well than to bully, fight and exploit for a lifetime, then give a Renoir to the National Gallery in one’s last years.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2579" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyF.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t buy the picture and give it to the nation; try to make the sweetness and kindness in the picture more possible in day to day life (for example, by giving workers more time off to be with their families)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s late and, across the nation, people are sinking back into the soft corners of sofas, clutching glasses of wine and TV remote controls and numbing their minds with soothing images and sounds. The working day is done. Everyone has earned a break.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/commuters.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4198" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/commuters.jpg?resize=635%2C388" alt="Commuters Struggle With Over Crowding On Train Routes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a few people are still hard at work. They are at their desks making their way through labyrinths of documents, sifting columns of figures, hammering out emails, taking calls and struggling to master waves of exhaustion and anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3330" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/450616087.jpg" alt="Obama Speaks At Wall Street Journal CEO Council Annual Meeting" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are the rich. Rupert Murdoch labours night and day. Gina Rinehart (the wealthiest woman in the world) is fanatically industrious. Warren Buffett is still hard at it. Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, puts in massive hours. So does Jamie Dimon at the helm of JP Morgan Chase. Their frenzied labours are one of the strangest – but most significant – sights of modern Capitalism. Those who are already wealthy keep their noses firmly to the grindstone. And not just these few titans, but the hundreds and thousands of less well known but also highly successful entrepreneurs, the guiding spirits and great beneficiaries of the modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do the rich of today keep on working? Why do they enter stressful negotiations, constantly take on large risks, battle ambitious, hard-hearted rivals, and scheme and plot until the day they collapse? What are they doing it for? Why aren’t they satisfied with the extensive assets and large piles of money they already have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2595" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/billgates1.jpg" alt="GHANA-US-AID-HEALTH-PEOPLE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© AFP/Getty Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t the money</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rich are not, therefore, working to make more money with an eye to spending it. They are making money in order to be liked. They are doing so for the sake of status, as a way of keeping score and letting the world know of their value as human beings. The rich work for love and for honour. They stay up late at the office out of vanity – because they want to be able to walk into rooms full of strangers and be swiftly recognised by those that matter and deemed miraculous and clever for having made fortunes, whose size is carefully recorded by the media the world over.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many cases, this works out well for everyone. There is often no conflict between the insatiable vanity of corporate chiefs and the requirements of society. That is one of the miracles of Capitalism, first observed by Adam Smith: the system can put personal selfishness to work for the public good. Capitalism doesn’t have to rely on kindness or virtue, which makes it infinitely more robust than rival economic arrangements, the kind that explicitly demand that those in charge have pure hearts (Communism). Under certain circumstances, corporations driven only by the profit motive can pass two key tests: they can treat their employees extremely well and they can produce excellent goods and services. Private vice can give rise to public virtue: companies can pay thousands of workers handsome salaries and fill shops across nations with wholesome necessary goods – and at the same time, the CEO’s at the helm may be deeply unpleasant, asocial and narcissistic types who pay not even one passing thought to the genuine needs of the societies they in fact serve so well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s how it should work. But sadly, too often, it no longer does. Under the pressure of the raw profit motive, two things are happening: workers are increasingly abused (their salaries and conditions are reduced to an inhumane minimum) and the quality of products is grievously undermined (corners are cut, false claims are made, the best promises of the company are sacrificed). And paradoxically, all this unhappiness flows from one cause only: the need to continue filling the bank accounts of people who don’t – as we’ve learnt – truly even want money for its own sake, people who only want money to be loved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surveying the problems of Capitalism, the standard response of the left has been to suggest that one simply tax the rich more. But this fails to grasp, and therefore properly to exploit, the real psychological motives of the rich. The rich only pursue money fanatically (to our great collective cost) because wealth appears to be the primary, most objective source of honour in the modern world. If only we can fix how honour is obtained, we will be able to redirect their mania to more socially beneficial ends in ways that don’t demand that the rich become ‘nice’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, a natural inclination is to force the rich to give up their wealth using the instrument of new taxes, but this strategy simply won’t work. The chances of people running away and taking their assets with them is too great. We know that entrepreneurial energy and competitive drive can too easily be depleted; the economic balloon can deflate and all will suffer. We need to go down a different route. We need to harness the talents and drives that the rich are currently using to squeeze the earth and its people too hard – and ensure that these energies are made to address  the collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim should be to seduce the rich – to make them want to benefit their societies in return for giving them what (we know) they deep down really want but haven’t until now reliably been able to get except through money: namely, honour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2596" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-193314661.jpg" alt="Obama Medal of Honor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">There are few motives as powerful as the desire for honour</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough that societies can motivate people very powerfully through honour: soldiers will perform extraordinary feats on the battlefield in return for the highest gratitude from their countries (they don’t even ask to be paid very much – paid to die…). Scientists will labour in poverty for decades in the hope of winning a Nobel Prize. Yet as societies, we are only just beginning to explore what good can come out of vanity in the realm of business. In the commercial world, there are at present no systematic, fail-safe methods for gaining status in return for doing what society desperately needs capitalists to do: treat their workers well and produce useful, safe, environmentally-sound goods and services. In some countries, there may be the odd hope of a medal from the president or the queen if one behaves well, but the chances of securing one are simply too remote and unpredictable to motivate hard-headed capitalists in their actions from day to day: it remains far more rational to peg one’s hopes for status on the verifiable criterion of money than on the vague chance of an invitation from the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is precisely what needs to be changed – and urgently. Society should do a systematic deal with capitalists: it should give them the honour and love they so badly crave in exchange for treating their workers as human beings, not abusing customers and properly looking after the planet. A standard test should be drawn up to measure the societal good generated by companies (many such schemes already exist in nascent form), on the basis of which capitalists should then be given extraordinarily prestigious titles by their nations in ceremonies with the grandeur and thrill of film premieres or sporting finales. It might be something to go after their names (for example, RC: Responsible Capitalist), a title that would have some of the same associations as the Nobel Prize, the Victoria Cross and the Pulitzer prize – in other words, a fitting target for the most ambitious and narcissistically craven and damaged people in society to strive for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/obe1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4200" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/obe1.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="Royal Investitures" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Martin Mills, chairman of music company Beggars Group, being given an OBE. This should happen a lot more often, and far more systematically</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The founding figure of modern economics, Adam Smith, adroitly recognised the two chief motivating factors in human life: the love of riches and the love of glory. He knew that these two things are what people ultimately want and what they work hardest for.  A wise society must therefore learn how to harness the love of glory at times, like now, when the public good comes into conflict with the love of riches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need the energy of the entrepreneurs, we need their drive and their determination. But if these business people continue to be motivated by unchecked profit alone, we will all go to ruin. Matters have become unsustainable, the disparities and absurdities too great. To solve the problem, we don’t have to wait until the rich miraculously grow magnanimous or kind. And we’ll be sure to have no luck trying to impose new taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdamSmith-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4202" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdamSmith-1.jpg?resize=635%2C607" alt="AdamSmith-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">He knew, you have to give them gongs and ribbons</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, wise societies that have properly understood the psychology of the rich now have a trump card to play. As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</span></p>
