<p>We often think of being a success primarily in status and financial terms. But being a success just means doing anything well, and there are so many different goals we might actually choose to be successful at, once we break away from the dominant status ideals of our societies.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He looks like an ordinary guy. He could be the taxi driver who took you to the airport, a maths teacher or the manager of a gym.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2950" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageA.jpg" alt="Media Summit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, he’s one of the richest and most powerful people who has ever lived. Co-founder and current CEO of Google, he has a personal wealth of upwards of $20 billion and a profound role in shaping the modern world. Just into his forties, he may still only be at the early stages of his career.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4211" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageB.jpg?resize=635%2C543" alt="PM-200214-pageB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Just a nice guy</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The down-beat, casual personal style seems endearing. How nice that he’s not at all pompous. But those jeans and T-shirt signal something deeply disturbing and cause us immense underlying psychological problems. By stressing how average he is, Larry projects the idea that it is within the reach of everyone to be like him. If you’re not a multi-billionaire by the time you are forty, there might be something wrong with you. Through his manner, Larry tells us implicitly: one of the world’s largest, most powerful and respected corporations is being run by an ordinary down-to-earth guy. That message has a nasty sting in the tail: it might be abnormal to be you, who also looks so ordinary but, sadly, has no corporation in the background. This is pretty devastating. Larry is a great business leader in many ways. But, without meaning to, he has hugely damaged our pride.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2952" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageC.jpg" alt="PM-200214-pageC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world presents itself as egalitarian – and it is, in the sense that, in principle, people can come from any background and get to the highest positions. It’s just that, in practice, most people almost always don’t get very far. It’s the way of the world. There are more ambitions than there are glorious destinies. We are the victims of class, genes, biology, bad luck and our own lack of inspiration and confidence. We are told repeatedly that we are free to succeed. What is less often stressed is the way social mobility works both ways: we are also free to fail – but when we do so, we can blame only ourselves for our mediocrity. We are, to use that crushing word, losers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a new kind of agony, this status anxiety. In the past people at the very top went to great lengths to show how different they were from everyone else and how inconceivable it was that you could ever get to be like them. Their clothes, habits, ways of life were utterly distinctive. They made it clear that they were not normal in any way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4213" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageD.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Portrait of Louis XIV of France" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span class="s1">Louis XIV was not like you</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Louis XIV of France liked to wander about in ermine cloaks and gold brocade coats. He carried a golden stick. He sometimes donned a suit of armour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4214" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageE.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Portrait of Louis XIV of France" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was all very haughty and unfair, of course. But it did have one great advantage. You could not possibly think you could get to the top and be like Louis. You couldn’t envy the king, because envy involves thinking it is theoretically possible to secure what the envied person has already got.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not trying to tell Larry Page to put on a golden suit or carry a sceptre. He can keep wearing the jeans, but we – his viewers – should appreciate what problems all this causes us. We need to work on greater compassion for ourselves. It’s hard to live in modern times when the rich and powerful often look just like us. Unexpectedly, we all pay a price in anxiety, every day, for those wardrobe choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2956" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageF.jpg" alt="Earns Google" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p4"><span class="s1">Not, in fact, a chirpy lighting technician about to be fired by a provincial theatre director</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Despite good intentions, modern societies are profoundly unequal. Yet contemporary culture encourages the feeling that in crucial ways, everyone is, in fact, on the same footing. Not in terms of current possessions and status, but in terms of potential. Today, you may be short of cash, low on prestige and bruised by rejection. But these are – so it’s insinuated – transient troubles. Hard work, a positive attitude and a couple of bright ideas can fix the issue in due course. There are always some encouraging stories circulating: for example, of the guy who trailed around South America for five years not doing very much of anything, then came back home and started a business making sportswear that got sold for just short of a billion. Or the woman who made a fortune with a retail recommendation app created in her kitchen.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2396" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1603649-1.jpg" alt="The Hamptons in the Summer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">© Getty</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, the thought that someone somewhere had some great asset you lacked (a business, a prestigious job etc.) would have felt like an impersonal fact, with no bearing on your inner life, because there was no possible route from where most people were to the possession of such a thing – anymore than a peasant could hope to become a knight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cleric-Knight-Workman1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4209" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cleric-Knight-Workman1.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="Cleric-Knight-Workman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where it doesn’t feel like there’s a possibility, there is no envy</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the spirit of modern society is one of intense equality, which is a torture in terms of envy, for when egalitarian ambitions circulate in societies that tell themselves that anyone can do anything, the experience of envy goes into over-drive. We don’t envy everyone, we do so only when we think their advantages are within our reach. So when almost everything feels like it could be ours (but a lot never can be), the opportunities for envy grow dangerously large.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, our society both generates untold quantities of envy and also (in a strange hang-over from the Judeo-Christian past) seems to condemn anyone who might admit to experiencing the emotion too intensely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-069.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4205" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-069.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="06-069" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sufferers of envy suffering eternal torments in hell, according to Dante in the Divine Comedy</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, to feel embarrassed by our envious feelings risks encouraging us to repress them – and therefore, to lose out on deriving some hugely important lessons from them. While envy is deeply uncomfortable, squaring up to the emotion is an indispensable requirement of a decent life. It is a call to action that should be heeded, for it contains garbled messages sent by confused but important parts of our personalities about what we should be doing with the rest of our lives. Without regular envious attacks, we couldn’t possibly know what we wanted to be. Instead of trying to repress our envy, we should hence make every effort to study it. Each person we envy possesses a piece of the jigsaw puzzle depicting our possible future. There is a portrait of a ‘true self’ waiting to be assembled out of the envious hints we receive when we flick through a magazine, turn the pages of a newspaper or hear updates on the radio about the career moves of old schoolmates. We should calmly ask one essential and redemptive question of all those we envy: ‘What could I learn about here?’</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Full of clues as to our future selves</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we are extremely bad students of envy. We start to envy certain individuals in their entirety, when in fact, if we took a moment to analyse their lives calmly, we would realise that it was only a small part of what they had done that really resonates with, and should guide, our own next steps.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might not be the whole of the restaurant entrepreneur’s life we want, but really just their skill at building up institutions. Or we might not truly want to be a potter (when we think more closely about it), and yet we might need a little more of the playfulness on display in the work of one example we read about in a Sunday supplement. What we’re in danger of forgetting is that the qualities we admire don’t just belong to one specific, very attractive life. They can be pursued in lesser, weaker (but still real) doses in countless other places, opening up the possibility of creating many smaller, more manageable and more realistic versions of the lives we desire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we have sucked all the goodness from envy, we also have to acknowledge that there will be limits to its benefits. We need to know both how to use it and at other points, how to quieten its pangs. Too many random reminders of other people’s success too soon may simply terrify us into inactivity and unwittingly prevent us from putting any single plan into practice. We leap from target to target without knowing how to focus. In order to achieve anything on our own, we need to be free for extended stretches from the psychological pressures exerted by news of others’ feats. We require periods of inner seclusion and calm if we are ever going to finish off something worthwhile, that is, something that we may ourselves one day be envied for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to be able to postpone competition, to the moment when it can properly challenge us, rather than simply crush us. The student at a creative writing class who envies Hemingway or Nabokov is not going to be helped by the full intensity of the comparison between their writings and those of these masters. We need stretches of constructive inferiority – time to assess the scale of the mountain and to begin climbing with steady concentration. Envious rivalry, if it breaks in too soon, produces only despair and distraction.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlikely to be helpful if envy of them strikes too intensely in the first term</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also need to remind ourselves of statistical realities, because exposure to the media encourages us to forget them constantly. While the supplements are continuously filled with success stories, success itself will always remain highly anomalous, achieved by no more than a few thousand out of many millions – a detail that the media carefully (and sadistically) keeps carefully out of our imaginations. In contrast to what it suggests, most businesses in fact fail, most films don’t get made, most careers are not stellar, most people’s faces and bodies are less than perfectly beautiful and almost everyone is sad and worried a lot of the time. Mediocrity is the human norm. We shouldn’t lament our own condition just because it doesn’t measure up against deeply unrealistic benchmarks, or hate ourselves solely for our inability to defy some breathtaking odds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/450732904.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5119" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/450732904.jpg?resize=635%2C542" alt="World Premiere Of Disney's &quot;Maleficent&quot;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">About as likely as being struck by lightning</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another crucial strategy – to lessen the grip in which envy holds us – is to understand more accurately and fully what the success of others depends upon. Perhaps these envied figures are not as much like you as they seem to be. Your sense of equality – responsible for much of your agony – may be misplaced. When you meet the target of your envy at a party or see them in jeans in a glossy magazine, they do of course seem very ‘normal’ and dangerously like you. But, in fact, they may have a highly unusual brain adept at synthesising vast amounts of financial data in ingenious ways. They might have a PhD in mechanical engineering. Or they are driven to work eighteen hours a day. Or they have a ruthless streak, which you are fundamentally not capable of or interested in. An anti-equality argument stresses that success often comes down to a raft of qualities which one has forgotten one doesn’t possess. The haunting thought – why them, why not me? – should therefore no longer invite simply self-torture and panic. It should instead edge us towards admiration. There are in truth real differences between oneself and the envied person. One isn’t really their equal. It isn’t just laziness, bad luck or some kind of persecutory force that explains our situation. We may arrive at the sane realisation that, when viewed dispassionately, certain accomplishments are truly beyond us. We can become appreciative spectators, rather than disappointed rivals, of those who have accomplished great things.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Typically, envious feelings swirl around unexamined. We carry them about guiltily but blindly. This gives rise to outbursts of bad temper directed at innocent bystanders (especially one’s partner); the sneaking hope that something bad is going to befall the person we envy and a sullen sense that one’s life is second-rate. But rather than repress the experience of envy, we should undertake a Philosophical Exercise to a) focus it and b) lend it perspective.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4216" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia.jpg?resize=635%2C375" alt="Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things, Jheronimus Bosch, 1500</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exercise below needs about 10 minutes to carry out. The questions and tasks are prompts. They’re not all going to be relevant. They won’t cure envy in one swoop. But they seek to reduce its trauma and start us on the path of dealing better with a powerful and difficult feature of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step One: Acknowledgement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s so unpleasant to admit to envy, we rarely do it head on, even to ourselves. Therefore, under the heading I admit I am envious of  …, make a list of the people who have recently triggered the emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woman who lives in that house in Well Walk</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gina (at the tennis club)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blunt declaration can be deeply freeing in itself. It is an admission, counter to neo-Christian moralism, that one is daily riven by envy and that this is profoundly normal, and even a sign of health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Two: Accuracy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For each person, write down the obvious immediate reason why their life seems to be terrific:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: read about him in the newspaper this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A: seems to have some big job in TV.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: has 250 shops around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it can seem as if we want to be exactly like the person we envy. We want to have their life, pure and simple. And yet our circumstances, aptitudes and needs are likely to be extremely different from their own, even though we do still need to learn something from them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try to identify one or more reasons why it would be odd, impossible or even quite undesirable for you actually to be the person you envy:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: I am not an actor and would hate to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A.: I hate the world of TV.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: I have no interest in communications businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But your envy isn’t crazy. There is something real that you are latching on to, it’s just a question of pinning it down a little more accurately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So now look again at the names on your list, and try to find a small but significant thing that it is genuinely realistic to admire and to want to learn from:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: he has managed to be popular and cheerful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A.: she seems decisive and unburdened by anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: the idea of being creative for oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You should now have converted a PERSON into a set of ADJECTIVES:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: popular/cheerful</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A: unanxious, decisive</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: creative, independent</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Three: Picturing your future Self</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask yourself what you would need to do to infuse your present life with the qualities you have identified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Complete the following sentence with all the people on your list:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From [person X] I envy, I could realistically learn…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resist the impulse to denigrate those you envy. Settle into the position of a student of your own envy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Four: Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels like you are deeply equal to the people you envy. But in what way are you not in fact their equal? What genuine qualities do they have which you lack?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fill in the following sentence:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels like I am equal to X because… (I am the same age/gender/nationality…)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I am not equal to X because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions/tasks</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Every life is incomplete: what do you think the people you envy might envy?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What do you think are the statistical chances of accomplishing what the person you envy has accomplished? How common is this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Imagine turning envy into admiration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- In what way is it reasonable enough that you might not have got this thing, given how things are…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Imagine someone who likes you describing how you are OK, even quite admirable, without the thing they envy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Name as many things as you can that you craved in the past and then acquired, but which failed to improve your life as much as you had anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Contemplate one of these images of planets far from our own:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Italian luxury car maker Ferrari has unveiled its newest supercar. Named the Ferrari California, it will cost 153,000 GBP and have a maximum speed of 200mph. It is powered by a mighty 3.8 litre twin turbo-charged V8 engine which produces 560 horse-power – equivalent to nearly six Ford Fiestas – and will accelerate from zero to 62mph in just 3.6 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to be sarcastic at this point. We know, because we hear it so often, that we live in a crazily materialistic society where people buy luxury goods because they are greedy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariB-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4218" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariB-1.jpg?resize=635%2C352" alt="PM-240214-ferrariB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">A sign of distress, not greed</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this is far from being true. The motivation is in fact, in general, more emotional and touching. We invest in luxuries because we want people to be nice to us. We live in a world of snobs, where we are treated nicely in so far as we can show quite quickly that we are ‘doing well’, and we are ignored and patronised when we aren’t able to demonstrate rank and power. It isn’t the luxury goods we want, so much as the kindness they are a conduit to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most commonly asked question in a new social encounter is: ‘What do you do?’ And according to how you answer this, people are either incredibly pleased to see you, or abandon you as if you were plague-ridden. The company of the snobbish has the power to sadden and unnerve because we sense how little of who we are deep down – that is, how little of who we are outside of our status – will be able to govern their behaviour towards us. We may be endowed with the wisdom of Solomon and have the resourcefulness and intelligence of Odysseus, but if we are unable to wield socially recognised badges of our qualities, our existence will remain a matter of raw indifference to them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariC1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4219" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariC1.jpg?resize=635%2C352" alt="3513225a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">People will be nice to babies, whatever their behaviour, even without status symbols</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This conditional attention pains us because our earliest memory of love is of being cared for in a naked, impoverished condition. Babies cannot, by definition, repay their carers with worldly rewards. In so far as they are loved and looked after, it is for who they are: identity understood in its most stripped-down state. They are loved for, or in spite of, their uncontrolled, howling and stubborn characters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be tempting to laugh at those who buy luxury goods. But before ridiculing these types, it would perhaps be fairer to wonder about the wider context in which their ‘showing off’ takes place. Rather than teasing the buyers, we may blame the society in which they live for setting up a situation where the purchase of absurdly overpriced brands feels psychologically necessary and rewarding; where respect has become dependent on a fancy lifestyle. Next time you encounter someone driving a Ferrari, assume not that the driver is greedy, but that he or she is extremely vulnerable to insult and to being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2782" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-240214-ferrariD.jpg" alt="PM-240214-ferrariD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The existence of the luxury goods industry is testimony to a trauma. It is the result of hundreds of thousands of people who feel pressured by the fear of the coldness of others to add an extraordinary amount to their bare selves in order to signal that they too may lay a claim to love. It is fuelled by people who feel (and they’re not wrong) that their chances of being treated with respect will increase if they take the extra precaution of acquiring a high powered job, a Ferrari, a Chanel bag, a Montcler jacket, an Omega watch and an Oswald Boateng suit.</span></p>
