<h5>Xu Zhen’s Supermarket</h5>
<p>The Shanghai-based artist Xu Zhen is one of the most celebrated Chinese artists of our age. He operates in a variety of media, including video, sculpture and fine art. His work displays a deep interest in business; he appears alternately charmed and horrified by commercial life. In recent years, he has become especially fascinated by supermarkets. He’s interested, in part, by how lovely they can be.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9135" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image05.png?resize=496%2C334" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xu Zhen loves the alluring packaging, the feel of lifting something off a shelf and seeing multiple versions of it waiting just behind and the exquisite precision with which items are displayed. He particularly likes the claim that supermarkets can provide us with everything we could possibly need; the claim of comprehensiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Xu Zhen feels there’s something really quite wrong with real supermarkets &#8211; and commercial life in general. The actual products they sell often aren’t the things we genuinely need. The backstories of the things on sale is often exploitative, everything has been carefully calculated to get us to spend more than we mean to. There’s cynicism throughout the system.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in response, the Chinese artist mocks the supermarket repeatedly. In his work, the products on the shelves look real, you’re invited to pick them up, but then you find out they are empty, as physically empty as Xu Zhen feels they are spiritually empty. His checkouts are similarly deceptive. They seem genuine: but you get a receipt and it turns out to be a fake; you’ve bought ‘nothing’ of value.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket installation takes us on a journey: at first it is getting us to share the artist’s excitement around supermarkets and then it&#8217;s puncturing the illusion: it’s all a big, deliberate let down: the products look tempting but they are full of nonsense and don’t really nourish us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s highly significant that Xu Zhen’s critique of supermarkets is ironic. We tend to get ironic around things that we feel disappointed by but don’t feel we’ll ever be able to change. It’s a manoeuvre of disappointment stoically handled. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9136" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image07.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of art is ironic in its critiques of capitalism; we’ve come to expect this. It playfully hints at what is wrong but has no real clue what to do in response. A kind of hollow sad laughter seems the only fitting response. Criticism melts into irony.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/XuZhen2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9140" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/XuZhen2.jpg?resize=500%2C333" alt="XuZhen2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xu Zhen is trapped in the paradigm of what an artist does. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">artist, we have come to suppose &#8211; and the current ideology of the art world insists &#8211; couldn’t be enthusiastic about improving a supermarket. He or she could only mock from the sidelines. We’ve nowadays fortunately loosened definitions of what a ‘real’ man or woman is meant to do, but there are still strict social taboos hemming in the idea of what an artist is allowed to get up to: they can be as experimental and surprising as they like … unless they want to run a supermarket or an airline or an energy corporation &#8211; at which point they cross a decisive boundary, fall from grace, lose their special status as artists and become the supposed polar opposites: mere business people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d like to take Xu Zhen seriously, perhaps more seriously than he takes himself. Beneath the irony, Xu Zhen has the ambition to discover what an ideal supermarket might be like, how it might be a successful business and how capitalism could be reformed. Somewhere within his project, he carries a hope: that a corporation like a supermarket could be brought into line with the best values of art: psychological and spiritual importance, kindness and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p>Thousands of miles away from Shanghai, in the flatlands of East Anglia in the northeastern tip of Southern England, just outside of Norwich, lies a hugely impressive modern building completed in 1978 by the architect Norman Foster. The Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts is filled with some of the greatest works of contemporary art: here we find masterpieces by Henry Moore, Giacometti and Francis Bacon.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9138" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/museum-of-the-year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9139" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/museum-of-the-year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="museum-of-the year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection is made possible thanks to the enormous wealth of the Sainsbury family, which owns and runs Britain’s second largest supermarket chain that bears its name. Discounted shoulders of lamb, white bread and special 3 for 2 offers on tangerines have led to exquisite display cases containing Giacometti’s elongated, haunting figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gallery seems guided by values that are light years from any actual supermarket. It is feeding your soul, the curators are deeply ambitious about the emotional and educational benefit of the experience: they want you to come out slightly improved. A visit is a special occasion (though they hope you’ll come often).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a very different direction, the Sainsbury family arrive at a strikingly similar conclusion to Xu Zhen. Art and supermarkets are essentially opposed. And like Xu Zhen, the Sainsbury&#8217;s are caught in an identity trap, though a very different one: that of the philanthropist. The philanthropist is imagined as someone who makes a lot of money in the brutish world of commerce and then makes a clean break. They devote their wealth to projects that are studiedly non-commercial. The philanthropist fears that if they ever took an art-loving attitude to their businesses they would suffer economic collapse. Instead of making big things happen in the real world, they would become mere artists who make little interesting things that live only in the sheltered, subsidised world of the gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a strangely tantalising situation. The artist finds something loveable and much that’s wrong around supermarkets, but can’t imagine running one and bring the ideals of art into action in that arena. The supermarket owners love art, but can’t imagine bringing their art-loving side into focus in their business.  They are both like pioneers, at the edges of unexplored territory. There is a huge idea they are both circling round. The goal is a synthesis of business and art: a supermarket that was truly guided by the ideals of art, capitalism that is compatible with higher values.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supermarket governed by the values of art would not be selling art. It would be a genuine supermarket continuing to sell all the things we use everyday; it would still be focused on the idea that you can go round with a huge trolley and stock up on pretty much everything you require for the coming week. But it would be paying attention to the things that the arts have traditionally valued highly: sincerity, a focus on higher (as well as lower) needs, sympathy for the weak and the poor, a focus on quality and authenticity. The arts have a deeply impressive record of getting people to like things which, initially, didn’t seem at all attractive at first. At their best, they normalise and glamorise what is good. Supermarkets have a great (but currently misused) ability to make these moves. They have normalised lychees and glamorised cold-pressed olive oil. They could do the same for the idea of a just price: items which are slightly more expensive than their rivals because they have been produced under better conditions for all concerned. Or the idea of quality over quantity: one buys a smaller but better portion of cheese, a smaller but better chicken, fewer but better cherries&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, stacking shelves in a supermarket is one of the less sought after jobs: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pic_international_large_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9141" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pic_international_large_3.jpg?resize=374%2C210" alt="pic_international_large_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, many people are keen to work in art and in galleries. Some will work for almost nothing, but they are willing because they are proud of their involvement: at parties they feel excited to say that they are working at a gallery even if mainly they are sweeping the store room, keeping the mailing list up to date or perching on a ladder.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a3b145748.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9142" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a3b145748.jpg?resize=635%2C481" alt="a3b145748" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These feel like opposite ends of the spectrum. But all that divides them is the idea of what the work means: we think of apples and soup cans as banal and art as special. The true irony is that works of art are often themselves homages to humble things. Cézanne thought apples were deeply wonderful, which was why he painted them. We get closer to Cézanne not so much by looking at the painting, but by looking at what he looked at &#8211; real apples on a simple table &#8211; with his appreciative eye. A Warhol soup can isn&#8217;t saying soup cans are pitiful but art is wonderful. Its meaning is really the reverse. Art is doing its job when it gets us to love the dignity of ordinary life &#8211; and business is succeeding when it provides the conditions for humane and purpose-driven work. A supermarket run under the values of art would be a glamorous, prestigious place to work: people would feel a quiet surge of pride when they mentioned they worked there.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, we have collectively learned to admire the values of the arts (which can be summed up as a devotion to truth, beauty and goodness, expressed via material things) in the special arena of galleries. But their more important application is in the general, daily fabric of our lives &#8211; the area that’s currently dominated by an often depleted vision of commerce. It’s a tragic polarisation: we encounter the values we need, but only in a rarefied setting while we regard these values as alien to the circumstances where we most need to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to simultaneously raise the ambition of artists: to make their ideals powerful in our lives &#8211; and of business: to serve us better. The two ambitions are ultimately very closely related.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket is one example in the wider class of commercial projects that should, ideally, be run according to the values of art, which could include: financial services, property development or home insurance. These corporations could use the ambitions and ideas that at the moment circle around art to better serve the needs of their customers.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part, what we need to do is get artists out of an ironic mode and equip them with the right skills. We need artists who are good at dealing with employment contracts and balance sheets; who are excited by organisational flow charts and are undaunted by shareholder meetings. At the same time, we need to raise the ambitions of business people, stop them spending their surplus on art, and instead encourage them to invest (for surplus wealth buys you time to make good ideas stick) in making their core activities themselves more in line with the spirit of art. We should be seeking to make money via the values of art, rather making it in disregard for those values, and then funding a museum. That is the challenge for the future.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout history, in most societies, bitter feuds have broken out between two rival camps, ‘business&#8217; on the one hand and ‘the arts’ on the other.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the business camp, have been the traders, manufacturers, entrepreneurs, financiers and the more commercially-minded politicians and scientists. And in the arts camp have been not only painters and sculptors, but also philosophers, poets, playwrights, photographers, novelists, gardeners, psychotherapists, preachers and theologians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hostility between the two camps has been fierce. Back in Ancient China, Confucian scholars regarded commerce as simply a lesser form of human activity.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zhu_xi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9021" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zhu_xi.jpg?resize=345%2C498" alt="Zhu_xi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhu Xi (1130—1200)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business might be necessary, but it was a shameful life in comparison with that of learning and writing. In 18th-century Prussia, under the rule of Frederick the Great, aristocrats were forbidden by law from engaging in mercantile careers &#8211; which were thought to lack the revered military virtues of courage and honour. For the Romantic poets and artists of the 19th century, business seemed wholeheartedly uncouth and tedious.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Montesquiou_Robert_de_-_Boldini.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9022" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Montesquiou_Robert_de_-_Boldini.jpg?resize=635%2C609" alt="Montesquiou,_Robert_de_-_Boldini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To artistic upper class people like the French writer Robert de Montesquiou, the commercial soul seemed obsessed with embarrassing and faintly idiotic things: fluctuations in the price of guano and the search for cheaper ways of transporting cheese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst all the criticism of business by the arts, perhaps one stands out above all: business people have, it has been alleged, been deformed by their love of money; greed has withered their souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has not been enriched by this trench warfare between the arts and business. The two sides would have so much to teach one another if only they could overcome their mutual suspicions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2849400717_a4008b5d59_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9041" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2849400717_a4008b5d59_b.jpg?resize=550%2C621" alt="2849400717_a4008b5d59_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stress on business greed has missed the point. The sort of business people who come in for criticism are not in fact primarily greedy. The more revealing word to use when trying to understand them is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pessimistic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite being on the side of money, many business people have been surprisingly pessimistic about how money can be made, which is what ultimately underpins the activities that have led artists to their denunciations. Hard-headed business people are rarely outright corrupt or unnaturally avaricious: but they very often suffer from a curious kind of melancholy, a particular kind of sadness about the world and its inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem like a strange assertion to make. But this sadness shows itself in six big assumptions that operate beneath the workings of business:  </span></p>
<p><strong>One: Customers won’t give a damn about Workers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great many businesses employ the very cheapest labour they can find on the planet. They negotiate contracts which mean people will have to work in dangerous or uncomfortable factories and warehouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tempting to look at this from the outside and think that it is pure nastiness driving these decisions: employers screw their workers, because they are greedy, but really, it is because they are pessimistic about their customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5790840713_716d130f68_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9039" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5790840713_716d130f68_z.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="5790840713_716d130f68_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalists have a primordial need to stay in business. They are ready to do whatever is compatible with this aim &#8211; and if it turned out that paying staff really well and treating them to long lunch breaks was in line with this ambition, most of them would do so at once without rancour or qualm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they don’t, because of a pessimism about customers. Hard-nosed business people are bleakly sure that very few customers will ever care much about the well-being of their workers. These callous customers won’t give a damn how many eight-year-old children are making their trousers or how much suffering went into harvesting their tea leaves &#8211; and therefore, for businesses to start caring about such issues will simply lead to business failure. After all, the acceptability of price is all in the hands of the audience. It’s not a personal longing on the part of businesses to have people work for as little as possible. The low salaries just stem from a rather pessimistic assumption that unless businesses stick to rock-bottom wages, customers will just go elsewhere and their enterprises will fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses have internalised this idea very profoundly; the customer is essentially selfish.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: Customers have low appetites that can’t be improved</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a deep fear in many areas of business that high-mindedness, earnestness, and complexity are fatal to sales and that any attempt to ‘raise’ the aspirations of consumers in these directions is guaranteed to lose money.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/carteroutdoor.com/images/featured/5197c.121211.jpg?resize=547%2C402" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For example, there’s a pessimism around what would happen if you tried buck the trend and promoted something healthy at the fast-food counter, or made certain magazines a bit more thoughtful or didn’t use a particular celebrity to promote your product. It wouldn’t be greed holding back corporate strategists from undertaking such initiatives. It would be a view of human nature. As the business mantra goes: no one ever failed to make money underestimating the tastes of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Three: The only way to sell is through deception</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a painful background belief that in order to thrive, a business must use advertising to make enormous claims for its rather modest products, and ideally connect them up with semi-conscious, exaggerated promises around success and sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people behind this advert don’t themselves believe that buying a music player is closely connected to the experience of physical intimacy with a gamine beauty or gentle hipster in San Francisco. But they are confronted with some gloomy facts about human nature: that people will as a matter of fact buy music machines if you present them with such images and suggestions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/83644363_9cd7280b59_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9047" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/83644363_9cd7280b59_o.png?resize=400%2C236" alt="83644363_9cd7280b59_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few businesses believe that advertising in its current state is admirable. If they resort to it, it is just from a desolate conclusion seemingly drawn from experience. A company can of course always choose to be above such things but sales will fall, profits will drop, they won’t be able to pay their staff; they won’t be able to raise capital and the whole venture will fold. You can participate in this charade &#8211; or you can be poor.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: You can only make big money from the bottom of the pyramid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a striking fact. Most of the big and most profitable corporations on the planet address needs grouped at the lower levels of Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2000px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9024" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2000px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="2000px-Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses are efficiently targeting basic needs: for shelter, security, communication  and energy. They are engaged in real estate, mining, oil, insurance or transport. None of these industries are currently very focused on any ambitious sense of what happens around their products. The oil company doesn’t care much what your journey is about, so long as you travel a lot; the real estate corporation isn’t concerned with the kind of life you live in your apartment, so long as you pay the rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that people in business simply don’t care about meaning, creativity and the pursuit of self-knowledge. It’s just that they have a pessimistic conviction that it is extremely hard (and almost impossible) to make money from these more elusive and private concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Five: ‘Work’ is the word for what no one would do unless they were paid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a belief at large, infecting the world of business, that work can’t usually be something people will feel deeply engaged by. So awful will the work be, people will just dream about the holidays and retirement. Employees are motivated primarily by money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you want to recruit better staff or get people working more effectively, the key thing is to offer higher salaries. If you want a government agency to run more effectively, privatise it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any other thoughts about why people might work &#8211; in order to improve the lives of others, or to find an outlet for their own better natures &#8211; end up sounding simply naive and hopeless, romantic fantasies at odds with the cold facts of business life.</span></p>
<p><strong>Six: You can’t afford to care about the psychology of your staff</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no reflection of personal indifference to the inner lives of others; it’s just (so many people in business feel) a fairly crucial fact about running an enterprise.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4646164016_3b0efa734a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9052" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4646164016_3b0efa734a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C211" alt="4646164016_3b0efa734a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start getting cosy and concerned about the people who work in your organisation, that’s very nice from a personal point of view, but it takes too much energy and focus away from the harsh (but essential) task of turning a profit. And if you don’t turn a profit, it doesn’t matter how kindly you feel towards your employees, you won’t be able to give them the one thing they actually most want from you: a job. Business requires the softer or more generous aspects of one’s nature to be held in check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is these pessimistic ideas about commerce and work that lead many companies &#8211; and the people who run them &#8211; to appear greedy. But we believe that the decisive factor here isn’t actually greed. It’s a pained vision of life in which any higher aspiration seems at once condemned to failure. A business has no option but to try to turn a profit, and that means it has no option but to operate by certain notions of the demands and psychology of its clients and workers. And this, the argument goes, requires the kind of capitalism we currently have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big claim we are making is that this pessimism is not in fact always warranted and that in order to overcome it, business should look to an unusual source for inspiration: the arts. The arts &#8211; we propose &#8211; possess a welter of antidotes to much of the underlying and painful pessimism of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this antidote has never been explored, it’s no coincidence. It’s because business has some deep suspicions of its own when it comes to the arts. The whole field seems simply utterly useless. When you look round at what really counts in the world, none of it seems to have anything very much to do with the arts. The big corporations are concerned about millions of things &#8211; drilling rights, exchange rates, employment laws, tax credits, regional instability, technological advances. But the arts appear to be entirely marginal to all this. They are just an upmarket area of entertainment, a hobby. You might know of a CEO who paints watercolours to relax; or a wealthy family who subsidise the opera. This isn’t a problem at all. But it shows you where the arts fit in &#8211; you might get involved in the arts, once you have made money. The arts use up money, they don’t make it. Furthermore, though in theory we live in a post-gender era, the arts retain markedly and negatively ‘feminine’ connotations. Business inevitably involves tough choices; it sets a premium on the idea of being strong and masculine. So anything that hints at softness is suspect &#8211; as rendering a person unfit for the key tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, for business, the arts look like something you might get interested </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">once</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you have succeeded. But they can’t help you succeed.</span></p>
<p><b>WHAT THE ARTS CAN OFFER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both sides have, in this arena, been too pessimistic. There’s a way of considering the arts which brings out a hitherto unexplored and highly intriguing degree of value for business.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7887428226_47ab6787db_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9050" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7887428226_47ab6787db_k.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="7887428226_47ab6787db_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right mindset, we can go through the six pessimistic assumptions, one by one, and see alternative &#8211; more optimistic &#8211; attitudes that are systematically available through the history and practice of the arts.</span></p>
<p><strong>One: The skill of exciting Sympathy</strong></p>
<p>Art refuses to believe that humans don’t care about one another. It is extremely ambitious about the possibility of emotional connections between strangers. The whole basis of many artistic works has been the desire to create sympathy where none initially existed.</p>
<p>A primary skill of a good artist is the art of teaching us to see a common humanity beneath the surface anonymity and otherness. In the 19th century, George Eliot saw her primary task as a writer as that of helping us appreciate ‘all that is ordinary in human life’ and attuning us to the minor joys and sorrows of others, down to ‘the squirrel&#8217;s heart beat …’</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_DAlbert_Durade.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9025" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_DAlbert_Durade.jpg?resize=350%2C423" alt="George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_D'Albert_Durade" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Mary Ann Evans (who was published as ‘George Eliot’) extended the reach of sympathy</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middlemarch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teases out the hidden dignity and honour of people living unglamorous lives &#8211; a small scale builder, a very modest farmer, a carpenter, a servant, a poor clergyman. She got large numbers of readers to feel kindly and concerned about these characters; she added new regions to the map of sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her technique didn’t involve telling her readers they ought to care. She didn’t scold. Instead she described people’s lives carefully, feeling that the more we know about how other people are and feel, the more we will care. She was deeply against overt didacticism and lecturing about the plight of the poor. Eliot’s style was ‘psychological realism’, she gave her readers a sense of what it was to be other people, and then let readers come to their own conclusions &#8211; which they have been doing successfully for over a hundred years. </span></p>
<p>One character, in <em>Middlemarch</em>, Caleb Garth works as a surveyor for a new stretch of railway line that’s being planned. He’s not a very impressive figure, he never makes much money and he doesn’t do anything very dramatic. But George Eliot carefully describes how he thinks and feels about his own work and as she does so, our sympathies expand:</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. You must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There&#8217;s this and there&#8217;s that—if I had this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man is—I wouldn&#8217;t give twopence for him&#8221;—here Caleb&#8217;s mouth looked bitter, and he snapped his fingers—&#8221;whether he was the prime minister or the rick-thatcher, if he didn&#8217;t do well what he undertook to do.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Eliot is demonstrating a technique for widening empathy &#8211; namely a realistic presentation of what actually goes through the minds of those who are currently overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Eliot may be one of the most famous writers in the world’s most influential language, but she remains a very small deal on a noisy, distracted planet. Nevertheless, her example justifies a degree of confidence that wider sympathy can be engaged; a sympathy for bricklayers and surveyors, but also garment makers, tea-leaf pickers, fast-food workers and (in case we forget) bankers and CEOs. So, the pessimistic view that customers are selfish &#8211; and can’t care about the workforce, and so won’t bear the costs connected with that care &#8211; isn’t really correct.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: The skill of raising taste</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising taste, means helping people come to a new appreciation of qualities and things that they hadn’t been much interested in before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of culture shows some extraordinary possibilities for getting people to care about new things. For example, up until around 1919 no one had really thought that you could like a painting even though it was completely abstract &#8211; and didn’t try to represent anything.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cri_000000265883.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9026" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cri_000000265883.jpg?resize=470%2C512" alt="cri_000000265883" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then along came Piet Mondrian who created a revolution in taste. He avoided painting trees or sunsets or mothers and babies so as to focus our attention more clearly on some distinctive abstract qualities: harmony, balance, purity. Mondrian was shaping and raising taste: he was assisting his audience to see the attraction and value of things of which they would otherwise have been sceptical. And he was amazingly successful. A painting by Mondrian now costs the price of a small jet aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mondrian didn’t start out with the gloomy idea that everyone is already fixed in their preferences &#8211; and so the only way to sell anything is to go along with the choices people are already making. Otherwise, he would have stayed with the sunsets and babies. He approached public taste with the justified optimism that, in principle and with a bit of time and support, many people can be brought to recognise the appeal of novel (and interesting) things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if this works in relation to lines on a canvas, it must also be able to work in other more important areas than art: in the everyday, immensely significant world of food, cars, hydroelectric turbines, data storage and clothes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Three: You can advertise good things</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business is familiar with the idea of seduction, but it takes a limited view of where seduction can be usefully deployed.  The arts however, have often taken a very positive and ambitious use of seduction. They have used charm to try to ‘sell’ difficult and higher things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient Greeks, for instance, often presented rationality (the potentially austere demand that we think carefully and logically) via the god Apollo. But they made sure that Apollo was a hugely attractive character. He looked like a cross between a model and a football player. His hair was always a tumble of locks. His forearms were strong.</span></p>
<h5><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9027" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5>A classical advert &#8211; for wisdom</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The optimistic assumption here is that we can be enticed towards quite elevated, noble or serious attitudes &#8211; with the help of the right sensory associations. We can be brought to confront difficult and painful &#8211; but important &#8211; tasks if they are introduced in a sufficiently alluring way. The very techniques that could be used to sell bullshit can also be deployed in selling wisdom and self-understanding.</span></p>
<p>The underlying idea is that enthusiasm for good things isn’t just the result of purely rational considerations. We get swayed by beauty, by sexual associations and by charm. We should understand and respond to these facts. Of course they can be abused. But they can also be put to very constructive use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish painter Hammershoi was, in a sense, a businessman. What he wanted to sell us was an attitude of patience, forgiveness and an appreciation of the everyday.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9028" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum.jpg?resize=635%2C633" alt="800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to do this, he understood that he would need to make use of all the arts of advertising. So he seductively used the nape of a lovely female neck, delicate strands of unruly hair, and a carefully calculated angle of the head, to get us to like a person and to want to enter their imaginative world. And once we’re hooked by what is &#8211; to put it bluntly &#8211; sex-appeal, he was confident we could be drawn towards tenderness and intelligent sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moralists in the past &#8211; like the Greek writer of fables Aesop &#8211; realised that in order to make their wise correctives to our bad behaviour palatable, they’d have to use a lot of charm. They’d have to do something pretty close to advertising. Aesop invented droll stories about animals. He was sensitive to the fact that we need to be coaxed into a relaxed and playful frame of mind before we can absorb slightly tricky messages. </span></p>
<p>In one of his stories, Aesop wanted to warn us away from ruining for others what we have no use for for ourselves. So he thought up the story of the Dog in the Manger. He tells us of a dog who invaded the cow shed and set himself up in the feeding trough. He didn’t want to eat the hay himself. But he rigorously stopped the cows eating it too. It’s a charming tale, that makes us laugh, recognise bits of our own natures but doesn&#8217;t make us feel defensive or ashamed; it seduces us into accepting a difficult moral.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fable02steinhowel1521.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9029" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fable02steinhowel1521.jpg?resize=447%2C343" alt="fable02steinhowel1521" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesop, the Greek sculptors and Hammershoi (along with many other artists) have shared an optimistic view of the techniques that nowadays are overwhelmingly used by advertising. They were ambitious about what they could use advertising for. It wasn’t just about trying to get us to buy superfluous shoes or cars: it was also a way of coaxing people to buy into tricky but important things.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: The skill of commodifying higher needs</strong></p>
<p>The arts address the top level of Maslow’s pyramid of needs: they are concerned with the pursuit of meaning and the exploration of individuality and freedom. At certain key moments, the arts have succeeded in commodifying experiences in these areas and turning them into very profitable commercial operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Impressionism &#8211; one of the most commercially successful ventures of all time (if it was a stock, it would be near the very top of most exchanges) &#8211; began when a group of painters living and working around Paris in the 1860s got very excited by the play of light, the delicate tones of shadow and the shimmering reflection of sunshine on water. They had really lovely experiences walking by rivers strolling through gardens and woodland. And they were the first people to work out how to capture those experiences effectively: they did it by focusing not on the actual shapes of thing, but on their own ‘impressions’ &#8211; and by resorting to much brighter colours than Western artist had had recourse to for centuries.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-1897-1899-Monet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9030" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-1897-1899-Monet.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-(1897-1899)-Monet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Impressionists went onto develop this practice as a very profitable industry, which generated considerable wealth for all of the founding figures. Yet, it was a very uncynical process. Monet and his friends Pissarro, Sisley and Renoir simply focused as clearly as they could on the things they loved. They defined and intensified a range of lovely experiences that a lot of people wanted to share. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Poppies-Blooming-Claude-Monet-Landscape-Print.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9031" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Poppies-Blooming-Claude-Monet-Landscape-Print.jpg?resize=400%2C280" alt="Poppies Blooming Claude Monet Landscape Print" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Impressionism was a commercial brand, selling its own special take on happiness</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the pessimistic idea that big profits cluster around lower needs isn’t justified. A useful way of looking at the arts is as a set of businesses directed at our elevated needs. There are enormous commercial possibilities at the top of the pyramid.</span></p>
<p><strong>Five: The skill of motivating a workforce</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cynical &#8211; and pessimistic &#8211; idea is that at heart people only really work for money. The fact is though, across history, people have regularly been touched by other big motivating ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Medieval monks who designed and constructed the buildings on the Scottish island of Iona didn’t have competitive salary packages. They worked because they were motivated by an idea that had been compellingly presented to them: that their labour would be pleasing to God. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iona_2606221b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9032" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iona_2606221b.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="iona_2606221b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And something similar is true of the modern armed forces. People join up not simply because they are going to be paid, but because they are drawn by the idea of serving their country. And they know that this might even come at a terrible price to them. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/british-troops-world-war-i-christmas-truce-soccer-commemoration.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9033" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/british-troops-world-war-i-christmas-truce-soccer-commemoration.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="british troops world war i christmas truce soccer commemoration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The army and the medieval church have a long elaborate tradition of creating motivation and explaining the hugely impressive purpose that drives them. They don’t see this as a minor optional extra. Explaining what the work is for, and generating a sense of its dignity, is a crucial task &#8211; which they take extremely seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churches and armies don’t have a natural monopoly on the optimistic idea that people will be driven by other things than money. They are just a couple of organisations that have been particularly ambitious around this insight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many corporations in fact serve the public good in important (if less overtly dramatic) ways: they keep a father with a head cold functioning well enough to pick up the children from school; they supply bathwater or provide moments of respite in a busy day in the shape of small savoury snacks. Helping people &#8211; in small but real ways &#8211; can be deeply motivating, if only we have this purpose and our part in it clearly before our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arts are our best mechanism for transmitting ideas of purpose and ambition. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bigliberty.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9034" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bigliberty.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="bigliberty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Six: How to care about staff psychology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem hard-nosed, efficient and ‘grown up’ to give little attention to what’s going on inside the minds of employees. They are there to do a job. There’s been a tendency in business to give prestige to an attitude of indifference to emotional complications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that there’s a big conviction that staff psychology is actually irrelevant to corporate success. Clearly there are ways in which an employee’s psychological hang-ups or difficulties can compromise a project: someone who is too much of a people pleaser will hold back on raising a difficult issue and thus be dangerously slow to let others know about a brewing problem; problems around rivalry mean good ideas will get rejected because of who came up with them&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real though these issues are, dealing with them has low prestige. They might, in fact be the gateway to greater profitability than cutting a new deal, but the dealmaker will get the limelight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arts provide an alternative view, in which taking people’s inner lives very seriously is the mark of being successful.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve been seeing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">via the arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a set of reasons to be less pessimistic about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">business</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An incidental skill of the arts has been to correct the pessimistic account of how money can be made. Specifically the arts do this by identifying a range of skills and ideas around inner life, communication, how to change people’s minds and what you can be ambitious about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we meet these things in the arts, it’s a ready assumption to think that they naturally belong in the arts. But really the arts are only a rather modest outlet for big capacities that exist far more widely. It’s more important that these abilities get used in our major industries than they are used for making things that sit in art galleries and on poetry bookshelves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern times, one of the criticisms you’ll sometimes hear people make about certain works of art is that they are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too sentimental</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8706" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tendency is to see sentimentality as an unintentionally funny and slightly embarrassing thing about the art of the past. In fact, sentimentality is alive today &#8211; and it’s evident not so much in art, as in a place where we might not at first expect it: in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll get to sentimentality in business in a minute. But first we need to think a bit about sentimentality per se: What is it? And is there anything actually wrong with something being sentimental? </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/song-of-the-angels-1881.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8705" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/song-of-the-angels-1881.jpg?resize=635%2C607" alt="song-of-the-angels-1881" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic thing that happens in</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentimental</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">art, is that the negative aspects of life or a situation are repressed; and something is instead presented as wholly nice and lovely.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/young_girl_with_lamb-large.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8708" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/young_girl_with_lamb-large.jpg?resize=635%2C639" alt="young_girl_with_lamb-large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth, for instance, is presented as a time of simple innocence; rural life is imagined as pure and always happy; having little money is suggested to lead to an easy, contented existence. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8709" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>Luke Fields </b><b><i>The Village Wedding</i></b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, a community is imagined as deeply united and content &#8211; a representative snapshot of a peaceful, prosperous and contented nation &#8211; where kindness is normal and everyone is sweet. No one is eaten up with envy or harbours complicated sexual longings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what’s the problem? What’s so bad about doing this?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem One: It leads to disappointment</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an essay, <em>D</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>e</em> Profundis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; written in prison &#8211; Oscar Wilde defines sentimentality as the desire to feed off an emotion ‘without paying for it’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8710" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image001.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>`</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says: ‘We think we can have our emotions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing emotions have to be paid for.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a handle on what he’s saying, imagine that I want you to like me, but don’t want to pay the true price of friendship. I want to feel we’re friends (which is a very nice feeling). But I don’t want to back you up when you are in difficulties, I don’t want to hear about your problems or give you tricky bits of advice: I don’t want to actually have to do the things real friends do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get a warm glow as I invite you to lunch at a non-specific date; or tell you you can count on me, knowing at the back of my mind that I never will live up to the promise… I am thereby being ‘sentimental’ around friendship.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8711" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C642" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean-Baptiste Greuze, <em>Fidelity</em></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This young woman is presented as totally devoted and loyal; she will never forget how deeply wonderful and perfect her lover is; she’ll never get tetchy about how he holds his knife and fork or how loudly he snores at night; she’ll never wonder if she’s wasted her life or think that her partner’s conversation is dull, his love-making technique inept, his financial status unsatisfactory or his views about political philosophy seriously misguided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentimentality doesn’t want to engage with what Jung calls our shadow sides: our deep tendencies to aggression, negativity, spite, envy and disappointment. These ‘shadows’ are carefully omitted. It’s an attempt to spare ourselves discomfort; but &#8211; ironically &#8211; it has a painful consequence:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentimental art feeds the tempting delusion that things could be perfect: relationships endlessly charming, countries without exploitation or violence. Unintentionally, sentimentality increases the burden of disappointment with how things actually are.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Two: Sentimentality breeds cynicism</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilde also argued:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The sentimentalist is a cynic at heart. Indeed, sentimentality is merely the bank holiday of cynicism.’ It’s initially quite a surprising idea, because surely these attitudes are poles apart.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8712" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image11.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franz Xaver Winterhalter, <em>Family of Queen Victoria</em></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this sentimental portrait, Queen Victoria’s family is presented as more polite, quiet and mutually admiring than (one feels) any group of people could actually be. The natural troubles of any family &#8211; envy, boredom, guilt, spite &#8211; are kept entirely in the background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unconvincing, airbrushed representations of family life encourage an equal and opposite reaction. Exposure to sentimentality leads many people to suppose that a wholly dark view is likely to be true. So, seeing the picture, one is tempted to think that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were probably actually quite malevolent parents, who had no real love of their children. They would, the moment the artist had left the room, become harsh and censorious and cold.</span></p>
<p>In the middle &#8211; between sentimentality and cynicism &#8211; is the mature assessment, which usually means acknowledging that things have good and bad aspects that are unfortunately deeply intertwined. Maturity involves giving up on the attractions of a clearer, simpler (but actually unfair) assessment, whether totally negative or totally positive. Maturity means realising for instance that a single person might be both kindly and generous sometimes and quite greedy at other points. Or that a nation might be really quite admirable in some ways and rather horrific in others.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sent2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8724" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sent2.png?resize=644%2C167" alt="Sent2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art of past eras helps us to see sentimentality in action. But, to be honest, our lives are not generally hugely taken up with looking at portraits of 19th century, royal families or depictions of rural life circa 1875. So, even if we think sentimentality is a bit of a worry, we are not going to panic around these kinds of exposure to its potentially harmful effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve raised the issue of sentimentality on art as a lead up to an admittedly unfamiliar &#8211; but actually more serious &#8211; issue: sentimentality in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business is at the centre of modern examples of sentimentality. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/ecobabymamadrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/JJ-Campaign-Manifesto.jpg?resize=462%2C860" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This advert is designed to encourage people to buy products like Calming Lavender Baby Shampoo and Hand-and-face take-along-packs from the Johnson and Johnson corporation. It is also, sickeningly, sentimental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It entirely exaggerates the role of love. It tells us that love is ‘the most powerful thing on the planet’ &#8211; as if it is setting out, rather deliberately, to avoid admitting that many other factors are crucial in getting things done; and that the feeling of love &#8211; though it can be very intense &#8211; is far from reliable. One does, in fact, sometimes feel utterly weary of those one loves, frustrated, disappointed (and not nearly in receipt of enough admiration and tenderness oneself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would a corporation resort to sentimentality? What is sentimentality for in advertising? It’s partly an expression of deep anxiety: the anxiety that the audience is in no position to face reality. Sentimentality is a symptom of the sheer difficulty of ambivalence. Adverts don’t trust us enough to share a more complicated view of the world with us. They are &#8211; wrongly &#8211; afraid that we might run away completely if we were let in on the secret that their products can’t make us entirely happy, that they are good enough but not perfect and that corporations never really love their customers, they’re trying at best to make them a little happier in one or two areas of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are also tempted by sentimentality in their dealings with their own employees. When companies make general statements about how they approach their employees, the shadow side is typically missing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image041.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8716" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image041.png?resize=635%2C494" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission statement doesn’t dare to tell us that teamwork is hard, or that sadly, a lot of work isn’t much fun. There’s a denial of the reality that the market inevitably creates tensions between the interests of shareholders and the interests of workers (and customers). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two causes of sentimentality in business. The first is a fear of the fragility of the audience, a worry that it won’t be able to cope with the truth. You think the truth is actually OK. But you fear that other people will get excessively agitated and upset. For businesses the shadow side is this: companies have to make a profit. Businesses have to follow demand. Employees sometimes have to be pushed quite hard or fired to raise profits. They are always means, not ends. Many decision have to be based on the bottom line. Because these facts aren’t fantastic, companies get very nervous about being honest around them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, we&#8217;re by nature drawn not to the most delightful things, not to things which suppress the complexity of existence, but those which convey it, and yet still demonstrate a basic confidence and faith.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/N03523_10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8717" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/N03523_10.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="Robin c.1912 by Augustus John OM 1878-1961" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>Augustus John,<i> Robin </i></b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augustus John’s portrait of his son is endearing because &#8211; unlike a more sentimental picture &#8211; the child feels real; he could be quite naughty and then very playful; he might maybe make a big fuss about eating broccoli and then pretend to be a lion with a very sore paw; he could be great at climbing trees but also quite mean to his younger sister. The truth is we don’t really warm to perfection; we are too quickly conscious of the lie. But this is an insight that tends to fade quickly. When imagining how to get other people to like us or be loyal to our company or interested in something we’d like to sell them, we too often feel we have to omit all the weaknesses and rough bits. But it’s not what we actually warm to ourselves if we reflect on our experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second reason for business sentimentality is darker. People sometimes get very sentimental when they feel very guilty, when something pretty bad is going on just off-stage. It’s a kind of bubble wrap around brutish things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company that’s mostly spending time desperately trying to extract every cent of profit from its customers will &#8211; in a kind of reactive excess &#8211; declare it’s love for them: </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image10.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8718" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image10.png?resize=452%2C600" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Societies or businesses with a backdrop of pretty cynical attitudes &#8211; where there’s actually a lot of very brutal employee-employer relations and a lot of disrespect for customers &#8211; are also often those where there’s a lot of overcompensatory moves. When the sugar coating has to be very thick, it’s often a sign of something pretty bitter underneath. A company which has traditionally not been very concerned about its impact on the environment might &#8211; in a sentimental boomerang move &#8211; feel very drawn to representing itself with dolphins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/emmf_dolphins1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8737" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/emmf_dolphins1.jpg?resize=340%2C482" alt="emmf_dolphins" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution to this sort of sentimentality is to relieve the pressure of a bad conscience by changing one’s ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Utopia, there would be less brutality, and therefore less cynicism and less sentimentality. We’d be able to discuss the truth &#8211; because the truth felt bearable.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It doesn’t seem to make sense to suggest that there might be such a thing as ‘good materialism’: after all, surely materialism is just plain bad? When people want to pinpoint the root cause of corruption in our age, they generally only need to point the finger at our attachment to material things. We’re apparently sick because we’re so materialistic.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages_135445029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/GettyImages_135445029.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Shop West End VIP Weekend - Sponsored by American Express" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Leo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8677" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Leo.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - Sep 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem as if we’re faced with a stark choice. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can be materialistic: obsessed with money and possessions, shallow and selfish. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can reject materialism, be good and focus on more important matters of the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most of us are, in our hearts, stuck somewhere between these two choices, which is uncomfortable. We are still enmeshed in the desire to possess &#8211; but we are encouraged to feel rather bad about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, crucially, it’s not actually materialism &#8211; the pure fact of buying things and getting excited by possessions &#8211; that’s ever really the problem. We’re failing to make a clear distinction between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of materialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s try to understand good materialism through a slightly unusual route: religion. Because we see them as focused exclusively on spiritual things, it can be surprising to note how much use religions have made of material things. They have spent a lot time making, and thinking about scrolls to hang in your house, shrines, temples, monasteries, art-works, clothes, ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn3.volusion.com/7gorz.q2kns/v/vspfiles/photos/JJ3AG233-2.jpg?resize=449%2C356" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, they have cared about these things for one reason only – because they have wanted material things to serve the highest and noblest purpose: the development of our souls. It is just that they have recognised that we are incarnate sensory bodily beings &#8211; and that the way to get through to our souls has to be, at least in part, through our bodies (rather than merely through the intellect).</p>
<h5><strong><strong>        <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/17318991686_ab45c05130_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8678" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/17318991686_ab45c05130_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="17318991686_ab45c05130_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></h5>
<h5><b>Material objects in the service of spiritual growth: Frari Church, Venice.</b></h5>
<p>The importance of material things was, for centuries, at the core of Christianity, which proposed that Jesus was both the highest spiritual being, <em>and</em> a flesh and blood person: he was the spirit incarnate; holiness em<em>bodied</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8679" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes.jpg?resize=635%2C400" alt="Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Jesus tells his followers about his theory of good materialism: transubstantiation:<strong> Vicente Masip &#8211; <i>The Last Supper</i> 1562</strong></h5>
<p>In the Catholic Mass, great significance is accorded to bread and wine, which are believed to be <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">transubstantiations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Christ; that is, material objects which simultaneously have a spiritual identity, just as Jesus himself combined the spiritual and the bodily while on earth</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6-ap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8680" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6-ap.jpg?resize=635%2C401" alt="Francis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can sound like a very weird and arcane point entirely removed from the local shopping mall &#8211; but exactly the same concept actually applies outside of religions. Many</span> good material possession can be said to involve a kind of ‘transubstantiation’, whereby they are both practical and physical and also embody or allude to a positive personality or spirit.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BN2BKBKGB.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8681" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BN2BKBKGB.jpg?resize=338%2C338" alt="BN2BKBKGB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take this watch by the designer Dieter Rams. To the outer eye, it is an ordinary time-piece, but at a psychological level, it is also a kind of transubstantiation. It tells the time, while subtly hinting at more psychological or even spiritual ideals of purity, simplicity and harmony. It tells us how long there is till lunch, while gently trying to nudge us towards being a certain sort of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or take this chair.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8682" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image00.jpg?resize=359%2C478" alt="Directoire style chair with wicker seat" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It too ‘transubstantiates’ a set of important values: straightforwardness, strength, honesty and elegance. By getting closer to the chair, we stand to become a little more like it, which is an important piece of inner evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material objects can therefore be said to play a positive psychological (or spiritual) role in our lives when higher more positive ideals are ‘materialised’ in them, and so when buying and using them daily gives us a chance to get closer to our better selves. When they are contained in physical things, valuable psychological qualities that are otherwise often intermittent in our thoughts and conduct can become more stable and resilient.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_91.1.226.jpg?resize=372%2C303" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is not to say that all consumerism just conveniently turns out to be great. It depends on what a given material object stands for. An object can transubstantiate the very worst sides of human nature &#8211; greed, callousness, the desire to triumph &#8211; as much as it can the best. So we must be careful not to decry or celebrate all material consumption: we have to ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by making, are those that lend most encouragement to our higher, better natures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most of what we call ‘politics’ really revolves around the question of what you need to do to make a country richer.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than ask this of any specific country, let’s imagine designing a country from scratch. How could you make it as rich as possible? Suppose the brief was to design ‘Richland’: an ideal wealth-creating society. What would be the chief characteristics you’d need to build into this society? What would a nation look like that was ideally suited to success in modern capitalism?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8056" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditional economics guides us to eight core requirements for Richland:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– military security &amp; law and order</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– lack of corruption in institutions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– low amounts of red-tape around employment legislation and taxation</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a technically well-educated, mobile, flexible labour-force</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– high-grade infrastructure and good telecommunications</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– fair, transparent and competitive markets</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– reliably enforceable contracts</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– low corporation tax (between 10 and 15%)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But aside from these eight, there is one other thing that invariably makes a critical difference to the wealth of societies: what we might call cultural factors. To make Richland properly rich, you’d need to ensure that a number of cultural factors were embedded in the national mentality. Here are some of these wealth-inducing attitudes:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">WORK DEFINES WHO YOU ARE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, at parties, the first thing people want to know is: what do you do? According to how you answer, people are either delighted to see you, or swiftly abandon you by the peanuts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/543642045_0464ec8832_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8057" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/543642045_0464ec8832_o.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="543642045_0464ec8832_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Seite-3</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, what is on your business card is simply who you are. All the other stuff &#8211; what you were like as a child, what you think of late at night, who your parents are &#8211; doesn’t really matter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, friendships are usually linked to work and involve covert status rivalries. If you fall behind, your friends might drop you. You have to invest an enormous amount of effort in your career, not merely to make money, but so you can have a functioning social identity: so that people will be nice to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LOVE IS EXTRINSIC, NOT INTRINSIC</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, parents place a tremendous emphasis on educational achievements. Children come away feeling not just that it’s nice to do well in exams,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but that they are more loveable human beings, more worthy of existence, if they triumph at school, especially in maths and science.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/16241388115_fec39f427a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8061" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/16241388115_fec39f427a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="16241388115_fec39f427a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Chris &amp; Karen Highland</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You therefore learn early on that love comes from successful performance: the more you achieve, the kinder people will be to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OPTIMISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, everyone is encouraged from a young age to imagine that they might one day &#8211; perhaps by 33 &#8211; be the richest person in the country &#8211; if they work hard. Posters of rich and famous people adorn the walls of primary schools. The national anthem is called ‘I can do it!’ &#8211; an ecstatic rendition of human possibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/522695099_026b8d7ffe_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8059" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/522695099_026b8d7ffe_z.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="522695099_026b8d7ffe_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Joi Ito</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This keeps the workforce highly motivated. Dreams of successful entrepreneurship abound. But by middle age, most people in Richland have by definition failed to measure up to the exalted hopes once placed in them. They keep their regrets hidden, however &#8211; and are quietly prescribed tranquilizers and antidepressants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">EVERYONE IS ANXIOUS ALL THE TIME</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People don’t sleep very well in Richland. They’re often up at 4 am. Their worries all relate to their careers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5960469024_ba617aa78c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8060" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5960469024_ba617aa78c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5960469024_ba617aa78c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Jacob Stewart</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because market capitalism in Richland is very ‘efficient’. Efficiency means constant innovation and rivalry: the weaker players in any field are always driven out of business swiftly and without mercy. The stock market is ruthless about punishing underperformance (normally on a quarterly basis). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE CONSUMER IS KING</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, everything is geared towards the needs of the consumer: there must be low prices, there has to be excellent customer service, shops have to be open at all hours. There can be no sacrosanct high holidays or weekends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2680078880_d883433f98_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8062" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2680078880_d883433f98_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2680078880_d883433f98_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Andy Wilson</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though most people are both consumers and producers, in Richland, they are taught to think of themselves primarily as consumers. In their minds, their multiple woes as producers are carefully disassociated from the scale of their expectations as consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE NEWS IS ALWAYS TERRIFYING</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is ‘news’ everywhere in Richland &#8211; on websites, phones and 24 hour channels &#8211; and it’s always catastrophic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3004665693_c32ab495a6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8063" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3004665693_c32ab495a6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3004665693_c32ab495a6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/caruba</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Citizens thereby learn that the world is incredibly unsafe and that terror, accident and cruelty await at every turn. There is utter silence about anything positive. Every encounter with the media leaves one suspecting that the only way to protect oneself is through the accumulation of ever larger sums of money. People take out a lot of insurance in Richland, a gift the news industry unwittingly hands to insurance brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SPARE TIME</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, people don’t take many holidays. Generally, they are very self-denying and scared about what might happen if they don’t remain in the office long enough. They get up early, are suspicious of any kind of indulgence and have sandwiches at their desks for lunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2581218229_53331b00b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8064" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2581218229_53331b00b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="2581218229_53331b00b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Alan Cleaver</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand they are very interested in paying a lot for what they call ‘fun’. They pay a significant premium to have a car that can go at twice the legal speed-limit and for flying far away on holiday many times a year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Activities that don’t cost much &#8211; like going for long walks round the local neighbourhood or writing poetry &#8211; are seen as unimpressive, slightly eccentric things. Though many of Richland’s psychologists speak of the benefit of parents spending time with their small children, most children are brought up by staff from low-wage countries while their parents go to work. This lack of secure attachment does wonders for the children in turn: they grow up anxious, eager to please and desperate to attain security through work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FASHION RULES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, there are powerful currents of fashion around most things: what thickness your TV screen has, what kind of ethnicity of food you eat, what models of phone you talk on. People can get rapidly dissatisfied with their current possessions and quickly excited by new products. It feels very important to be up to date. It is a serious blow to one’s self-esteem to feel that one is missing a trend. You can get into trouble if your phone is more than three years old. People speak highly of thinking for yourself, but sheep-like behaviour is far better for the shops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CELEBRITIES SPARKLE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every society has famous people in it. But Richland is very selective about its heroes: it doesn’t revere contemplative monks, wise sages or philosophers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6808408671_de92a259aa_b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8066" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6808408671_de92a259aa_b1.jpg?resize=462%2C667" alt="6808408671_de92a259aa_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Jasmine Kaloudis</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Glamour is monopolised by wealth creators, especially ones in film. Their doings are constantly reported on so that the lives of most ordinary people seem squalid and awful by comparison. News of the famous means that people try much, much harder to work and improve their apparently miserable lot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">MERITOCRACY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Richland is seen as a very ‘fair’ place. If you work hard and are clever, you’ll get there. There’s no nepotism or insider trading. The playing field is level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8072" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/UK Parliament</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s a lovely philosophy for the winners, but more punitive for those who get left behind. They are termed ‘losers’ and are judged personally responsible for their own shortcomings. It’s a culture that is very hostile to the idea of luck. You are the author of your own fate. If things go wrong, don’t blame anyone else. There’s a very high suicide rate in Richland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LITTLE RELIGION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, there’s no religion that energetically promotes spiritual goods and sees kindness and wisdom as superior to wealth and power. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In general, people are secular and mock the religious. But in so far as some people do believe, the God they believe in is remarkably materialistic: it’s a chap in the sky who believes in rewarding those who are good with dollops of money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">BAD WEATHER</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Richland has very bad weather. It combines the worst of England and the Netherlands:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>brief, mild, unreliable summers with only around seven cloudless days in it and with the temperature rarely getting into the 20s. Then come long endless dark winters with gusty, icy winds and low heavy cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/17970662609_8c682a23b1_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8067" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/17970662609_8c682a23b1_k.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="17970662609_8c682a23b1_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Picturepest</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, the natural world delivers a constant reminder that delight is never freely and bountifully provided by nature; good things don’t grow on trees, only unremitting human industry can provide salvation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The citizens of Richland can certainly be envied for their wealth: their shopping malls are extraordinary and the restaurants are truly superlative. But they also have to be a little pitied for some of their 4am anxieties; for their relentless doubts about their careers and for the worry that no one can really like them outside of what they have managed to achieve this quarter.</span></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve grown used to belittling things that don&#8217;t happen to be important to us right now with the powerful term, &#8216;first world problem&#8217;. This kind of tough-minded response is understandable but a bit counterproductive. Just because an issue isn&#8217;t connected to life or death, doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t cause genuine pain or isn&#8217;t worth thinking about. A problem can be important without being life-threatening. Moreover, we should be excited by trying to solve the most advanced problems out there.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our societies are guided by a discipline that we can still usefully refer to as Classical Economics. Classical Economics looks at the workings of supply and demand with a deliberate avoidance of evaluation. The economist today is expected to display no judgements about the worth or dignity of any activity. The aim is to make economics a respectable science like physics. When Newton analysed the laws of motion he did not distinguish whether an object in flight was an assassin’s bullet or a rose petal caught up in a warm breeze at dusk. From the point of view of mechanics, the evil of an act or the beauty of a moment are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Devoted to a cult of neutrality, classical economics has lost sight of its grander – and truer –purpose, which is to enable us to lead good lives. This is the goal to which Good Economics returns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical Economics maintains an amoral neutrality in connection with four major areas of human activity:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ONE: DEMAND</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Classical Economics considers all demand or consumption to be equal in principle and to vary only in the quantities of money involved. One society might have a huge demand for wrestling matches and spend 10 billion pounds a year attending them, but nothing on poetry. While another society spends the 10 billion on poetry, and nothing on wrestling. In Classical economic terms there’s no interesting difference. And it would considered entirely wrong for an economist to say one society was better than another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461842294.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5471" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461842294.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="NY Times Chairman And Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr Rings NYSE Closing Bell" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if next year, the wrestling society spends a record 11 billion, it is cause for praise: demand is growing, which is always good, irrespective of what it is actually demand for. The classic approach does not try to adjudicate what a person, or a society, should want to consume. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">TWO: WAGES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the classical view, wages and salaries are rightly determined by what the market will bear. The theory is neutral on the human worth or merit of any kind of activity. It does not ask to what extent wages and salaries reflect the genuine contribution a person makes to the well-being of others. It cannot lament that a primary school teacher, who is devoted to developing the confidence and curiosity of a child, is paid a tiny fraction of the remuneration received by someone who bets on currency exchanges all day. Work is regarded only with respect to its financial status. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THREE: PROFIT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Profit is, too, assessed only in terms of quantity. So long as one stays within the law, classical economics is neutral on the issue of how it is produced. To make profit from running a casino is no more or less admirable, no better or worse, than to make it by designing and constructing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>beautiful streets of small houses. The crucial factor is the rate of return on capital (assuming comparable levels of risk). The theory would advocate moving funds out of the construction of attractive streets and into gambling if the rate of return is higher and the level of risk the same.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classical view is neutral about GDP. A society as a whole is assumed to be doing well so long as GDP is growing irrespective of the kinds of activity that lead this to happen. People might be working endless hours, the beauty of the countryside might be despoiled, but all that counts is whether the financial numbers are going up; anything else is irrelevant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a depressing picture. But, collectively, we have struggled to replace it with a better one. And the reason is that we have broadly accepted the core classical assumption. Which is that we must not evaluate economic activity – whether consumption or production – in other than financial terms. We have become reluctant to mix money and morals. We have become exceedingly reluctant to ask whether an activity, or a product, or a demand, is good. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Principles of Good Economics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good Economics is the study of how demand, work, profit and wealth can be organised so as to promote individual and collective flourishing. Good Economics aims at the creation of a good society. That is, one which best serves the highest interests of humanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The term ‘good’ spooks us. Privately we tend to feel we know what we think is good, and yet we get deeply nervous when the discussion gets public. We are terrified that our idea of ‘good’ will be unconvincing, or even offensive, to someone else. We get suspicious about who will decide what is to count as good. And we frighten ourselves with historical horror stories of brutish dictators who thought they were the ones who knew. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These anxieties can be addressed. In a democratic, market-oriented society, there are no mechanisms for <em>imposing</em> ‘the good’. So, if we want a better kind of economy – and many people do – the approach obviously has to be via persuasion and encouragement and the verdict of popular opinion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The good’ is the goal of each person’s individual development: the longing for satisfying relationships, work to be proud of, a calm and focused mind. There is huge scope for progress in helping ourselves towards these things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ONE: GOOD DEMAND</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Good Economics is interested in discerning and promoting signs of Good Demand within an economy. Good Demand means the degree of consumer choice related to the higher needs of humanity, that is, needs connected to a flourishing life. A Good Demand index or figure would give policy makers and the public a handy tool with which to measure not just what people were spending overall, but also, how much of that spend was taking place in the better parts of the economy – guided by the better parts of the human spirit. It would, for example, measure the amount of money flowing into education rather than gambling.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/153851122.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5473" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/153851122.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="PHILIPPINES-HEALTH-HANDWASHING DAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When people condemn &#8216;consumerism&#8217;, it&#8217;s not all purchases they are upset about. It&#8217;s consumption that seems to promote the worst sides of our natures: addiction, violence, status consciousness etc. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would set itself the task of measuring how much of our consumption was in line with our better selves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Far from despairing that the concept of &#8216;better selves&#8217; could never be defined, Good Economics would be rightly ambitious about our ability to make progress in drawing up a moral scale. It would be in sympathy with philosophy&#8217;s noblest mission: defining the ingredients of a good life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">TWO: GOOD WAGES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would be interested in measuring the degree to which an economy sustained &#8216;Good wages&#8217;, that is, accorded high rewards to jobs with highly beneficial social impacts. Unlike Classical Economics, it would not be timid about attempting the huge task of defining what &#8216;beneficial social impacts&#8217; might be. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A Good Wage economy would not be one where everyone earned the same. It would be one where income differentials tracked and reflected differences in social impacts: where salaries were better aligned with overall public worth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">THREE: GOOD PROFIT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Classical Economics gives all legal profit equal standing. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether a profit is generated making novelty ring tones or new renal medicines.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would institute a measure of Good Profit, identifying how much of an economy or a company&#8217;s profit was broadly in line with milestones of human progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461777874.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5475" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461777874.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="Seaside Town Of Redcar A Marginal Seat In The  2015 Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">FOUR: GOOD ECONOMIC INDICATORS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Classical Economics suggests that pure increases in economic activity – of whatever kind – are always the best guides to collective improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would get fussier about demand, wages and profit. It would always want to know not just whether there was &#8216;more&#8217;, but whether it was &#8216;better&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It would not shy away from the historic task of getting more focused about defining &#8216;better&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Economics is – at its most serious – a branch of philosophy. It shouldn&#8217;t just be the neutral study of &#8216;economic growth&#8217;. It should be the study of how growth can promote human flourishing: that, in a nutshell, is the task of the new field known as Good Economics.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/464855083.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5682" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/464855083.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="New York City Prepares For Super Bowl XLVIII" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Many people today instinctively recoil from the concept of a brand.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The word brand brings with it some disturbing associations: heartless commercialism, crushing uniformity, blandness, a dumbed-down experience&#8230; A brand can be seen as a cynical way of cashing in on what might once have been a good idea by stripping away whatever was originally quirky, authentic and brave – and churning out a standardised product. It’s the corporate antithesis of art. When anyone sells out, it’s a brand that buys their soul. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are plenty of bad brands around. So it’s understandable that blame gets attached to the underlying notion of a brand itself. It becomes tempting to suppose that, ideally, we would live in an unbranded world. In fact, the idea of a brand is a really important one. A good economy needs good brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Ngv_jacques-françois_Micaud_zuppiera_e_vassorio_porcellana_di_sèvres.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5670" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Ngv_jacques-françois_Micaud_zuppiera_e_vassorio_porcellana_di_sèvres.jpeg?resize=635%2C475" alt="640px-Ngv,_jacques-françois_Micaud,_zuppiera_e_vassorio,_porcellana_di_sèvres" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a brand was invented by philosophers and art historians – though at first they gave it a different name (which we’ll get to in a minute). In his lectures, <em>The Englishness of English Art</em> (1955), the architectural writer, Nikolaus </span>Pevsner, identified some common characteristics in a range of works of English art; he saw these in things like King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, an 18th-century soup bowl and the landscape drawings of John Piper.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John_Piper_Middle_Mill.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5671" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John_Piper_Middle_Mill.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="John_Piper_Middle_Mill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wasn’t looking for a physical common factor. Instead he was seeking something far more illuminating: a shared psychology. Pevsner characterised it as: moderation, compromise, comfortable wastefulness, a sense of fair play, a tendency to brush awkward details under the carpet and a distrust of intellectual assertion. And &#8211; he argued &#8211; this same national character is to be found as much at work as in the attitude to queuing as in the national liking for short words. Pevsner was out to identify what he called the English ‘spirit’ (or, more technically and in German, the English <em>Geist</em>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/466909705.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5686" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/466909705.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="London Underground Workers Participate In The first Of Two 48-Hour Strikes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pevsner was searching for the distinguishing common factor that holds together a range of products – in this case works of &#8216;art&#8217;. In other words, he was identifying a brand – in exactly the same way that it’s possible to define the BMW brand by finding the common factors that distinguish a certain way of making cars. It’s not so much the radiator, or a typical ratio of height to length so much as an attitude to life: confident, assertive, competitive… to start the list.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Essentially a brand is a constellation of qualities, it is a personality in the material realm. It presents a vision of life in a hugely condensed manner via physical objects and services. </span></p>
<p>What is for sale in a branded item is not really the watch or the shirt. What we really want to purchase is something more elusive yet more important: a sense of belonging, a vision of life, qualities of mind and character. It is this large meaning which the brand conveys.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bad associations around brand spring from the way that often this vision of life is a little fake, exaggerated or plain daft. Tommy Hilfiger projects a vision of existence in which group sports are central and self doubt has little glamour. That’s a pity. Consider, by contrast, how in the early part of the 20th century, Virginia Woolf and her family and friends created a brand – known today as Bloomsbury – that stressed the centrality of conversation, flowers, flowing garments and sexual experimentation – a brand where group sports and cheeriness had very little glamour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5673" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg?resize=635%2C382" alt="NPG Ax140432; Lady Ottoline Morrell; Maria Huxley (nÈe Nys); Lytton Strachey; Duncan Grant; Vanessa Bell (nÈe Stephen) by Unknown photographer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a brand doesn’t only symbolise a set of ideas. It makes these ideas reproducible and universal. Brands allow particular qualities to multiply across the world. We tend to be rather alive to the negative possibilities here. When a branded shop moves into a town, people are often unhappy – and they may have very good reasons. However, the true culprit is not the pure idea of repetition. What we tend actually to be objecting to is what is being repeated: what’s being standardised isn’t itself impressive or wonderful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/110830956.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5674" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/110830956.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="04/03/1994.

<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 16th century, the Italian architect, Andrea Palladio, worked out some basic designs for villas, churches and public buildings in the Classical style. He built the first version in the little town of Vicenza. But his ideas spread, they were branded and universalised. They were, over the centuries, taken up in France, in the UK, in Poland, Russia and especially in the US. Thomas Jefferson in particular bought into the Palladian brand – and his own house Monticello and the University of Virginia – are key examples of franchise architecture, just as much as is the design for a McDonald’s restaurant. The key issue isn’t free creativity versus the cold hand of the brand. Rather it’s between the good, wonderful inspiring brand (like Palladio) and the less impressive versions that tend to be a lot more familiar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Thomas_Jeffersons_Monticello.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5677" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Thomas_Jeffersons_Monticello.jpeg?resize=635%2C333" alt="640px-Thomas_Jefferson's_Monticello" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brands help to overcome the unreliability of individuals. The brand offers the template and the rules, so that you needn&#8217;t be a genius to bring about something of genius. Which is very good news because there are few geniuses around and we don’t want good things to have to depend on such a rare phenomenon. This idea has historically been put into practice by many great artists like Tintoretto and Rubens, who were in such demand that they could not possibly produce all the works their clients asked for. So they evolved a brand concept whereby a lot more works could be produced in exactly the same spirit – though not painted entirely, or even very much, by their own hands. They would teach assistants how to do certain parts like the sky or drapery and evolved recipes for composition. The master’s name would guarantee the quality of the object – but it would not necessarily have hovered too much over any particular canvas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A brand makes an idea more obvious to us, more memorable and more powerful in our lives. Everyone has certain brands of soap, toothpaste or household appliances burnt into their brains so deeply that they may be amongst the last things we can recall as our memories finally dissolve with age. But, brands don’t have to make trivia memorable. They can also help keep our minds on higher things. In 1775 Goethe published his first novel,<em> The Sorrows of the Young Werther</em>. It was a big hit and soon gave rise to a branded industry. There were Werther inns (the kind of establishment the character in the novel might have liked), Werther clothes (the hero was especially keen on white trousers) and Werther Eau de Cologne. These served to keep the ideas of the book – compelling reflections on the nature of love and the painful process of growing up – at the front of a lot more people’s minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1137px-Johann_Heinrich_Wilhelm_Tischbein_-_Goethe_in_the_Roman_Campagna_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5678" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1137px-Johann_Heinrich_Wilhelm_Tischbein_-_Goethe_in_the_Roman_Campagna_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C503" alt="1137px-Johann_Heinrich_Wilhelm_Tischbein_-_Goethe_in_the_Roman_Campagna_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most brands have logos. The logo is a visual cue that immediately focuses our minds on particular qualities that we can expect of the location or object that carries it. Again, logos come in for great criticism. They seem to be everywhere and to ruin the skyline.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166060151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5679" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166060151.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="Inside Burger King And Subway As McDonald's Faces Growing Challenge From Rivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it isn’t the logo that’s the problem. Once again, it’s the underlying qualities the logo is representing. For many, the Christian lamb is a deeply cheering logo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eyck-lamb-passion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5680" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eyck-lamb-passion.jpg?resize=635%2C347" alt="eyck-lamb-passion" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the aim shouldn’t be to eliminate brands. Instead, the big goal is to elevate the concept. We actually need – and hugely benefit from – good things being developed as brands. We need more good things to shift from being cottage industries to being global brands. For example, it is a great pity that the British psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott (who died in 1971), remains just one individual who gave birth to a few great books and lectures that colour the education of present-day analysts rather than, as should have happened, a brand that would outlive him, complete with centres, films, logos and a clear ideology to communicate to the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The a-moral approach to economics and business says a good brand is simply a brand that is strong and popular. It doesn’t matter very much what the content of the brand happens to be. Raw capitalism is impressed only by how many people recognise the brand and spend money accordingly. By this way of thinking, Krispy Kreme is a great brand because of its global success in getting people to eat flavoured doughnuts. But we should really be asking a different question. Which is: what makes a brand admirable in broad human terms? What makes it good in the sense of contributing to human flourishing and helping us lead the best lives we can? A good brand is one that is built round a set of genuine virtues: of qualities that properly help us flourish. We need a lot more of those brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2557766.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5681" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2557766.jpg?resize=635%2C368" alt="First Krispy Kreme Shop In Britain Opens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Put in broad terms, a brand represents the collective. It moves the focus away from questions about individuals. In a law court, for instance, it should ideally not matter terribly much which individual sits in the judge’s seat. The pursuit of justice has been to a considerable extent built into the system so that it doesn’t depend upon the chance feelings or attitudes of this or that person. The hallmark of a thriving culture is not, in fact, the dominance of the individual. It is the dominance of brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a school, ideally, it shouldn’t matter so much which person is teaching Modern History or Applied Mathematics because the brand sets a high enough standard. Brands are deeply linked to institutions. We’ve tended to see this in terms of less alluring instances: Exxon Mobil, or P&amp;G: brands which don’t really inspire most of us, and even make us suspicious and scared. But equally, the Architectural Association is a brand as is the British Institute of Psychoanalysis &#8211; although on a small scale in comparison with the great commercial enterprises. But this means the problem isn’t brands as such, but which brands we give most attention to and which brands we let have the biggest say over the lives we live.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/485625769.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5672" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/485625769.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="Celebrities At ATP Masters Series: Monte Carlo Rolex Masters - Day Seven" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brands invite the recognition that great things are not usually (actually, practically never) done by individuals acting in heroic isolation. At some point every good idea, every important insight should go through the process of becoming a brand. Because this just means that it should widen its power in the world. And it means other people can join in. The world is in great need of better brands.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Every business tries to satisfy its customers. Its products or services may be modest (cheerful socks), very practical (a petrol station with enough pumps) or rather elevated (a life-changing adventure in the Himalayas). But the underlying goal is always defined by a series of guesses as to what we, the consumers, are going to appreciate. Business is, in this sense, about understanding customers. In a functioning market society, profit should be the reward for correctly interpreting the needs and wishes of the audience ahead of the competition.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet understanding customers is rather tricky. People don’t go around carrying placards that spell out their longings. It is hard for a company to get to grips with the unarticulated – but crucial – hopes, fears and desires of the people who might buy things from them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/460836966.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5639" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/460836966.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Harrods Winter Sale" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many causes of business failure (logistics, internal communication, staff morale, succession, cash flow), but one of the most important and poignant is when businesses go bankrupt because they have failed to understand what it is their potential customers are really looking for; when the demise of the business reflects, first and foremost, a difficulty around interpreting other people&#8217;s needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So let’s consider certain key psychological insights that effective companies might usefully be alive to when imagining that elusive, crucial figure: the ‘customer’:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. A lot of what others need is psychological, not material</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can sometimes seem as if what humans need above all else are physical things: they want to move from A to B, they want warmth, sunshine, clothing, more money, houses etc. This is what the bulk of the economy is devoted to generating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the flourishing company also has a good grasp on the extent to which our physical needs exist alongside some rather more vague, yet no less real or important, psychological requirements. We have extremely strong longings for impressions of:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Calm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Ease</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Reassurance</span></p>
<p class="p1">– Distinction</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Belonging</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Security</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Sexual confidence</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Status</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Novelty</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Purpose…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Struggling companies are often unsure around these appetites. They get the physical product or service right (with enormous effort and intelligence), but then stumble at this hurdle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, a good hotel (for example) shouldn’t merely be in the business of offering a comfortable bed. It is also there to advance ideas of calm, belonging or reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An investment bank shouldn’t just promise higher returns, it needs to understand the deeper psychological wishes that surround money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And successful car companies know full well that a car isn’t just a padded square box that goes fast: effective cars are bearers of a range of promises about the psychological profiles of those who own them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2. The ability to teach</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good companies are good teachers. A good teacher has to be hugely conscious of all the obstacles to learning. They have to understand the hidden reservations, doubts and fears which get in the way of someone being receptive to what they have to offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although we never tend to think of commerce under the banner of education, a healthy company, ideally, is an expert teacher, which requires a crucial shift in perspective. One has to identify with the person one is trying to teach: someone who isn’t yet convinced in any way, who doesn’t at all yet know why something matters – something that the company itself has long been very sure about.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teaching requires a surprising act of imagination, and translation: one has to imagine (or just remember) what it felt like not to know or care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Being kind</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Customers don’t typically say out loud that they want a company to be kind. But kindness is, in fact, one of the things we are most sensitive to; and its absence is profoundly disturbing and can be utterly ruinous to modern businesses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a company smells too cynical, too much in a hurry to extract profit at the expense of its customers, workers or host planet, this can seem – at first – just good, tough business sense. Actually, it makes the relationship between the company and the customer highly fragile. As in a poor quality relationship, the customer might hang on while there doesn’t seem to be an alternative; but the engagement will be weak and resentful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4550538521.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5647" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4550538521.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Apple Unveils iPhone 6" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two big reasons why companies can end up being unkind: arrogance and anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Arrogance:</strong> is a fantasy that you don’t need the other person as much as they need you. It can come from too many years of success. You feel you can get away with whatever you like and they will just have to put up with it. It’s a natural trap for large enterprises because – in truth – they do not usually need any particular customer. Yet to fail at respecting one person is generally a warning sign that one’s in danger of failing to respect many, in other words, that one is close to catastrophe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Anxiety:</strong> in the face of challenges to its very existence, a company may fall prey to the sense that kindness is a luxury it cannot afford. It gets as tough towards the customer as it – perhaps unconsciously – feels the world has been towards it. It starts to get severe, casting aside the need to charm and seduce. It overlooks the first rule of leadership (and parenthood): not to pass on your anxieties to those you are responsible for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Being natural</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of failing companies and individuals have forgotten to ask themselves with freshness and originality: what do I actually like? What would really delight me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So their attempts to please others get stuck in conventional patterns. They follow orthodoxy. They don’t see that they are trying to push on others things that don’t necessarily appeal even to them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since at least the 18th century, writers, moralists and artists have been praising the idea of ‘being natural.’ Naturalness really means: confidence around being honest, simple and straightforward about what one really wants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_557406b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5651" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_557406b1.jpg?resize=635%2C392" alt="MAURICE SAATCHI AT HIS LONDON OFFICE HQ, BRITAIN  -  JUL 2005" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The natural person doesn’t worry about tradition: about what’s come before. They are more interested in what will be pleasant or exciting or comfortable – even when that might at first seem a bit weird. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To a friend, they might suggest a walk to look carefully at the design of lamp posts; they invite you round to stack the dishwasher or dig a trench in the garden rather than for cocktails. But they don’t do odd things for the sake of being eccentric. The natural person risks being straightforward and simple in the pursuit of genuine satisfaction. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A company might show itself to be less than natural in the stilted language of a brochure or an instruction manual. The description of a resort, a piece of real estate, or airline seat is unlike anything that a real person would ever conceivably say – or want. They fabricate praise, they go in for fake enthusiasm; they fuss and show off. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They want to satisfy customers. But they are too wrapped up in convention, and too cut off from their own native enthusiasms to spot the opportunities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                                          **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider some case studies around some of these basic failures of customer interpretation. Imagine an outdoor sports wear brand. They grew strongly for several years but now things are slowing down. They specialise in clothing for very rugged adventures. A popular advertising campaign from a couple of years ago showed a woman wading thigh deep through a swamp with a knife between her teeth and the distinctive company logo just visible on her high-tech (and very muddy) trousers. They’ve had a policy of only employing – in retail and marketing roles –people who are themselves highly enthusiastic and bold explorers of wild places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company has a vision of the good life which it wants other people to share. But it is beginning to encounter the limits of the existing market of die-hard enthusiasts. It is struggling to reach the larger number of people who are less devoted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company can be seen as having a deficit around our second point: it has a problem with <strong>teaching</strong>. It has not yet understood enough about what might be holding back a lot of other people from getting more adventurous and, as a consequence, becoming potential customers for their distinctive products: hats that are good in deserts and gloves useful on an arctic trip. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4615496811.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5655" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4615496811.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Street Style - London Collections: MEN AW14 - January 06 To January 08, 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help them along, one might put together a short film series of ‘heroic stories’. The build up is that we think we’re going to hear stories of overcoming huge physical challenges – scaling ice-walls and hiking across deserts. But actually, the heroism is about psychology; what we’re hearing are the stories of people who really didn’t think they could face the wilderness, who maybe for a big part of their lives told themselves they were indoor types; whose intimidation had all kinds of origins which they gradually learned to realise and deal with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Private visits to some of the stores might reveal service staff who were (though good humoured) unintentionally brusque and confused around customers who were inexperienced and didn’t know what they wanted or might need. The unspoken assumption amongst the retail employees was that this was a shop for the already keen and experienced adventurer. They didn’t mean to be intimidating. but they were. This is what led to the loss of a significant number of sales. Slowly, the company should learn to be a better teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider another example: an airline set up by a self-made (now) billionaire that is losing market share to hungry rivals. The customers feel that the business is somehow ‘mean’. There is an arrogance around the way seating is allocated and charges levied on bits of extra luggage. One would never mistake the rivals for friends, but this company is starting to seem like a pugnacious enemy – despite the low fares. People will not endlessly tolerate a bullying attitude. It is time for the airline to recover the importance of<strong> kindness.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or think of a luxury hotel chain that is in trouble. It’s been losing customers despite trying to make everything so nice. The hotels are certainly grand: a doorman will promptly open the car door when you arrive; the cocktail glasses will be arranged in perfect symmetry at the bar; someone will polish your shoes; there will be specially designed chandeliers in the lobby; the sheets on your bed will have been made with rigorous precision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/78877582.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5645" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/78877582.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Bargain hunters fill the lobby during th" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But these well-meaning people have neglected the importance of being natural. In fact, no one particularly enjoys heavy elaborate food on a room service menu; there’s something intimidating about too much gold. The advertising reads as if it was addressing a countess a hundred years ago. The hotel has overlooked what it means to feel really at home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, business consultancies aim at improving efficiency. They work to help companies perform more effectively from a technical or commercial point of view: they cut costs, improve corporate structure and examine tax mechanisms. Sometimes, the more psychologically-minded of them look at staff morale and team learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a big challenge too around a more basic step: making sure that the customer is being correctly understood at more than just the level of price: that products and services are ultimately aligned with the functioning of real human beings, rather than the imagined figures in their creators’ minds. More than the commercial world is sometimes prepared to recognise, good business is – to a critical extent – also about good psychology.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When it comes to earnings, there’s an emotionally appealing desire: ideally, we’d want to live in a world where money tracked the value of what people did. &#8216;Good&#8217; salaries would mean work that was rewarded in line with how much it contributed to the lives of others. The highest pay would go to those who were most helpful to society.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some signs, at the moment, that salaries are not always unjust. A brain surgeon is well rewarded but a manicurist earns only modestly. The headteacher of a large school is paid a great deal more than the person serving coffee in a sandwich shop &#8211; and it’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>also just and fair that a cheerful and efficient server will soon earn more than one who is surly and slow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4617930661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5528" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4617930661.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="'Mario Testino: In Your Face Private View' Vernissage" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But then there are signs of disaster. There’s the senior person in banking who makes a fortune developing products that are more beneficial to the bank that to its customers &#8211; as opposed to the nurse who is paid well below the national average for looking after people when they are most vulnerable and frightened. In such cases, the worth of what someone does and how much they get paid have drifted far apart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This injustice is very familiar. But why does it happen? Sober economists tell us that wages are generally determined by the law of supply and demand. And this law is rather chillingly amoral. It doesn’t ask how noble or honourable or kindly some person is: it asks simply how much the market is willing to pay. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/450096894.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5530" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/450096894.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Key Speakers At The Institute Of International Finance Spring Meeting" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law of supply and demand says one reason why some jobs are low paid is that there is a plentiful supply of people who can do it. If employers advertise posts at a low rate and plenty of good applicants turn up, they don’t need to pay more. This is what happens around nursing. The human value of the work they do is often very high, but there are people willing and able to do the job for comparatively low salaries. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The other reason for low incomes is lack of demand. A poet might be writing profound and beautiful poems but won’t make much money if only a few people feel any inclination to respond to her sensibility. And high quality milk or chickens that have led an athletic life are better than the cheaper alternatives; but unless there is strong demand, it will be extremely difficult to make money supplying them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, there are two basic reasons why some kinds of work are highly rewarded. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of supply: whatever the human value of the job, an enterprise will be lucrative if few people can do a job and someone badly wants it done. For instance, being a hitman &#8211; there are not many people who can accurately shoot to order. Or restructuring the debt of a major construction company or closing a complex multi-party deal to develop a deep-sea oil field.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4587326681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5539" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4587326681.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Breakthrough Prize Awards Ceremony Hosted By Seth MacFarlane" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">Alternatively, rewards will be great &#8211; at least at the top &#8211; if there’s lots of demand, even bad or low-grade demand, for a product or service. Casinos, expensive sports shoes and trash TV shows all generate very high incomes for those who own or run the businesses.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classical economist’s answer is a tranquil defence of the status quo. It encourages us to</span> accept how things are. We might not much like the outcomes, but we are invited to remember that they are not the result of any sinister plot. And there isn’t anything very much that can be done to change things.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Classical economics says it’s no one’s fault if people doing good things are not paid much. It’s what inevitably happens if there is too much labour supply (as with nurses) or when there is low demand for the product (which is why few poets make a fortune). And it is simply logical that people doing things you might consider pretty bad get paid a lot when there is either high demand (as with the producers of trash TV) or because there is low supply of an in-demand skill (thus a few hitmen and bankers will get rich).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5543" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton.jpg?resize=737%2C574" alt="737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are, however, things that can be done to change this unjust &#8211; but entrenched &#8211; arrangement. It doesn’t focus primarily on trying to equalise salaries. It’s not fundamentally a problem that people get paid different amounts. We’re not too<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>worried about people who earn little doing bad, or if people doing good earn lots. The issue of inequality is far less pressing than the issue of unfairness or disproportion: what we really mind is the disconnection between merit and earnings (equal opportunity shouldn’t really be the main issue either, for this principle doesn’t aim at a better relationship between merit and earnings, it merely tries to make sure that people from disadvantaged backgrounds have the chance to participate in the existing essentially distorted money-making system). If manufacturing ugly memorabilia routinely leads to poverty, that would be fine. And people who earn lots doing a great deal of good deserve their riches. What we aim at here is a Good Salary: a salary that is aligned with the contribution someone makes to the good of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The path to a Good Salary is Education, for ultimately, Education is the word we give to the attempt to train and guide Demand. It is also what restricts or releases Supply.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158532882.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5532" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158532882.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="England Manager Roy Hodgson Visits Great Ormond Street Hospital" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nurses, typically, provide a very valuable combination of good will, a high capacity for empathy and an appetite for hard work. But when supply is high, even of something good, there is a danger of a lack of appreciation. It’s like with water in a rainy country: it’s key, but its value is overlooked. In principle we greatly admire what nurses do, only we stop noticing in practice. The task is to turn latent appreciation into active appreciation (so that there is an impetus for a salary rise).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is an aesthetic-political act. In a comic play by Aristophanes, the women of ancient Greece withdraw their sexual services to their husbands, who had come to take them for granted. When the supply is stopped for a little while, the men take notice. Strategic withdrawal to increase appreciation is what, ideally, unions and strikes are for. The key thing is to remind people that they really do value this service very much, and should, therefore, be willing to pay more for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lysistrata1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5549" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lysistrata1.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Lysistrata" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">A strike is only one move though in a broader attempt to make a case for the merit of an activity or thing. Remember that our notion of merit is extremely flexible and prone to revision.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are  many moments when we would, as individuals, be willing to pay more for the work someone does for us &#8211; if the case were eloquently made. </span>Collectively we would pay more if the contribution that certain people make were more active in our minds. That is the task of political agitation &#8211; and of art.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what can we do for those &#8211; like poets &#8211; who are doing good things but are not paid much because there is low demand for what they have to offer &#8211; or for nurses who we know do good things but whose causes we forget when supply is too high.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50516672.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5551" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50516672.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="Edith Sitwell;Gore Vidal;W. H. Auden" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The route will always be via Education. If the product is genuinely valuable, it must actually have a lot to offer people but &#8211; for various reasons &#8211; they don’t see it at the moment.  There’s a latent need that could be unlocked. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to unlock demand, the product might need to be tweaked. At present, the poet is devoted to a specific, technical form of writing. But that might not be the most effective way of communicating what is uniquely valuable in their thinking. The task is to define more accurately the good that is on offer in something like poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, Education teaches us a truer account of what we need. Better Education shifts Demand in good directions. So the key move would not be to have &#8211; for instance &#8211; more poetry taught in schools by government decree. But, rather, to develop education that is more focused on self-knowledge, which would increase the demand for carefully-expressed insight, thus boosting the market share for poets and taking them a step closer to a just reward for their work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What can we do when people are paid more than their just salary? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">The most obvious answer is the flip-side of the one we have just given: we need to decrease demand, get people to be a little more cautious about certain media, or clothes, or foods they currently invest in.</p>
<p class="p1">At the same time, education should play a role in breaking the monopolies that are responsible for over-elevated demand in some professions and sectors of the economy. The reasons why lawyers and property developers earn so much is not that their services are so highly valued, but because they sit at the head of tightly controlled cartels. They are exploiting Demand by restricting Supply. Not enough people know how to get into their ranks. It&#8217;s &#8211; broadly speaking &#8211; an Education and access problem.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Education &#8211; at the moment &#8211; typically teaches us to be workers, rather than capitalists. We know how to work for others, but initiating a profitable venture or taking the lead in enterprise feels to many people mysterious and closed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason that there are outsized profits in some industries is that these are operating as cartels and quasi-monopolies. Education and anti-trust laws have a role to play.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves however, won’t bring about a quick change. For a long time value and money won’t track each other anything like as well as they should. We’re going to have to live with rewards that are higher or lower than the ideal Good Salary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459270094.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5557" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459270094.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="2014 Champions Of The Earth Award" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To stay sane, in the meanwhile, we have to embrace a tricky (but emotionally calming) move. We have to fully accept that for the time being money is not a good indicator of worth. To some people this sounds so obvious it’s shocking even to have to say it. But &#8211; collectively &#8211; we are very far from giving it whole-hearted assent. In fact, we do tend to see money as the primary marker of success. A few enclaves aside, the poet who sells little is not granted anything like the esteem that is given to the producer of a mass &#8211; but vulgar &#8211; television show. In theory we believe that the primary school teacher is making a more valuable contribution to society than the Victoria’s Secret-girlfriend of a premier league football player. But our society in general gives much more admiration and respect to the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The problem isn’t simply that money has come adrift from value. It’s that we frequently act as if money did indeed tell us the crucial thing about a person. This attitude has been taken up by the mainstream Left. They often speak as if the fundamental thing that’s wrong with society is financial distribution. They want profits to be shared more widely, with the average income getting higher and the highest incomes being severely curtailed. While this can sound laudable, it actually endorses a deeper misconception. It says: what matters is how much money a person has, and tries to reduce income differences out of a sense of fairness. In other words, it accepts the proposition that salary is the central mark of the good life and therefore wants to raise salaries for the many.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/72352284.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5560" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/72352284.jpg?resize=635%2C614" alt="Man looking at paycheck" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deeper contention, however, is that salary isn’t a reasonable test of value. This has been taken much more seriously by Christianity, which at its best moments simply admits that, given the state of the world, money has little relevance to assessing the worth, or worthlessness, of a life. Its thought-experiment of being judged after death by a merciful and omniscient God, is never imagined in terms of asking how much money a person made. The judgement is projected as being about such things as how loving an individual has been, how sorry for their failings, how tender to the weak and lonely, whether they forgave those who wronged them. Whether they were in the top or bottom ten percent of income distribution in their country doesn’t come into it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In line with this, Christianity &#8211; at its best &#8211; has strongly advocated other markers of value: humility, generosity (relative to how much or little one has), piety. Its saints, who function as moral celebrities, were often poor. A great many of its clergy have taken vows of poverty. Its foundational figure, Jesus, comes across as simply not being very impressed by people who have money; while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>feeling compassion for them, as people especially exposed to spiritual danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5562" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Without remotely taking up the whole Christian world view, one can be impressed and inspired by this concerted effort to develop a scheme of values which gives only a small role to a person’s economic status.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The earnings-worth indicator</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The earnings-worth alignment is one of the most important indicators of how well (or badly) a society is functioning. We should have a public index that measures where we are. In the Utopia, value and salary are in harmony. It is impossible to get rich doing something essentially worthless, and everyone who contributes well is well paid. In the dystopia, money is standardly made in harmful, degrading ways and those who aim at the public good never get properly rewarded. Every society is somewhere between these, but tending on the whole more to one or the other. The Good Coefficient would put a number on where we are and let us see whether we were moving in the right direction or not. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the economy, consumer demand is hugely important. The term ‘consumer’ capitalism acknowledges that economies are largely defined by what people want; by how they use their money.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Governments carefully track how much demand there is &#8211; and panic when there isn’t enough. They sometimes move directly to stimulate consumption. For example, in December 2008, the Australian government gave a ‘present’ of $1000 or more to almost every family in the country, encouraging them to go out and spend so as to avoid recession.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fluctuations in the the total amount that people are spending each month have direct consequences for employment, consumption tax revenue and investment confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/142408235.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5488" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/142408235.jpg?resize=635%2C439" alt="General Views Of Trading At The NYSE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, the focus is very much on the <em>quantity</em> of demand: how much money is being spent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Very little attention is devoted to its <em>quality</em>. </span>It’s considered less relevant <em>what</em> people are spending on. They might be buying doughnuts or taking French conversation classes; seeing a psychotherapist or purchasing sports cars. In terms of GDP, unemployment and the stock market, it doesn’t matter in the least what they are buying, so long as the total spend is high enough (the only caveat is that it is a headache for the state if too much expenditure goes to overseas businesses.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, clearly in other ways it does matter what we spend our money on. Because the combined purchasing choices of millions of people shapes the kind of society we live in and the kinds of lives most of us end up leading.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/167421725.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5492" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/167421725.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="A Season in Kyoto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">If everyone wants gameshows on TV and fast food pizza for supper, a lot of us will end up working in those industries. Because there’s such a wide demand for watching football, the star players become wealthy public personalities and their values and attitudes get a great deal of attention. If, on the other hand, there is little demand for poetry or couples therapy or ritualised tea drinking by moonlight in straw and wood huts (it was big in 16th-century Japan), few people can end up working in these areas &#8211; and if they do, they won’t earn much.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What is Good Demand? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">This is where a major statement of value judgement comes in: there is better and worse demand. Demand for guns is &#8211; we can say with assurance &#8211; less &#8216;good&#8217; than demand for education. Demand for healthy food is better than demand for junk food. We should feel less nervous about treading into the area of values. After all, in our own lives, we know there are better and worse things to spend money on. It&#8217;s not different at a macro scale.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461514754.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5502" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461514754.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Rose's Luxury, A Restaurant With A Rather Unconventional Approach To Service" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take an expensive meal you had. The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vodka martinis, the broccoli and cheddar quiche with quinoa crust and the fashionable dessert were very good indeed. But the conversation was lacklustre, you had a row with your partner on the way, you stayed up too late and felt exhausted the next day. You spent quite a lot of money but didn’t manage to target your real needs very well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Or &#8211; more positively &#8211; maybe last year you bought a very nice bedside lamp. It felt a bit expensive at the time (though not in fact very much more than the restaurant meal). But you have found you’ve been reading more in bed, rather than watching television. You’ve been waking more refreshed. It was a great investment and has genuinely contributed to improving your life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So Good demand is defined as: a consumer choice that is in line with an accurate, fruitful understanding of one’s highest needs. It properly pays off. It contributes to a better life, in the long term. </span></p>
<p class="p1">There won&#8217;t be a single set of purchases right for everyone, but that&#8217;s not the point. The issue is merely to get the debate started and to draw attention to the fact there are better and worse purchasing decisions &#8211; and that a society needs to discuss what these might be.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How demand goes wrong </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the moment, the quality of demand is very hit and miss. There are some major reasons why we, as individuals, easily end up demanding the wrong things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a start, it’s hard for us to define our needs. We know we want to be happy. But our understanding of what would work best for us is terribly vague. So we are prone to grasping at whatever is blinking at us most intensely and attractively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50537173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5504" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50537173.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Mrs. William Beale" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">What&#8217;s more, we&#8217;re creatures of the herd: everyone else is doing something, so we naturally assume it must be working for them &#8211; even if privately it isn’t. We like to fit in. It must be time to upgrade the TV&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moreover, there is a hugely active industry encouraging us to want things, not so much because it is in our own true interests to consume, just because it serves the profit motive of certain businesses. Advertising is founded on our inability to hold on to an accurate picture of our true needs &#8211; and to be swayed by random desires instead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459791058.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5508" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459791058.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Girlfriends Guide To Divorce - Season 1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that, individually, we don’t get the happiness we seek. And collectively we end up with a profoundly dysfunctional economy. The forces of production &#8211; and therefore jobs, investment and profit &#8211; are often at odds with our best interests. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Tools for raising the quality of demand</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raising the quality of demand doesn’t imply a draconian government imposing some supposedly high-minded agenda on a reluctant public. Demand, in a market oriented democratic society, is and can only ever be voluntary. Raising it can’t be a matter of forcing anyone to do anything. What we need is the more important, more humane, task of <em>encouraging</em> ourselves to be wiser in our purchasing choices. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a couple of major ways this can be done: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Consumer education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Between roughly 1950 and 1980, the English cookery writer, Elizabeth David, undertook a heroic campaign to improve national taste. In endless books, articles and television appearances she suggested things people might like, she wittily mocked low-quality goods, she taught people to have higher expectations, and how to enjoy and feel confident around things that might at first have seemed alien or forbidding. (She had a major impact on the growth of the olive oil industry, which when she started was regarded as an irrelevant oddity.) She is an inspiring example of a phenomenon we don’t pay enough attention to: the education of the consumer. She was securely convinced that poor choices &#8211; like buying margarine or refusing to buy spinach &#8211; were not innate unmovable characteristics. In her mind they were simply what happens when you don’t get the chance to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elizabeth-David1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5512" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elizabeth-David1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="Elizabeth-David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an approach with very wide application. With the right, engaging, guides we can overhaul our ideas of what we want in areas far beyond cooking. We’ve done it to some extent around food. But travel, furniture, housing design, education, psychotherapy and relationships all stand in need of their own Elizabeth Davids. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Advertising</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advertising is a major way of changing demand. At the moment, too often, it seems to be an attempt to seduce people into making poor choices by overselling products that cannot in reality deliver on the implied promise. </span></p>
<p class="p1">But this is rarely the fault of the agencies who make the ads. They can only work with what their clients have to offer. But there’s clearly a better option. Genuinely beneficial products, that do promote our better selves, could more vigorously be brought to our attention and their merits rigorously explained. Advertising has a key role to play in helping us to want better things.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Consequences of Good Demand</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Good Demand were more normal, it would transform society. </span></p>
<p class="p1">There&#8217;d be fewer jobs that felt demeaning or degrading because more demand would be directed towards our true needs. Profit wouldn’t look sinister or suspect. It would be a sign that a company was doing the right thing and doing it rather brilliantly.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ve been too ready to accept that &#8216;what people want&#8217; is some kind of immovable force. In fact, it&#8217;s entirely subject to change. It&#8217;s simply a pity that the only people who actively seek to change what people want are corporations with large advertising budgets and often rather doubtful things to sell us. It&#8217;s time for philosophers and others to engage in the complex, ethical task of influencing public wants: the task of creating better demand.</p>
<p>It’s not a law of nature that we have the preferences we do. We are open to influence. It can be bad influence, but we are also open to being pushed in better directions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over several decades, the measurement of Gross Domestic Product has become the primary way by which we try to tell whether the economy is moving in the right direction. An increase in GDP is taken to show that things are going well, while any decrease is regarded with anxiety.</p>
<p>It’s not an unreasonable assumption. We intuitively understand that GDP gives a rough measure of a flourishing economy. The countries with the highest GDP per capita – Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Denmark, Sweden and Canada – are also pretty successful in many other ways. They are, for instance, all very close to the top of the Human Development Index, which assesses life expectancy and levels of education.</p>
<p>In line, though, with the basic neutrality of Classical Economics, GDP only measures how much financial activity there is. It does not concern itself with how good this activity is, from the point of view of human flourishing. If a nation became obsessed with buying lottery tickets or ringed its coastline with grim apartment blocks, GDP would certainly rise, but not in ways that would constitute progress towards a more flourishing society. GDP is not irrelevant to the good society. But it is a very imperfect guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461817160.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5456" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461817160.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Land Securities Group Plc Construction Sites Ahead of Sales Figures" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6> © Getty</h6>
<p>The ultimate goal of work and money – trade, buying and selling, manufacture, enterprise, corporate activity, financial investment: the whole array of activity which is currently designated Capitalism &#8211; should be human flourishing. That is, an economy geared to flourishing and meeting our highest private and public needs. Good Economics – developed by The School of Life – is the study of the quality of commercial activity, not just the quantity. It aims to track how well (or badly) our actual economy is serving its ultimate purpose. To what extent is it aligned to its true goal? In what ways are we making progress?</p>
<p>It’s not so much that we need to measure overall levels of happiness (though that’s not a bad idea at all). We need some more morally focused economic dials. There are many determinants of happiness which are not closely tied to the economy, like whether we make good decisions about relationships, how forgiving we are, whether we appreciate nature, how we cope with our mortality. There are many areas of wisdom that contribute to the well-lived life and to collective happiness and they all need attention. But we should here consider the economy in a more closely focused way and ask to what extent it is in itself addressing its purpose as an agent of human flourishing.</p>
<p>We’re not suggesting that societies should stop keeping track of their overall level of economic activity. Instead, we want to add some extra dials to the dashboard that tell us more about the quality of that economic activity.</p>
<p>Good economics is crucially concerned with six things that we should be measuring with all the careful attention presently given to GDP. We should be keeping a close watch on:</p>
<p><strong>One: Motivation levels </strong></p>
<p>Typically, motivation is seen as linked to levels of pay. Pay more – the theory goes – and you get great devotion from your employees. But this isn’t quite right. The highest levels of motive –which can be truly extraordinary – arise when people understand that they are serving a genuinely good purpose. Their own role may be modest, but they bring their best efforts to the job because they are proud to be doing it – because of what it is they do, rather than simply because of how much they get paid.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459986434.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5457" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459986434.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="CEO Of Afghanistan Dr Abdullah Abdullah Visits Sandhurst Military Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>We can identify certain organisations or enterprises that have harnessed very high levels of motivation: the Armed Forces in the UK, the Swiss Federal Railways (neither of which offers particularly attractive financial rewards). So, we know it can be done. What we want from statistics is to find out how unusual such levels of motivation are. Are they becoming more or less widespread? Are five percent of employees at this high level – or ten percent? The goal, in the end, is that it should be normal to love your work.</p>
<p>The motivation index shows the percentage of people who feel a high level of devotion to their job for other than purely financial considerations. The higher the figure, the better the economy is, in the large and deep sense, doing.</p>
<p><strong>Two: Misemployment levels </strong></p>
<p>We are all too familiar with the idea of unemployment. And we may be very glad just to have a job at all. The employment rate measures how many people have a job – but it is silent on the character of the job. Ideally, work harnesses people’s best energies and talents, which are precious resources, and directs them productively towards some admirable and socially beneficial result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9190" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p>Misemployment data shows how many people are in work but do not have a ‘good’ job. Not in the classical sense of a job that pays a comparatively high wage. But in a more basic sense of whether their job really is one that a civilised society should be glad anyone is doing. A good job can be modest. But it must be valuable to others. Clearing rubbish from the streets is not prestigious, but it is not misemployment. On the other hand the financial planning sector is firmly white collar but (at least in countries like Australia and the USA where the industry is poorly regulated) the work is frequently not in the best interests of the client and – from a public point of view – essentially worthless. People are employed and are paid, sometimes rather well. But they are often misemployed. The selling of credit cards by retail banks misemploys many people, whose days are spent working out how to get more people to take up credit simply because it benefits the bank if they do.</p>
<p>We want to know what portion of the working population is engaged in activities that are well-directed towards our collective flourishing.</p>
<p><strong>Three: Earnings-Worth Ratio </strong></p>
<p>Traditionally economists have paid attention to who gets paid what and have analysed this as broadly reflecting the state of supply and demand in the job market. But there is a natural longing that earnings should be connected to a person’s level of contribution to the good of others. Sometimes this ideal seems to be realised. The cancer specialist gets paid a lot more than someone stacking the shelves at a supermarket. But it is dispiriting and frustrating to see (as we too often do) people providing a very worthy service – teaching young children, nursing the dying – for a small reward while others do things that are far from inherently admirable or beneficial, like producing trashy television shows or identifying tax loopholes, but for which the rewards are very high indeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456142684.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5459" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456142684.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Teacher Surprised With $10,000 As A Knowledge Universe Early Childhood Educator Award Winner" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>So we can assess to what extent, for any particular kind of work, whether the rewards are roughly in line with – or far above or far below – the worth of the activity. What we want to know is what proportion of jobs are rightly rewarded. In the ideal economy it would be the universal norm. This figure would also tell us something important about the distribution of relative wealth. Societies tend not to resent income inequality when they believe that higher incomes are generated by the greatest contribution to the good of others. What we deeply resent is when some individuals make fortunes from activities that bring no tangible rewards to others and may even be opposed to our best interests.</p>
<p><strong>Four: Right Demand</strong></p>
<p>As consumers we are continually making decisions, large or small, about what to buy. Classically, economists have been interested in the overall amount we spend. But it is important that we assess how wisely we are spending our money. The question should not simply be how much demand there is but how much of this demand is good, or right. Right demand is wise consumption. We always hope that what we buy will enhance our lives. But frequently we don’t grasp our own best interests, or understand our higher needs clearly, enough. So the choices we make don’t actually help us flourish.</p>
<p>Of course sometimes they do. And we want to know to what extent. To study this we need to investigate in detail the experiences of consumers. Did buying that t-shirt or going on that holiday serve your long-term needs? Did it do so more or less than you might have thought? Was it, on reflection, a wise purchase? As with polling data on voting intentions, there’s no need to ask absolutely everyone in order to get a fairly accurate picture of how demand is playing out in the life of the nation.</p>

<p>Right demand is immensely significant for the overall character of an economy, because it is demand that in the long run guides the efforts of business and thus defines the kind of work that we end up doing.</p>
<p>Measuring right demand does not, of course, in itself create right demand. But it lets us see something about why we end up spending our working lives as we do. And it therefore gives crucial focus to our ambitions to create a better economy.</p>
<p><strong>Five: Right Profit</strong></p>
<p>Instead of just assessing profit overall, we need to get more ambitious. We should set out to distinguish and measure right profit. Profit can arise in many ways that are not particularly admirable. It can come through exploitation, through the abuse of a monopoly position, by preying on the gullible, by employing slave labour… It is not surprising, with such instances in mind, if some people end up resenting the whole idea of profit.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461820980.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461820980.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Chief Executive Officer Of SAP SE Bill McDermott Interview" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>Yet, this is not the whole story. Ideally, profit occurs because a business has found a way of delivering genuinely beneficial products or services at a fair price, where the price is above their costs. It might be a lovely hotel that wins loyal visitors with its charming, simple rooms and interesting, friendly staff. It could be a publisher that is able to guide authors to the most attractive presentation of their ideas. Or perhaps an architectural practice that has cracked the problem of delivering beauty rather than luxury. Right profit comes from being efficient in the deeply honourable task of helping people live better lives.</p>
<p>We know that at present some firms, though far from all, are making right profit. What we need to find out is the proportion. How much of the cumulative profit take of business is right profit?</p>
<p><strong>Six: Right Price</strong></p>
<p>The right or just price is determined by what it costs to produce something, or deliver a service, if everyone along the way is treated fairly and decently. We’ve become habituated to the idea that the price of anything should be squeezed as low as possible and we typically take our custom to whichever supplier offers the cheapest deal.</p>
<p>But overall this attitude serves us badly. Partly, that’s because we become the collective cause of so much suffering and anxiety. But in addition because we are not only consumers. We are almost all just as much a part of the productive side of the economy. Right price means that we, in turn, will be treated well in our own work.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714538.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714538.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Greeks Prepare For Possible Eurozone Departure After Next Week's General Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>We can already see deliberate efforts to set a just or fair price, like organic duck eggs or fair-trade tea. What we want to measure is how widespread the practice of setting a just price is. So the index tells us what proportion of sales meet this standard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Putting a figure on all these factors would certainly be a demanding task; though modern societies have a very good track record in addressing technical problems of measurement. The resulting information would not just be of specialist interest. It would give us tools with which to build an economy that more reliably increases satisfaction rather than merely wealth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business is a central human activity. In some form or another most of us are involved in business activities most of our lives. It’s the primary mechanism by which human energy, talent and intelligence is harnessed, put to use and rewarded. But anti-business feelings are widespread. There’s distrust of large corporations, doubts about the profit motive. We have the nagging worry that the Capitalist approach to economics might not be properly serving our best collective interests. And yet a world without business seems scarcely realistic.</p>
<p>As with many of our biggest challenges – cities, government, the economy, families – we can’t (and don’t really want to) abolish the thing that’s giving us trouble. We want to improve it. We want finer cities, better government, less anxious families. So too with business. The goal isn’t to get rid of commerce, but to get it to serve our long-term interests better.</p>
<p>Business does not have to be bad. We should try to get business right. To do this, we have to follow twelve principles of good business.</p>
<p><strong>One: Make profit from needs, not from desires</strong></p>
<p>Business means &#8211; at base &#8211; selling someone something. From the pure point of view of commerce, it doesn’t much matter <em>what</em> you deal in: you could be selling shoelaces, crude oil, nanotechnology, handguns, the collected works of Tolstoy. What counts is how profitable the transaction is and what return it brings on invested capital. Entrepreneurs identify peoples’ desires (so long as they are not prohibited by law) and seek to service them profitably.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/186106943-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5256" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/186106943-1.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="The Real Housewives of Miami - Season 3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>It might sound fine, but this is the classic defence for selling bullshit. There are plenty of people who desire the low end of the press, crass television, substandard food, bloated, ugly McMansions, two-million-euro watches and cars that look like stealth fighters. So, inevitably, businesses will evolve to profit from their wishes. Capitalism has not traditionally been interested in whether these are sensible, admirable or worthy desires. Its aim is neutral: to make money from supplying whatever people happen to be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>Philosophy, by contrast, has long recognised a crucial distinction between desires and needs:</p>
<p><em>A desire is whatever you feel you want at the moment.</em></p>
<p><em>A need is for something that serves your long-term well being.</em></p>
<p>And it’s our needs that are required for a satisfying, fulfilled life (which Plato, Aristotle and others call a life marked by <em>eudaimonia</em>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, desires and felt wants are not reliable guides to a good life. We know this painfully well in small matters. You desire more chocolate biscuits; you want everyone to fit in with you; you feel like lying in bed all day. Desires hog all the attention and it’s very easy for us to lose sight of our true needs. This is no one’s fault. It’s a natural cognitive flaw: the outcome of evolution. In the state of nature, desires don’t split off from needs. The human desire for sweet things served us exceedingly well for almost all of our history: it led us to like bananas and coconuts and apples – things that are very good for us. It’s only in artificial environments that desires can become a problem. The moment sugar refining was invented, the desire for sweet things became a mortal danger. In advanced technological civilisation, our desires can work directly against our needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/79655677.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5261" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/79655677.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="War and Conflict, Post World War Two, Great Britain, pic: April 1949, Three London children enjoy the thrill of purchasing lollipops as the Hackney sweetshop well stocked with sweets as rationing becomes a thing of the past" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>The problem is, we’re more aware of our desires than our needs. Desires are obvious. Needs might not be.</p>
<p>Capitalism goes wrong when it exploits this cognitive flaw: large numbers of businesses sell us stuff that we desire but which (in all honesty) we don’t need. On longer, calmer reflection we’d realise those things don’t actually help us to live well.</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s easier to generate profits from desires than from needs. You can make much more money selling bad ice cream than by marketing Plato’s dialogues.</p>
<p>In a utopia, good businesses should be defined not simply by whether they are profitable or not; but by what they make their profit from. Only businesses that satisfy true needs are moral.</p>
<p><strong>Two: Successful capitalism requires education not instinct</strong></p>
<p>Business is guided, in the long run, by demand. And Capitalism tends to assume that we intuitively know pretty much what things we should have in our lives: where to go on holiday, what clothes to wear, what to eat. We might need some emotive prompting, perhaps. But our current economy is suspicious of the idea that people might need to think rationally and exhaustively about a holiday, a meal, a jumper, a car. (Not least because one might come calmly and reasonably to the conclusion that a proposed purchase will contribute little or nothing to one’s long-term benefit.) In strict capitalism, it sounds heretical to say that demand might be wrong or mistaken. How can you possibly say that someone has bought the wrong thing: how snobbish, how mean. Yet, if we look at this issue modestly &#8211; and think only about our own lives &#8211; it’s obvious that a person can purchase the wrong things when the person in question is oneself.</p>
<p>Good capitalism requires that we address two, core educational needs. Getting us to focus on what we really need, what the real challenges in our lives are. And getting us to focus on the value of particular goods in relation to our needs: that is, how do these particular purchases help with <em>eudaimonia</em>?</p>
<p>Businesses can get more meaningful when there is more education of this kind around. The better educated a society, the more likely it is that better businesses will have a dominant position.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/146582168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5258" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/146582168.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="BedZED Eco-Village" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>There’s a parallel with democracy: you can’t have a functioning democracy without an educated electorate. Equally, though we haven’t given the point due recognition, you can’t have a noble kind of capitalism without an educated consumer base.</p>
<p>So, in search of a better economy, we should direct our attention not simply to shopping centres and financial institutions, but to schools and universities and the media. The shape that an economy has ultimately reflects the educated insights of its consumers. When people say they hate consumerism, what they often mean is that they are dismayed at peoples’ preferences. The fault, then, lies not so much with consumption as with the preferences. Education transforms preferences not by making us do what someone else tells us. But by giving us the capacities and skills to understand more clearly what we genuinely do want and what sort of goods and services will best help us.</p>
<p><strong>Three: We need to be seduced by the good not sent on a guilt trip</strong></p>
<p>Those who want to improve the economy often seek to focus attention on cruelties and injustices which may lurk behind apparently innocent purchases.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/179874077.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5243" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/179874077.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Mumbai Sweat Shop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>They point out you are not just buying a shirt, you are ruining someone’s life. They remind you that the grapes that have come half-way round the world to grace your table are helping melt the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru. Some people are responsive; feeling guilty, they change what they buy.</p>
<p>But mostly we’re not like that, we have a much quicker way of dealing with guilt: we ignore it, we switch off, we get defensive and say we don’t care; we tune in to something more cheerful. So, making people feel guilty can actually entrench their behaviour.</p>
<p>We really do need to do something about the ice and the appalling work conditions. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles and the lives of distant others, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make these things not just &#8216;important&#8217;, but also beguiling.</p>
<p>Instead of moralists seeking to modify behaviour by inducing guilt, we need rival businesses seducing customers to buy more admirable products. We need to be eased away from problematic purchases by an environment in which it is more attractive to do the right thing. Good businesses reward us for the slightly higher price we will inevitably have to pay or the little inconvenience we will need to put up with. They make local, seasonal fruits feel more chic; so our pleasure in distinction, fashion and style lead us to renounce the far-flung grapes (and their air-miles) and go instead for a nearby apple.</p>
<p><strong>Four: The task of advertising is to keep our true needs in view</strong></p>
<p>Advertising can often seem like a low, slightly shameful activity. The fear is that advertising creates false wants: it promotes desires we would otherwise never have. It encourages dissatisfaction, envy and frustration. It stimulates vain and shallow attitudes.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/m22383192911.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5263" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/m22383192911.jpg?resize=635%2C587" alt="m2238319291" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if we strip it back to essentials, advertising is basically the attempt to get us to see that something could be important to us. They might not often be getting it quite right, but the underlying idea &#8211; of drawing attention to needs &#8211; is not in itself bad.</p>
<p>The advert says, in effect, you might not have realised just what a good contribution this kind of thing could make in your life. Works of literature and art are often making the same sort of move. Tolstoy’s novel <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> tries to get us to see that we need more compassion in our lives. In a crucial sense the novel is an advert for compassion.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/41v9237ovWL11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5248" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/41v9237ovWL11.jpg?resize=635%2C596" alt="41v9237ovWL1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But, unfortunately, the more noble products have often been caught up in a snobbish (and misguided) disdain for advertising. They renounce the task of telling the world why they are good, desirable and attractive – and how, in fact, they will contribute to the good life.</p>
<p>There are many things we might buy, which could to a lesser or greater extent help us live better lives. And advertising wants us to see the ‘<em>eudaimonic</em>’ potential of a particular product. Sometimes, of course, an advert might wildly overstate the case. It tried to get us to believe that a certain brand of champagne will improve our social life or that better car insurance will lead to a happier family. The problem is one of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Yet, if there are cases in which we tend to overestimate how much a product can help us, there are also many cases in which we significantly underestimate our need for some other thing. Our society has invested heavily in advertising chocolate bars but hardly at all in advertising couple therapy &#8211; even though the latter may have as much (or probably a great deal more) to contribute to our well-being.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy, for instance, remains comparatively marginal as an industry, while confectionery is massive, because we are so much more alert to our interest in sweets. In good business, advertising is a serious and noble undertaking. It is the attempt to understand and to explain the way a product or service really can assist us in our flourishing. And to get that valuable, important message across despite everything else competing for our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Five: Advertising comes first</strong></p>
<p>The people who make adverts are often extremely good at homing in on what we truly want.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4a9d5_0000.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5249" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4a9d5_0000.png?resize=635%2C356" alt="4a9d5_0000" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The team advertising VW cars decided not to concentrate on the durability of the rubber from which the tyres are moulded or the excellent quality of the wiring. They understood that deep down most people are only moderately interested in the mechanics of cars. And that often our desires are not focused so much on automobiles themselves but on the kind of life we think we might be able to lead around them.</p>
<p>VW adverts understand how great it would be to be part of a warm, funny, down-to-earth extended family. They have glimpsed the truth about our longings. And then, they have the somewhat strange task of slotting in the actual product and insinuating that the car belongs naturally in this great family.</p>
<p>Traditionally, businesses develop a product and then consider how to advertise it. The people thinking imaginatively and seriously about family life are brought in only at a late stage of the enterprise – after the people dealing with things like fuel efficiency, electronics, and anti-corrosive paint have done their work.</p>
<p>In a more evolved version of capitalism it would be the other way round: businesses would start by considering advertising – in the sense of identifying what it is, truly, that people want – and then focus on product development. They’d start with the idea of the strong, warm family and seek to develop the products that would most contribute to that. The adverts are far ahead of the product. We need to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Six: A good business combines command of fun and goodness</strong></p>
<p>Usually fun and goodness have a tricky relationship. Things which are fun are intuitively, naturally alluring, warmly engaging, captivating: cartoons, sweet drinks, alcohol, lazing about, action films. While the things that are good require a bit more effort, self-control and attention. They may be worthy, but they are dull. And this is broadly reflected in patterns of business success. It’s easier to produce things that appeal to the less-elevated sides of our character. Bigger fortunes are made selling french fries than stone-ground bread or made running gossipy, sensationalising newspapers than serious broadsheets; pubs make more money than bookshops; status driven-luxury brands are more successful than fair trade co-operatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/140310938.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5265" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/140310938.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Women ride Boris Bikes in Hyde park in L" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>Logically, it must be harder to make things which are both appealing and good. Because the enterprise needs to solve two big problems rather than just one. The moral producer has to master both <em>fun</em> and<em> goodness</em>. Lots of people have mastered fun; and a fair number of people have mastered goodness. But very few have mastered both. It’s not impossible. It’s not that goodness makes fun impossible, or that fun rules out goodness. It’s just that the target is smaller &#8211; harder to hit.</p>
<p>This integration of fun and goodness is crucial because whether we like it or not we live in a competitive world. Those who advocate goodness have tended to be hostile to the idea of competition; and so they leave the public realm in the hands of those who only care about profit.</p>
<p><strong>Seven: Know yourself</strong></p>
<p>Along with love, finding a job that’s right for you is one of the areas in life in which self-knowledge is crucial. It requires a realistic understanding of one’s needs and potential – and, especially, of one’s limitations. There is a dangerous abandonment of career choice to ‘intuition’. Each person is supposed to work out for themselves what to do with their working lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/socrates-635x691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5267" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/socrates-635x691.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="Athens, Greece - 10 Mar 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>There is continuous loss of potential. Someone who might be a fantastic maths teacher spends many years as a dissatisfied and not terribly effective lawyer. A dental technician might have been happier as a gardener. A chair designer might not have thought of entering into politics (to which, in fact, they could have contributed very well). Someone ends up as a professor of literature when their sensitivity to character and irony might have been invaluable in the higher echelons of the police service. Our career choices are troubled by lack of understanding of what our genuine strengths are (which is not a matter of how we happen to feel but of how we rate relative to others) and by lack of understanding of where those strengths can best be deployed. And we are distracted by the very imperfect distribution of status.</p>
<p>For good business to flourish, we need to give very much more attention to a fundamental question: what kind of job should each person do.</p>
<p><strong>Eight: In good business a job serves the true needs of others</strong></p>
<p>One of the primary things people want from work is a sense of contributing to the collective good. That’s not surprising. Work is just purposeful effort: and we long to feel that what we have put our energy and time into is worthwhile. Our labour should be well directed. Of course we want to be personally rewarded, but we are profoundly social creatures and we need to sense that we are valued members of a community and doing our bit. People have an incredibly strong urge for meaning. Essentially, meaning comes from improving the lives of others, either by reducing suffering or increasing noble pleasures.</p>
<p>The problem is that a lot of jobs do not provide this. A big source of workplace suffering is the fear that our jobs are meaningless. It’s our recognition that there isn’t enough connection between our daily labour and the human good. We are employed, yet it is misemployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/86045612-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5269" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/86045612-1.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="A man offers photo leaflets advertising" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Good business is directed at genuinely helping people and makes a profit on the assumption that what it offers is helpful and so people are right to pay the price. The employees of the firm don’t simply get rewarded by getting paid; they get rewarded by experiencing themselves as assisting in making genuinely good things happen for other people.</p>
<p><strong>Nine: In good business, externalities are properly identified and accounted for</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the price of a product or a service does not actually take into account the full cost of producing it, because some resources have – inadvertently – been given free to the producers. In the 19th century, for instance factories were often allowed to discharge raw effluent into streams and rivers. They didn’t have to pay to have their waste products treated and disposed of safely. Society was, in fact, subsidising their products – but without having particularly intended to do so. So too with financial institutions that are too big to fail: their costs are reduced because they don’t have to provide for themselves all the safety nets they should in truth.</p>
<p>A good business culture is one that accepts the true cost of production and supply and in which everyone involved in the supply process is treated decently. The just price reflects these costs. In a good society, the just price would be the normal price.</p>
<p>Whenever a supplier provides something below the just price, they have to be taking a shortcut somewhere. They have to be offloading some cost; they must be treating someone badly; they must be skimping on quality without admitting it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/148196175.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5271" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/148196175.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Primark Expands In Germany" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>As we get collectively nicer, we care more about the path a product took on its way to our lives. The long, expanding history of niceness extends our concerns to the well-being of others who are connected somewhere along the supply chain.</p>
<p>In a good business, the price of the product is just, that is, it reflects the cost of supplying a thing while treating everyone decently along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Ten: Do good through accumulation, not through dispersal</strong></p>
<p>The standard trajectory of philanthropy is: acquire a fortune by rigorous means and then disperse it to good causes. Plutocrats like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick or Andrew Mellon made money in so-called ‘low’ areas of the economy like coal mining, railways, abattoirs, and packing factories – areas where you squeeze costs as tightly as you can and are always looking to reduce benefits as much as possible. However, once the money is in the bank, these rich people wholeheartedly turn their attention to ‘higher’ causes – among which art (and all that it celebrates, like kindness, beauty and tenderness) looms especially large.</p>

<p>It’s not ideal to ignore the higher needs of mankind for many decades while pulling together an astonishing fortune and then, later in life, suddenly to rediscover these higher needs via an act of immense generosity towards some localised little shrine of art (an opera house or a museum). Would it not be better and truer to the values underlying many works of art, to strive throughout the course of one’s life, especially within the money-generating day-job, to make kindness, tenderness, sympathy and beauty more alive and real in the world?</p>
<p>Tantalisingly and tragically, the difference between beauty and ugliness, goodness and cruelty is in most enterprises a few percentage points of profit. Therefore, for the sake of just a tiny bit of surplus wealth, wealth that isn’t strictly even needed, human life is daily being degraded and sacrificed.</p>
<p>It would be more humane if rich business people agreed to sacrifice a little of their surplus wealth in their main area of activity and in the most vigorous period of their lives, in order to render the workplace more noble and humane – and then bothered less with dazzling displays of artistic philanthropy in their later decades?</p>
<p>What we’re asking for is enlightened investment where a lower return is sought on capital in the name of Kindness and Goodness. There would be less fancy art at the end of it, but the values within works of art would be far more widely spread across the earth. The true test is how much goodness is done in the process of accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Eleven: People should be rewarded really well and really reliably for doing good. Goodness is not its own reward</strong></p>
<p>We live in a society in which – as is often lamented – money seems to be the overriding motive; children from the age of five say that their primary ambition is to be rich. Cynically one might say that everyone is corrupt. But one might point to a more generous explanation. In the absence of a better alternative money feels, to a lot of people, like the most reliable and most genuine reward, because maybe – at the moment – it is the most reliable reward.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</p>

<p>The rich are not, therefore, working to make more money with an eye to spending it. They are making money in order to be liked. They are doing so for the sake of status, as a way of keeping score and letting the world know of their value as human beings. The rich work for love and for honour. They stay up late at the office out of vanity – because they want to be able to walk into rooms full of strangers and be swiftly recognised by those that matter – and deemed miraculous and clever for having made fortunes, whose size is carefully recorded by the media the world over.</p>
<p>Wise societies that have properly understood the psychology of the rich now have a trump card to play. As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Twelve: 80% of profit should come from the top 20% of our needs</strong></p>
<p>At present the overwhelming share of business activity is directed at meeting fairly basic needs: moving about, energy, food, shelter. That is, at present, Capitalism is mainly directed at the bottom layers of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</p>
<p>For most of history the economy of nations has almost exclusively been devoted to sheer physical survival, with only a tiny portion of human effort and resource going into higher needs. Mostly people were feeding themselves and making huts, with a very small surplus being directed to the more elaborate lives of the rich.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5251" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg_.png?resize=635%2C449" alt="MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The distinction between higher and lower needs is something we understand in relation to our own lives. For instance, we know that maintaining a long-term relationship is both hugely important and at times extremely difficult. And we know that that’s a higher need than getting a new jumper. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with jumpers – only that their role in the big scheme of our lives should be minor.</p>
<p>We understand we have higher needs – for love, self-esteem, creativity, friendship and moral growth. But we don’t usually imagine commerce being able to help us. We have got a prejudice that paying for something can’t be connected to goodness. Though, in fact, there has long been an assumed link. The person who is offended by the idea of paying to address higher needs might have booked a trip to Florence or Bilbao to visit an art gallery or paid for a concert ticket, on the assumption that the art or the music will address their higher needs.</p>
<p>The fact is, commerce has only barely scratched the list of true needs. We need to live in beautiful cities, we need to have good advice and psychological support, we need to manage our emotions, we need to sustain strong families across generations, we need to cultivate our minds, we need to live in societies in which it is normal to be wise, kind, self-possessed. These are vast, immense undertakings and we have collectively a huge way to go. The fact that these ambitions don’t look the same as constructing highways of building pipelines doesn’t at all mean they are divorced from work, business or commerce. They are goods and services which have to be created by ingenuity, organisation and effort – in short, by work. And that work has to be remunerated. Far from worrying about what we might do when there is no more work, we should be preparing ourselves for almost endless labour to reach the true goal: widespread fulfilment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is entirely understandable that many people are disillusioned with capitalism. Because business as we currently know it is not as good as it should be. Our objection is not, in fact, to business as such but to business that is bad. The response is not, therefore, to wish that business would go away but to work to improve it so that it properly satisfies us as consumers and producers.</p>
