<h5 class="p1">Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog </em>(1818)</h5>
<p class="p1">The world needs changing in all sorts of urgent ways: the great question is how to do it. The most popular and appealing answer has long been that one should try to write a book, retreat to a mountain-top, lay down one’s thoughts with passion and cogency, try hard to sell as many copies as possible and wait for change to emerge.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Immense prestige has surrounded this activity for the last 200 years at least and it can seem, from a distance, that it has been deeply successful as well. Some books have undeniably made a splash (<em>Das Capital, Thus Spake Zarathustra, Silent Spring, The God Delusion</em>…)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-18919157.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4295" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-18919157.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="Richard Dawkins in London" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, big book sales aside, the world has continued to change a lot less than it should, remaining surprisingly committed to its familiar wicked ways, despite the existence of so many wonderful, thoughtful, revolutionary and popular books.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we’re missing an insight. Books – however marvellous they may be – cannot, on their own, change very much, and the widespread belief that they can, strongly holds back progressive causes and the effectiveness of enlightened minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A book is of course an ideal place to lay down an ambition, sort out one’s thoughts and gather a constituency. But that’s about it. A book on its own cannot bring about real change because the world as it currently stands isn’t held together simply by ideas: it is made up of laws, practices, institutions, financial arrangements, businesses and governments. In other words, its muscles are made up of institutions and therefore, the only way to bring about real change is to act through competing institutions. Revolutions in consciousness cannot be made lasting and effective until legions of people start to work together in concert for a common aim and, rather than relying on the intermittent pronouncements of mountain-top prophets, begin the unglamorous and deeply boring task of wrestling with issues of law, money, long-term mass communication, advocacy and administration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the <em>Republic</em>, Plato confessed to a profound and melancholy understanding (gathered from bitter experience) of the limits of intellectuals, when he remarked that the world would never be set right until, in his words, ‘philosophers became kings, or kings philosophers’. By which he meant that thinkers should stop imagining that ideas can change reality and recognise that only institutions, ‘kingship’ in this context, have any chance of working a proper influence on the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The_Acropolis_Hill.jpg" alt="The_Acropolis_Hill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">How do you change this?</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Partly, the problem comes down to temperament. The types who have good ideas generally aren’t good with money, they get bored with details, they may have the spiky characters which mean they can’t get on with other people, they don’t like going to the office or sharing the platform. Our collective ideal of the free thinker is that of someone living beyond the confines of any system, disdainful of ‘boring things’, cut off from practical affairs and privately perhaps rather proud of being unable even to read a balance sheet. It’s a fatally romantic recipe for keeping the status quo unchanged.</span></p>

                     </div></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Shelley/Nietzsche: both wanted to change things, neither was too good with administration</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result those with an interest in changing things have typically run what are, in effect, cottage industries. They may have managed to secure a brief spike of fame for themselves, but they haven’t been able to place their achievements on a stable footing, consistently replicate their insights or bridge their weaknesses. Sole authorship cannot be a logical long-term response to solving the complexities of the most significant global issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is not, of course, devoid of institutions, just most of them are the wrong sort. The mightiest institutions are commercial corporations with unparalleled power, scores of employees, a ruthless focus on profit and a single-minded interest in the material side of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s one exception to this that change-aspiring thinkers should spend some time studying: religions. What makes religions distinctive and inspiring in this context is their genius for getting organised. Whatever one thinks of their ideas (this news outlet is deeply secular), religions are not just about ideas, unlike what atheists sometimes make the mistake of thinking (taking them on at the level of ideas is therefore doomed because they are, in fact, first and foremost institutions). Religions are enormous agglomerations of people with a relentless appetite for administration and bureaucracy. So for example, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism have all managed to stick around for a very long time because they have related larger ideas about the salvation of mankind to such ‘boring’ activities as running banks, legal teams, community centres, orchestras, youth movements, weekend retreats, radio stations, lecture halls and clothing lines.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They start them young</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Plato’s hope that philosophers might be kings, and kings philosophers, was partially realised many hundreds of years after he expressed it, when in 313 A.D., thanks to the efforts of Emperor Constantine, Jesus took up his position at the head of a gigantic state-sponsored Christian church and thereby became the first quasi-philosophical ruler to succeed in propagating his beliefs with institutional support.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2020" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/coin_of_emperor_constantine1350009158052.png" alt="coin_of_emperor_constantine1350009158052" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An intellectual making friends with power</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A similar combination of power and thought can be found in all the major religions, alliances which we can admire and learn from without subscribing to any of their ideologies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with the world today isn’t that we lack good ideas. We have great, sound, beautiful, enlightened ideas to last us a hundred generations. Enough new books! We don’t have to work stuff out. We have to make what we already know very well more effective out there. The urgent question is how to ally the very many good ideas which currently slumber in the recesses of intellectual life with proper organisational tools that actually stand a chance of giving them real impact in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1">To recap: if you want to have an impact and affect society in the long term, writing things down and giving them to other people to read in the way we do in the contemporary world is fated to be horribly ineffective &#8211; for reasons that only one group of people seem properly to grasp: the religious. From a completely secular starting point, it can be worth studying religions to learn how to alter behaviour.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Repetition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to believe that people don’t do the right thing because they don’t have the right ideas. But in truth, we already have so many nice ideas at the back of our minds; the problem is, we don’t act on them, and we don’t do so because, at key moments, we lack reminders, motivation and encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7859" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C384" alt="11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too often, social reformers have implicitly believed that if you just tell people what is right once, all will be well. However, it seems we need to be told things hundreds of times over long periods before they have any chance whatsoever of affecting how we actually behave. Religions are therefore rightly obsessed with repetition. Three or five or ten times a day, they’ll tell us more or less the same thing, because they know that what seemed really convincing at nine in the morning will have entirely gone by evening. Religions have calendars that split time up into tiny segments, each of which has some divine truth tagged to it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes we see a film that makes us want to change ourselves and the world. We leave the theatre vowing to reconsider our entire existence in light of the values shown on screen. And yet by the following evening, after a day of meetings and aggravations, our cinematic experience is well on its way towards obliteration, just like so much else which once impressed us but which we soon enough came to discard: the night sky we saw on the motorway, the line of poetry a friend told us about, the sweet feelings we had after hanging out with a child…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is arguably as much wisdom to be found in the novels of Tolstoy as in the Bible – but the big difference is you’re only meant to read Tolstoy once in your life, if that, whereas a committed Christian or Jew might go back to the Bible every day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ritual</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Wordsworth_001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4300" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Wordsworth_001.jpg?resize=635%2C483" alt="NPG 1857,William Wordsworth,by Benjamin Robert Haydon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Portrait of William Wordsworth, Benjamin Robert, 1842</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A ritual is a repeated, communal event connected up with private individual evolution and enlightenment. The secular world is deeply suspicious about, and inept with, rituals. It thinks of them as ‘fake’ and too bossy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But religions have rituals for everything. All the key moments of life are ‘ritualised’: that is, they are put onto a public footing and given an outward shape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the feeling of relief, gratitude and pleasure that it’s finally springtime. Lots of secular writers have written about this, Wordsworth for one. But the problem with Wordsworth is that – once university is past – we all forget to read him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no such danger of forgetting spring exists if you’re a committed Jew, however, because you have a ritual in its honour in your diary. This month sees the celebration of the ritual of Birkat Ilanot, which involves the faithful being asked to come out of their houses and go into the fields to say prayers from the Talmud at the foot of blossoming trees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s only one of religion’s many beautiful and useful rituals. We need rituals to foster and protect emotions to which we are sincerely inclined but which, without structure and active reminders, we will be too distracted and undisciplined to make time for.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/675px-Chartres_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4302" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/675px-Chartres_1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C573" alt="675px-Chartres_1-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Chartres Cathedral</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world has lots of interest in beautiful things: there are elegant boutiques, celebrated designers, fashionable artists, famous singers and lauded buildings… And simultaneously, there’s a high respect for important ideas and concepts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what’s lacking is any particular drive to try to unite these two elements: to unite beauty with truth, that is, to try to make the most important concepts and ideas attractive and seductive (and therefore far more effective) through the medium of art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what religions have, for their part, excelled at doing. They’ve realised that if you put down an important idea on paper in somewhat pedestrian prose, it won’t have any lasting or mass impact. They’ve therefore, over their history, engaged the most skilled artists to wrap their ideas in the coating of beauty. They have asked Bach and Mozart to put the ideas to music, they have asked Titian and Botticelli to give the ideas a visual form, they’ve asked the best fashion designers to make nice looking clothes and they’ve asked the best architects to design the most impressive and moving buildings to give the ideas heft and permanence.</span></p>
<p class="p1">This is rarely done now. In the modern world, the people who make music are not particularly in touch with the people who have ideas. Therefore many songs, even the great ones, are rather banal at the level of theme, however catchy and inspiring they are in their melodies. Similarly, fashion is seen as an exciting but rather frivolous activity disconnected from anything as grand as changing the world. Serious people rarely think that what they’re wearing may have a grave impact on how what they’re saying is received – something that would deeply surprise a Catholic bishop getting his stunning robes ready for a service. And architects are now rarely invited to put up buildings just in order to glorify and beautify an idea – as the builders of Chartres Cathedral did.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world isn’t being changed as effectively as it should be because many of us are forgetting to study the tips that can usefully be drawn from religion. We should use the history of religion to inform us about the role of repetition, ritual and beauty in the name of changing how things are.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7805" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="14451317753_8923ae663e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the average citizen of a developed nation, the World Cup generated a deeply unusual emotion. For a few weeks (depending on the fortunes of one’s team), we were allowed to feel happy, perhaps very happy, about something other than ‘me’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is weird, for the whole temper of modern life suggests that there’s only one person who truly counts: you. Your career, your appearance, your spending power, your house, your car, perhaps your kids and your partner too… – but this comprises the sum total of all you’re really meant to be invested in, and to care about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until there’s the World Cup – then suddenly you may find you care with extraordinary intensity about the fate of a group of your muscular, tattooed countrymen on a pitch far away, passing a ball between each other with awe-inspiring dexterity. The team’s progress seems to symbolise the destiny of the entire nation, with which you now identify yourself completely. When your team scores, you share a joy with millions of your compatriots, with whom you feel newly close. Your PowerPoint presentation or forthcoming sales conference cease to matter quite so much. And when you lose, it isn’t hyperbole to say you feel heartbroken, as after the collapse of a relationship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-20286897.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3754" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-20286897.jpg?resize=635%2C489" alt="Brazil WCup US Soccer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This kind of collective pride is deeply suspect among the intellectual elite, but it has enormous benefits. First and foremost, it takes the pressure off all of us. It lightens the oppressive responsibility we otherwise feel to ensure that our own lives are stellar and heroic. We don’t have to do it all ourselves. We can instead be proud to belong in a very minor way to a noble and inspiring collective enterprise. Rather than being mediocre on our own, we can find greatness in joining a mighty cause. We can find happiness in something in which we have a small stake, but that goes far beyond us. We can transcend our mean-spirited, insatiable egos.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, with all due respect to the World Cup, the collective pride it generates is undermined and complicated by a range of factors. Firstly, the pride doesn’t last long enough. Even if one’s team wins, it’s still an event that happens only every four years. Secondly, the thing we’re being asked to feel proud about is, in the end, like with all sports, not quite serious: not connected to the truly salient issues and dilemmas of mankind. When everything has been said and done, as even the most loyal football supporter should admit, it’s still just kicking a ball around. And thirdly, the Cup doesn’t give us any clues as to where we might go next with our appetite for collective pride. Once the flags have been put away and the thrills and heartbreaks recede, what are we meant to do with the powerful and beautiful longings we got to know in ourselves? Do we really just have to wait almost half a decade for another brief burst?</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2925257495_9d8593af3d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7803" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2925257495_9d8593af3d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="2925257495_9d8593af3d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The World Cup is valuable in revealing that there’s a big part of us that longs to live more collectively. Yes, we care about ourselves, our emotions, and our careers rather a lot. But this kind of narrow selfishness, so artfully fostered by modern capitalism (you create more anxiety and hence make more money by telling everyone to watch out only for themselves), is deeply exhausting, enervating and in the end unfulfilling. There will, by definition, always be far more ambitions than there are glorious destinies to go around; most dreams won’t come true. How nice it can be, then, to be able to tap into collective achievement and invest ourselves in the best sides of communal life and action.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If our longing for collective pride was taken more seriously, we’d learn to invest more money and energy in things that were owned by everyone, because we’d recognise that this would include us – and could deliver a particularly intense satisfaction unavailable when we have merely feathered our own nest. It may be fun to buy a really nice new sports car (with leather seats and a turbo engine), but there is something properly stirring about being a part owner, along with 65 million others, of the next generation of high speed (200 mph) trains, the Hitachi Javelins, that regularly pull in to London’s St Pancras Station.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To console themselves after their dramatic exit from the World Cup, this kind of school is exactly what the Swiss should now be directing their collective energies towards – for it is in every way the equal, and possibly also surpasses in terms of lasting impact, the goals that Xherdan Shaqiri scored with such elegance against Honduras.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the ideal targets for collective pride? The ancient Spartans directed their pride towards their military strength. Their neighbours, the Athenians felt proud of the beauty of the Parthenon, the quality of their playwrights and the wisdom of their philosophers. A really fine society is not one that has outgrown collective pride. It is one where people are proud of genuinely great and admirable things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a philosophical thought experiment, let’s imagine the citizens of a future utopian society being asked (when there were no large sporting events unfolding) to list some of the things that they were collectively proudest of in their society:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. The education system</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this ideal imaginary state, in many towns the state high school is the most beautiful building. The curriculum is focused on psychological development and practical skills; it compensates for, and corrects, the failures of home life. School teaching is a highly regarded profession, very well rewarded and difficult to get into. A residual private system struggles to keep up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. The elegance of the cities</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just that there are a few standout famous buildings. Citizens are proud of the diffuse, general beauty of their urban environments. In this utopia, it’s normal for a very ordinary street to look exceptionally charming: you don’t have to pay a premium. Citizens are especially proud of the fact that you don’t have to be rich to live in a beautiful neighbourhood. It’s easy to get around because the transport system is not just quick and safe – it’s pleasant. The stations are treated as public architecture. There’s a lot of censorship over public advertising and signage.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7801" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><strong>3. Low divorce rate</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s entirely straightforward to get divorced. But people tend not to – because of the collective investment in the stages leading up to marriage and because of the sophisticated support provided by the state when things get tricky. The Ministry of Human Relationships (MHR) has a powerful voice at the cabinet table. No government would ever contemplate cutting back its budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. The honours system</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public honours are taken very seriously, but what’s really notable is what they’re given for: the encouragement of maturity, the display of wisdom, the promotion of beauty and the alignment of profit with the meeting of higher needs. Getting an honour is a major focus of ambition for leading entrepreneurs, business and media figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MargaretCalvert-Pic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3761" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MargaretCalvert-Pic.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="MargaretCalvert-Pic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Celebrity culture</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a country obsessed with celebrities. Much of the media is devoted to tracking what they do, what they think, where they go on holiday, the clothes they wear, the ups and downs of their relationships. Celebrity interviews are considered the most prestigious jobs in journalism. One of the top celebrities is a part-time waiter in a cafe and is widely regarded as the most well-balanced person in the country. His attitude to shoes, travel (he loves going camping near the lakes) and relationships have been highly influential. Another public hero is the woman who designs road signs. She is deeply admired for her courageous free-style dancing and her attempts to deal with her bad temper.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. The prestige of the careers advisory service, the marriage bureau</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since finding the right things to do with your life – and finding the right person to live with – are the most consequential tasks of a lifetime, it makes sense to give them the greatest attention, guidance and support. The most promising people are recruited into these services so that the maximum level of collective intelligence can be directed at getting these parts of life to go as well as possible. Tourists often marvel at the scale and beauty of the ministry headquarters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. The therapeutic national galleries </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The public collection of art has been reorganised in the service of wisdom and maturity. Instead of arranging the galleries chronologically, the works are grouped (and interpreted) around key themes like anxiety, cheerfulness, facing death etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/146142861.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3762" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/146142861.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="PRM-0123_soaring-frigatebird.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. The cloud festival</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An annual event which takes place early in the evening on 2nd October. Everyone takes time (usually around fifteen minutes) to contemplate the sky. There’s quite a bit of build up; celebrities discuss their favourite kinds of clouds and why these mean so much to them and what they are hoping to see this year. The elderly reminisce about the spectacular 1981 cumulonimbus. Young people are earnestly instructed on appropriate behaviour and how to cultivate the correct inward attitude.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. The world’s highest per-capita consumption of elderflower cordial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not illegal, or even particularly frowned upon, to drink alcohol. But they drink so much elderflower (and other cordials) because on the whole they are very keen on keeping cheerful and focused.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. People often forget the name of the prime minister</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good government is not dependent upon which particular elected representative is in charge. Mostly, the issues which affect everyone’s life are linked to policies which are developed and applied over many years. Elections tend not to be about the personality of party leaders, but more about refining the direction in which the state is travelling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3878176e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3763" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3878176e.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="Archipelago - 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Kino International/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">11. What’s on broadcast TV</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are very popular programmes about the amateur conversationalist of the year (it was won by a tax accountant last year); the search for the nation’s best argument-calmer-down; there are mesmerising documentaries about people knitting; the regulation of TV has passed away from a telecoms operator to where it should always have been: the health department that also deals with smoking and the sugar content of biscuits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other things people might be proud of:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the richest person in the country is a psychoanalyst</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they have opened the world’s most beautiful suspension bridge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there are no three star michelin restaurants</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the commissioner of police is transgender</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the proportion of GDP spent on overseas travel is the lowest in the OECD</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there are no crossword puzzles in the largest circulation newspaper</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- on average the heads of primary schools earn more than dentists</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there is a national reputation for being tactful</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- health insurance plans cover treatment for addiction to internet pornography</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Please send us your additions to the list]</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve been so sensitive about what can go wrong around various kinds of collective pride that thoughtful, serious people tend to feel very uncomfortable with the very idea of group activities and causes. The rallies in Nuremberg evoke the constant fear that every expression of collective pride will morph into intense collective aggression and insanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason for suspicion is that moments of collective pride seem retrospective, celebrating something good that already exists, whereas in truth, when there are still so many problems around, we are more focused on aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is entirely understandable. But collective pride remains a very important factor in the construction of good societies. Pride in genuinely good things creates a powerful – and hugely welcome – sense of belonging. It assuages loneliness and provides benign motivation. In a secular, complex and specialised world, we need to feel that we are not just stray individuals dependent for our esteem on our own achievements, but also that we are members of a wider entity that we admire and for which we are prepared to work and make sacrifices – an entity which, to put it romantically, we feel ready to love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be strangely appealing to be very down about the future of humanity. When we think of the future, apocalyptic scenarios come so naturally: flooded cities, energy crises, civil wars. We’re afraid of being naive. After all, we were promised jetpacks and won’t be so easily taken in again.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8075" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532.jpg?resize=468%2C532" alt="article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>We like to tell ourselves we’re too intelligent to be excited by the future. But there’s another possible explanation. We’re oddly a bit resentful: it can be painful to imagine all the things we’re going to miss out on.</p>
<p>Imagine going back in time to 14th-century Europe and confronting people with the solutions which &#8211; a few centuries later &#8211; became readily available.</p>
<p>One might meet a woman whose six-year-old daughter has just died of scarlet fever. She’d be hysterical with grief. One would then explain that in 744 years time, there would be (on the very spot where she was standing) a chemist where &#8211; for £2.50 &#8211;  she could have got the antibiotics that would have saved her beloved child.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ptolemy_map_15th_century.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8076" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ptolemy_map_15th_century.jpg?resize=635%2C486" alt="Ptolemy_map_15th_century" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>Or imagine describing Heathrow Airport and the Boeing Dreamliner to a man who had starved, suffered seasickness and been taken prisoner on a three-year-round pilgrimage from Berkshire to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Or telling a guy with toothache about the anesthetics which he wouldn’t be able to get for another 623 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medieval_dentistry.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8077" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medieval_dentistry.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="Medieval_dentistry" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Or confronting Jamshīd al-Kāshī &#8211; a 15th-century mathematician who spent years of his life doing vastly complicated calculations to work out the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle &#8211; with the fact that his sums would one day be do-able with a small plastic box picked up next to the express checkout at the supermarket.</p>
<p>We could imagine such people coming to deeply resent news about the future. Instead of seeming inevitable, our miseries can come to appear like cruel, temporary accidents. We stand to realise that in the broad span of history, people don’t have to suffer many of the things we’re going through &#8211; we just happen to be condemned to them because we’ve been born at the wrong time.</p>
<p>A visitor from the future will no doubt pity us as much as we pity our medieval ancestors. They’ll feel so sorry that we had to have an unhappy marriage &#8211; 27 seven years of anguish, shame and frustration for both parties &#8211; which would so easily have been solved in a few minutes by having a minor adjustment made to the Ventral tegmental area of the midbrain of one of the parties.</p>
<p>They’ll feel appalled that we had to die of pancreatic cancer. Or work so hard in a more or less meaningless jobs when, at last, robots are truly doing everything and there’s a guaranteed income for everyone on the planet equivalent to what a Swiss dentist earns today.</p>
<p>We’re often negative about the future to defend ourselves against recognition of how absurd much of our suffering will seem from the position of 300 years from now. We are faced with the cruel thought that solutions to some truly horrible problems of today might be just over the horizon. But unfortunately, still too late for us.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_Museo_del_Louvre_1818-19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8078" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_Museo_del_Louvre_1818-19.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_(Museo_del_Louvre,_1818-19)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>The 19th-century French painter Gericault focused on the agonies of this kind of missing out in his monumental depiction <i>The Raft of the Medusa</i>.</p>
<p>The sailors of the shipwrecked vessel <i>Medusa</i> had drifted for two weeks. In the painting, Gericault shows us the moment when the survivors who are still clinging to the raft finally catch sight of the ship that will rescue them &#8211; the tiny sail can just be seen on the horizon. But for many the rescue was too late: they died just before the ship could reach them. A few days, or even hours, sooner and they would have been spared the most horrible agonies.</p>
<p>We too are like the survivors on the raft. The rescue ship will come &#8211; but too late. We should feel a reasonable and appropriate pity for ourselves. We deserve compassion because &#8211; even if they are comparatively comfortable &#8211; our lives are still actually very hard when considered in the light of the future. We can identify a new kind of comparative poverty that we are suffering from: when a person is poor not in relation to what others around them have now, but poor in relation to what people will have at some point in a dimly imaginable more advanced and more intelligent future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making clever machines. It’s coming along very well. There are already some phenomenally smart boxes out there, including the ATM, your mobile phone and the automatic landing system on an Airbus A380. People can do all the tasks these machines perform for us, only much more slowly and very much less reliably.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/maxresdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5828" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="maxresdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people think of how machines will help us in the future, the emphasis naturally falls on the performance of rational executive tasks: machines that will help us to calculate, plan, translate, divide, carry, move and build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But one should also envisage a rather different and far more exciting scenario, one in which computational power isn’t merely directed at the scientific and logistical dimensions of existence, but also at its emotional and psychological ones. It is time to imagine not merely AI but also, and even more significantly, what we here call A<em>E</em>I: Artificial Emotional Intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need AEI rather badly because our emotional frailties dwarf our incapacities in raw mathematics or data management: we make extremely poor decisions about how we should manage relationships. We have little idea what job to focus on and when to quit. We don’t know what to spend our money on. We get holidays wrong. We have no clue how to repair friendships or handle tricky employees; we fumble as to how to get reconciled with our parents and (some of us) how to write a good novel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_3731522c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5831" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_3731522c.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="Star Wars Day, London, Britain - 03 May 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">© Rex</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The emotional intelligence required for these things is – at the moment – in very short supply. It exists, but in isolated and mysterious pockets: a few people seem to cope but on a basis that is desperately private and concealed, the way that a wild strawberry might have seemed before the invention of farming.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, at heart, emotionally-wise decisions aren’t luck at all. They are the result of our brains, which are complicated networks of synapses in brine, resolving certain puzzles very well – and they are therefore logically also forms of intelligence that can be replicated and improved upon artificially, with the help of microchips and code. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are at a juncture in history where we can already perceive what is coming: a particular type of scarcity will start to give way to abundance. A sort of transformation that has occurred many times before in different areas of existence – agriculture, transport and energy – is about to strike the field of emotional intelligence. We’re about to make emotional intelligence as common and as cheap as electricity or pencils. We’re not used to thinking that the next big thing will be tackling the scarcity of wisdom, but this is – we feel – what’s on the cards.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span><strong>SIX AREAS WHERE </strong><em>AEI</em><strong> WILL REVOLUTIONISE THE WORLD</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Self-knowledge</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Knowing yourself is at the heart of directing efforts successfully &#8211; and communicating inner needs and perspectives to others. The idea of self-knowledge has always had high prestige but the opportunities for acquiring it have been restricted. It’s taken too long, been too chancy or (if one seeks help via a therapist) too costly. The current lead-vehicles for self-knowledge – books – are highly inefficient, are directed at a generic reader rather than you in particular and carry insights that drain quickly from our leaky minds.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_57211171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5832" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_57211171.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="Library study" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI will draw on more reliable information about what is really going on inside our brains and will tell us and those we care about who we are, what we are feeling and what we should optimally seek at any point in time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, we are often deeply ignorant about where our talents lie, what our flaws are and what are true interests might be. Our c</span>onsciousness doesn’t grasp at all well what is happening to its owner. For example: I might not realise that the true cause of my irritability is tiredness; I might think it&#8217;s simply that my partner is being excessively obtuse. But AEI  will get us the self-knowledge we need. It will map brain activity and alert us in good time as to the reality of our psychological lives. Or I might feel that the dullness and anxiety I experience most days could be solved by throwing in my job and going travelling for a year &#8211; whereas in fact, the real issue might be bound up with a need to address my relationship with a competitive older brother.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With AEI technology, the work of therapy – to help us understand ourselves – will be hugely speeded up and made more reliable and cheap. We will get much better in two areas in particular: knowing what job we should be doing. And knowing whom we should try to form a relationship with and how.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today’s dating questionnaires and career counselling tests will – from the perspective of twenty years hence – seem as barbaric and hopeless as medieval brain surgery strikes us now. We will at last be equipped with machines to which we can address not the simple puzzles of our times (‘where is the nearest pizza restaurant?’ ‘how much is $100 US in rupees’?), but also the truly important emotional questions with which we fumble: who should I marry? Is this job in line with my true talents? What should I try to be?</span></p>
<p class="p1">AEI will give us a picture of our inner selves which will prevent us making so many catastrophic errors on the basis of a fatal inability to interpret our own emotional functioning and psychological potential.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Education goes desperately wrong, because we’re not good at knowing what particular individuals are capable of, what they really need to know, when it’s best to try to teach them – and what manner of instruction will suit their temperaments best.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_461762836.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5835" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_461762836.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Financial Education in Shanghai University" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all know from our own lives that there are moments when we’ve made remarkable strides and others where progress has been slow, but our society has yet to arrive at sound generalisations. The idea of how you make ‘a good teacher’ is still shockingly mysterious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are therefore funnelled, sheep-like, into classrooms and talked at for hours in ways that serve a lot of them rather poorly. But our educational problems aren’t just around schools; throughout life – in relationships, at work, in families – we are always stumbling because of deficiencies in learning. AEI will help us to evolve towards the best versions of ourselves. We should – ideally – die with far fewer regrets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: News Media</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re agreed that high-quality, widely-disseminated information is vital to a flourishing society. That’s why certain news organisations make huge claims about how well they keep us informed – and what good citizens they help us to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_156249125.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5836" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_156249125.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Crisis Talks Continue At The BBC Following The Resignation Of Director General George Entwistle Over The Newsnight Scandal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, news media feeds our brains in highly inadequate, sporadic and often manic ways. We do need good information, in the right doses, about the right subjects, to help us lead our lives. But we’re currently far from getting it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_453494052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5837" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_453494052.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="BuzzFeed Gets $50 Million To Propel Value Past Old Media Titans" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Bloomberg/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This matters so much because the media sets the backdrop to politics: it establishes the general picture of what life is like in our society (of which we witness only a tiny portion firsthand) and defines the parameters of what politicians can change and address. Getting the right information into wide circulation, however, is exceedingly difficult, because our brains are designed to be more engaged by the wildly exceptional (an axe murderer, a celebrity wedding) rather than the important and the sober. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a future with AEI, we’ll know how to lead people to information that is genuinely fruitful for them and their nations, rather than merely click-baiting them with stories that shock, titillate and horrify, but don’t manage to change anything in the world other than the bank balances of the evil geniuses at Buzzfeed. We’ll get better media and in turn, better democratic politics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Great works of art are at present incredibly rare. We are trying hard to ‘farm’ art, but it’s not going very well. We have costly writing and art schools that start with the best intentions, charge a fortune and are the focus of intense hopes, but they turn out mediocrities by the hundreds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_478045327.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5839" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_478045327.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="&quot;Vs./Better&quot; Charity Art Exhibition Opening Reception" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">A Tolstoy, Picasso, Lennon or Louis Kahn are still agonisingly unique. AEI will stop us having to feel so grateful to them. We will, for example, be able to produce novels like those of Tolstoy on an industrial scale, but geared towards our own particular circumstances and cultural references. <em>War and Peace</em> is often appreciated for its wisdom and insight. But the author exercised his mind on understanding the world he knew best: that of wealthy Russians living in the 19th Century. As his readers, we are left alone to guess the implications for our own radically different lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With AEI to hand, we would be able to direct Tolstoy’s emotional genius on the specifics of our own lives. We would be able to summon up a Ugandan Tolstoy or an East London Tolstoy: the same level of maturity and compassion, the same verve in characterisation and storytelling, but all focused on what it’s most important for us to dwell on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task for AEI in the arts will be to replicate and diffuse a level of wisdom and talent once only lodged in a few rare minds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Shopping</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consumer society is really about choice, and in so far as it makes us happy (rather than leads us to squander our wealth and energies), it’s about wise choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_135445029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5840" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_135445029.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Shop West End VIP Weekend - Sponsored by American Express" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This opens up a huge area for AEI. Think of what we have to choose (and how badly we often do so): travel destinations, art, books, clothes, foods… At the moment, we tend to operate on a mixture of intuition, hope and habit and are routinely abused by advertisers along the way. We have massive frailties in this area: we’re heavily influenced by what others are doing (though it might not work for us);<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>impulse plays a big role (though it’s not the most reliable guide); and we leave a lot of things to chance (we go for what happens to be most readily available). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI will mean encoding consumer intelligence. Just as we might work out a sum in our heads and then check it on a calculator, so we will be able to check our decisions on an AEI device. We can imagine already what would happen with an ideal travel agent, book store attendant, art tour guide or personal shopper. AEI will make these figures into daily realities, revealing how we can be persuaded, moved and motivated to acquire goods and services in line with our true needs. Money will, at last, make us as happy as it can.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Relationships</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s extremely hard to be wise around relationships and the consequences of our unwisdom are devastating. We have great difficulties when it comes to communication, we suffer from impatience at not getting what we want, we are defensive in discussions and have troubles talking calmly through hopes and failings around fidelity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI means we will be able to tap into the lessons that others have, often very painfully, learnt. Each couple will not be faced with having to confront every hurdle anew late at night in the bedroom. If you could at critical moments (in your head) dial up your most patient, experienced, sensible and generous friend and get them to talk you through an issue, feeding you helpful moves – a huge quantity of distress might be avoided. Relationship AEI will take the wisdom out of the ideal friend’s head and gives us all access to it when we most need it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_56614046.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5841" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_56614046.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="Couples gaze into each other's eyes by c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Stan Honda/AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*** </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, there are some big anxieties around AI: what if machines take over that are really versions of very cunning, powerful people? This way of thinking is based – rightly – on our sense of how rational, executive intelligence can be impressive but also horribly brutal: Vladimir Putin is highly intelligent, Goebbels was in some ways extremely smart. Massively increasing rationality can be a frightening prospect. But the cure to these fears is to focus on what sort of intelligence AI should really emulate and enhance. Increasing <em>emotional</em> intelligence isn’t frightening, it is the key to all that we most value: empathy, creativity, kindness and generosity. We face a race to ensure that we can have adequate levels of maturity and wisdom to counterbalance the enormous increase in our technical prowess. Worries about machines ‘turning evil’ might be more accurately expressed as a fear that they will lack emotional intelligence. This doesn’t have to be the case.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today &#8211; unlike any other period in history &#8211; the major impediments (to economic progress, better politics and more flourishing lives) are all psychological. It’s mainly the flaws in our emotional capacities that ruin existence. But we’ve not yet really concentrated on addressing how to make ourselves more mature. It’s been left to the hazards of individual experience. AEI will use technology to reduce the randomness. Just as, now, everyone can spell ‘scythe’ or work out the square root of 11935, thanks to AI, we should all soon be able to connect with machines that help us correct the range of our emotional failings. The age of AEI is urgently due.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is almost universally agreed that education is hugely important. But we are not particularly sure what we want from it. Our large commitment to there being good schools ironically has not been matched by concern about what they are for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of education is to prepare students for adult life. So the role of schools should be thought through only after we have identified the challenges of adult life. If school is essentially conceived as a training, we need to explain what it is training <i>for</i>. What are the relevant difficulties and challenges that we need to be equipped to deal with?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1323" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150855855.jpg" alt="BASIS charter school opens in DC." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© The Washington Post/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two fundamental tasks education should help us with: <i>working</i> and <i>sustaining good relationships.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These goals are generally acknowledged, but in a hazy and distant way. We hear that studying literature might help the imagination or that knowing some history will make us more capable of understanding current societies. But these pieties don’t generally rise above the level of generalisations – and are not explored with thoroughness in the actual curriculum. We do not assess courses and classes as we should – according to the help they really do provide in the task of being a good adult.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we work backwards from life, it is clear that schools fail all but a tiny portion of their students. This is a generic problem, as much in evidence in posh, highly academic private schools as in more deprived, government-run ones. Trouble around work and relationships remains very widespread indeed. Human ingenuity, energy, goodwill and talent is still being lost on an industrial scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1324" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/165442320.jpg" alt="11/16/05 - TORONTO, ONTARIO -Nadia is the 7th grade teacher we're following with a monthly series th" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Toronto Star/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get more ambitious about education doesn’t necessarily mean spending more money, building more schools, employing more teachers, or making exams more difficult. Rather, it should chiefly mean focusing more clearly on the real purpose of education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, unlike today, schools would be designed by people who asked systematically about the main problems in people’s work and home lives – and then worked backwards to put adequate, thoughtful responses in place in the training years. In order to address our needs, a future national curriculum might specify that the following subjects would be studied:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Capitalism</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is at present a conspiracy of silence around the economic system we live within. We find it hard to change its bad sides (or defend its strengths) because we simply cannot understand how it works. Nothing captures this more than that we currently study maths when, in truth, we should really (from a very young age) study the one thing that maths is used for by 99% of the population: money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, there would be extensive classes on the workings of Capitalism. One would study how profit occurs, why some areas of activity are much more profitable than others and how economic opportunities arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1325" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150771522.jpg" alt="Woman working in books with Euro bank notes, Symbol: tuition fees, free learning aids, etc." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© U. Baumgarten via Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim would be to demystify the economy and to educate citizens to be realistic both about the opportunities they’ll have and the economic constraints they’ll face. Students would be taught to see that an economy is ultimately always the creation of society, not an act of God or nature. This is crucial since so much of how our lives pan out is broadly determined by the kind of economy we live in: why are there more jobs in nail bars than in therapy rooms; why do footballers make more money than brain surgeons and why do so many jobs have titles like assistant regional distribution executive, rather than carpenter or farmer? All this and more would be explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An important unit in this subject would be the study of change in society. What enables revolution (whether of a commercial, ethical or political kind) to occur? A great deal of attention would be paid to the fact that mostly our frustrations and disappointments do not directly lead to improvement. And yet – this point would be written up in large letters in every classroom – improvement truly is possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1326" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/165283240.jpg" alt="165283240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Toronto Star/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the heading of change, students would study material which, at present, is classed as history. They might look at the Chartist movement of the 1840s, the Russian Revolution or the Reformation, but from a totally practical point of view, as potential revolutionaries themselves. What lessons could one learn from each event? One would never (during one’s whole time at school) simply try to understand the past for its own sake. One would only ever investigate it as a series of case studies from which one was trying to extract useable wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Business</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this set of courses, students would learn how to deal with the world of work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They would learn what the options really are – and the relationship between early choices and subsequent destinies (the purpose would be to reduce the chances of anyone in the future waking up aged 48 in despair, wondering what they had done with their life). They would learn what a business idea really is. They would discuss productive and less productive sectors of the economy. They would understand the role of cash flow, HR, leadership, marketing and competition. They would learn how to deal with colleagues, burnout, envy, office politics, interviews and sackings. They would spend three hours a week exploring and discussing what they might do with their future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1328" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/167068189.jpg" alt="Mature students on MBA course, University of Westminster" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this would begin from the age of 8 – rather than being left as a set of arcane secrets available only to an elite who can embark on a ruinously expensive MBA aged 27.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Consumption</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the view of what you’d need to learn would be very broad. It would reject the Romantic assumption that we each hit, by instinct, upon our own understanding of what is right and good for us. Instead, the education system would work on the assumption that we can learn how to enjoy ourselves, what to admire and how to flourish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Schools would pursue these topics with an eye on students’ actions as consumers. The economy we get depends very largely on what we want to pay for (McDonald’s, Easyjet or…). So consumer education is vital, and in no way a trivial after-thought.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This course of study would explain the relationship between consumption and flourishing. The underlying idea would be that one ought always to buy the things that have been ethically produced and that help one to become a better version of oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1329" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/187085293.jpg" alt="Top Christmas Presents For 2013 Revealed" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There would be units on: what to read, what kind of clothes to buy, what films to see, what TV programmes to download, what food to eat, what furniture to invest in, where to go on holiday. In each case, students would learn to ask how a given purchase would meet their needs. Courses on consumption would often overlap with the self-knowledge lessons [see below].</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In special classes, specific items – a coat or a car, a novel or a sofa, a water jug or a Picasso poster – would be analysed in terms of their potential to fulfil us. Students would be required to analyse what kind of person would benefit from ownership of these precise items. They would have to define the need which consumption meets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose would be groundbreaking: not simply to generate infinite consumer choice, but also to bring up generations that would know how to choose wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Self-knowledge</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The self-knowledge classes would be central to the whole system of education. Students would be introduced early on to the idea that we are extremely prone to misunderstanding ourselves, that we do not automatically have a correct or insightful view of what we are up to, or are bothered about or grasp.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They would be taken through ideas (many derived from psychoanalysis) as to the roles of delusion, defensiveness, projection and denial in everyday life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1330" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107828668.jpg" alt="SLUG: dc-arts26 DATE: 01/20/2006 PHOTOGRAPHER: Sarah L. Voisin/TWP id#: 176656 Washington, DC The Fi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© The Washington Post/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There would be individual tutors on hand with whom students could work to develop a map of their characters, with particular attention paid to their neuroses and defences. After this module, students would quite easily, and with good cheer, be able to describe in what ways they were a little mad (as we all are). They would know rather a lot about how they were difficult to live with, and what sort of people it did them best to spend time around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial unit would be devoted to career self-knowledge: what job are you best suited to do? Ending up in a job that you like and feel is worthwhile is a huge – perhaps the biggest – attainment. Self-knowledge in the area of employment offers protection from the ravages of envy. We get less bothered by the fact that others have more glamorous, more highly paid careers if we see clearly why such options would not really fit our characters or temperaments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Relationships</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">School is a preparation for coping with the difficulties (and making the best of the opportunities) of adult life. And the Utopian society would be intensely aware of the social and individual cost of every unhappy relationship. So there would be huge emphasis on gradually acquiring the knowledge, attitudes and skills that help people live well together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1331" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150673324.jpg" alt="CHINA-EDUCATION-DANCE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early years, getting on with others would be a central focus of attention. After puberty, the focus would be on relationships. There would be units on kindness and forgiveness. Pupils would pass not when they know the theory but when they could demonstrate in practical tests their actual readiness to forgive when there are reasons to feel righteous and to be kind when its tempting to be vindictive. Techniques for the reduction of anxiety would receive much attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under relationships there would be classes on how to have an argument, on the successful ways of persuading and on allowing oneself to be persuaded. Students who did well would feel some of the same glory as is currently accorded to those who pass maths exams with honours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, school buildings would also be a focal point of civic pride, widely admired for their beauty and serenity. Running a school would be one of the most prestigious and well paid jobs. Only the most wise, kindly and insightful people would be employed as teachers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1332" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144850620.jpg" alt="TUKE SCHOOL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would not only be children who went to school. Adults in general would see themselves as in need of education. One would never be done with school. One would stay an active alumni, learning throughout life. In the adult section, there would be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. There would be career advice for the middle-aged. Schools would be where a community gets educated, not just a place for children. So children would feel that they were participating in the early stages of a life-long process. Some classes would have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia the phrase ‘I’ve finished school’ would sound extremely strange.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, education would be viewed in a properly holistic way. It wouldn’t just be something that took place in classrooms. Anywhere where citizens were influenced and conditioned would fall under the remit of the education department. So the department would control media, broadcasting and the arts, because newspapers, galleries, museums, theatres and television channels would be seen as essentially educational – and judged, developed and controlled so as to maximise their effectiveness in teaching the things we most need to learn. There’s little point spending millions educating the citizenry in wisdom in classrooms then allowing a tight-knit group of banal and venal television executives or newspaper proprietors to pump out material that directly undermines the preceding effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re so hung up on the challenges of running a massive education system, we’re failing to pinpoint the real source of our problems. It isn’t primarily about money, salaries, discipline… Troubles here are only a consequence of a more basic difficulty that precedes them all, namely, right now, with no one quite meaning for this to happen, but with untold consequences and costs,<i>we’ve got the wrong curriculum</i>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost every developed nation boasts of having a rather unusual institution at its centre: a state broadcaster. These state broadcasters receive taxpayer’s money on the basis that they serve the public interest in a way that commercial broadcasters never can. In exchange for our cash, they frequently broadcast shows about ancient history and documentaries about endangered species.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/previous.presstv.ir/photo/20121118/rasouli_amir20121118084018007.jpg?resize=650%2C365" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept behind such institutions sounds plausible, but in truth, there’s terrible confusion about what they should really be doing &#8211; and in the process, societies squander a lot of opportunities to increase their well-being.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.radiotimes.com/uploads/images/original/43665.jpg?resize=647%2C432" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to tackle the many appalling problems they face, modern governments have developed levers they can pull to adjust behaviours. Most obviously, they have the law. They also have the tax system, health policy, and school and university curricula. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to some of the big challenges, government levers work extremely well. But in relation to others, the results are patchy at best. There’s one crucial area where they hardly seem to work at all. A large, arguably even the largest, share of the issues undermining advanced nations are what one call ‘psychological’ at their root, that is, they have to do with our minds, with our deeper patterns of thinking and feeling. These problems include: family breakdown, domestic violence, poor parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, obesity,  depression, chronic anxiety, delinquency and loneliness. Taken together, these 10 issues cost national governments an overwhelming share of their annual national budgets.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2763/4120236025_fac3949f45_b.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="374" /></p>
<p>Currently, there is no easy way for governments to address these problems. At best, they tinker with the odd ghoulish public advertising campaign, try to add on a class about this or that onto the school curriculum, play around with the tax system, give advice to social services, trial a bit of subsidised psychotherapy, print leaflets about parenting &#8211; and hope for the best.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the results tend to be very poor, because better relationships aren’t really fostered by a change in tax law, few people read leaflets, there’s not much money for public service ad campaigns and it’s naive at best to imagine that you can address large-scale social issues by tacking on talks to 16 year olds in schools on Friday afternoons.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/bpec.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dc1.jpg?resize=654%2C436" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In order to stand any chance of addressing national psychological ills, you have to get into people’s minds on a huge scale, with charm and skill, at regular, repeated intervals. This is where the tantalising opportunity lies. Just within reach of most governments, available for no extra money, stands the most powerful lever imaginable: the state broadcaster. Broadcasting truly works, it’s the single most effective way of changing mentalities, a million times more helpful than a book, leaflet or class. Revolutionaries have always known that; it’s why they always drive the tanks to the TV station first.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000T2AkqHQ4BOA/s/600/480/Egypt-Revolution-Day-05-024.jpg?resize=600%2C400" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, state broadcasters are aware that they should be making programmes that foster ‘the public good.’ But they’re desperately vague about what the public good really constitutes. At times they seem to hit the mark, but more by accident than conscious design. The dominant conception of public good seems unhelpfully bound up with broadcasting shows about the high arts &#8211; though very few nations are in fact undermined because not enough of the population know about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Traviata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Wagner’s Ring Cycle.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-CUrqwpVpcMY/VMAbvd-_xXI/AAAAAAAAFL4/GmoI-kJd8LE/s1600/15_Tosca_eb_-750.jpg?resize=547%2C444" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments should redefine what the public good actually means. They know what it is because they have &#8211; via their statistical offices &#8211; incontrovertible evidence about what the public bad is. Their statisticians constantly tell them the figures on obesity, drug addiction and broken families. Public broadcasters should therefore be charged with a simple mission: annually orienting all their output to addressing the 10 leading social problems statistically undermining their nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This threatens to sound horribly worthy. Wall-to-wall programmes about obesity and family breakdown? Surely no one would watch! One imagines excruciatingly tedious shows by egg-head psychotherapists. But that’s precisely not what the mission would be. The challenge wouldn’t be (as now) to make the odd unpopular programme about important things; but to turn out consistently compelling work that tackles the most vital themes.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/23500000/Jo-Frost-supernanny-23526604-624-351.jpg?resize=624%2C351" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is what tax payers’ money would really be paying for: to foster the genius required to create brilliant mass entertainment, the very best comedies, dramas, game-shows and documentaries, about the most salient issues. To date, this has only been done sporadically, more by luck than design. The challenge would be to generate this material with institutional consistency.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/cf2.foodista.com/sites/default/files/styles/featured/public/field/image/jamie%20oliver_7.jpg?resize=607%2C400" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To say that programming should keep the national good in view still leaves the creative remit extremely broad. With a little thought, one can use pretty much any material &#8211; a game show, a cookery programme &#8211; to explore and find solutions for the great problematic themes of existence. At the headline level, the subject matter doesn&#8217;t need to be in any way different. What counts is the way the material is handled. The story of a married woman who has an affair, does drugs and throws herself under a train can be a lurid article in the Daily Mail &#8211; or<em> Anna Karenina</em>. It all has to do with the moral intention that&#8217;s brought to the work. The newspaper has no end in view other than to alarm and shock us; Tolstoy is out to heal us.</p>
<p>Properly done, state broadcasting could dramatically start to change the mood of the nation. What one had seen on TV would affect how parents spoke to children and children spoke to parents, how lovers behaved, how one would respond to anxiety and deal with loneliness. With enough creativity applied, public broadcasting could do more to cure the ills of nations than the police force, social services and the drugs squad combined. A huge opportunity is at hand, waiting for the necessary political will, intellectual focus and creative talent to develop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern societies are deeply invested in the idea of big, glamorous weddings. We have evolved highly-detailed collective ideas about what a proper wedding is supposed to be like, down to the specialised floral arrangements, seat covers, presents for bridesmaids and the correct order of the speeches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1278" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486957427.jpg" alt="I do." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These belong to our culture’s current way of expressing the notion that a wedding is an important event in terms of the success of a marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the results don’t seem very encouraging: the link between the quality of the wedding and that of the subsequent relationship is tenuous at best. However grand the ceremony might be, marriages break down at an alarming – yet predictable – rate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1279" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1902387a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we know as the wedding day emerged historically out of a variety of motives: it was an event designed to show off one’s status, to embed one in the community, to invite God to witness one’s union… These ambitions don’t now feel particularly relevant. Therefore, it’s sometimes argued that we don’t need wedding ceremonies at all. Let’s junk the whole idea. We don’t need to waste so much money and go to so much trouble. A piece of paper at the registry office would be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this seems to overlook the benefit of rituals. In theory, rituals serve a hugely important function, for they orchestrate and give public expression to a sequence of emotions and actions that it would be too tricky for any one set of individuals to arrive at on their own. They give structure to interior life – and best reveal their advantages in religious rituals like the Jewish Day of Atonement or the period of mourning known as ‘iddah’ following a Muslim funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90982750.jpg" alt="Ultra-Orthodox Jews Perform Tashlich Ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that the wedding day is – in its current form – an appallingly badly designed ritual. It needs a thorough overhaul, guided by a mature, modern understanding of the underlying purpose of the occasion, which is simply to help a marriage go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, redesigning wedding days sounds odd. We fully accept redesigns and novelty when it comes to technology. No one would think it was a good idea to keep driving a hundred-year-old car. Yet when we’re dealing with social practices, we strangely cling to the ancient with deluded fervour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4315" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg?resize=635%2C488" alt="Back View Of Car With &quot;Just Married&quot; Sign." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do so out of fear: because marriage is such an uncertain business, we quell our anxieties by following what people have always done, attempting to insure ourselves against some new follies we might commit, but thereby ignoring that marriages have been rather catastrophic throughout history and therefore that sticking stubbornly to precedent has all the wisdom of adhering to the methods of medieval plumbing or brain surgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In redesigning the wedding day, we should wipe the slate clean and ask simply: what kind of ceremony would help a marriage to survive? How could one design a day that would make a proper contribution to the maintenance of a union?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The need for new vows</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vows are promises we make on behalf of people who don’t yet exist about circumstances that we can’t yet fully imagine. Still, they serve an important function in at least attempting to guide our responses to the tensions of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with current vows is their optimism, which should be radically tempered, so as to avoid rage and resentment. Vows should accurately anticipate what will make us want to get divorced – and confirm to us that our subsequent sadness will not be an unusual or personal curse. Here is a selection of vows that would be made by a couple in the utopia:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I accept that I am – in countless ways I don’t yet know – very hard to live with.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>We accept not to panic when, some years from now, what we are doing today will seem like the worst decision of our lives.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When you are mean, when you call me a c*** and a fucking bastard, I will strive to remember that at heart, it is because you are hurt – not that you are fundamentally nasty.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Everyone has some very significant things wrong with them. We promise not to look around. There isn’t anyone better out there really. Once you get to know them, everyone is impossible.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1282" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158035124.jpg" alt="Same-Sex Couples Legally Wed in Seattle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Being allowed never to insert one’s penis into a new person, or have someone else new insert their penis into oneself, is one of the tragedies of existence. I apologise that my jealousy and your jealousy have made this peculiar, but entirely necessary self-immolation necessary.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Silence from the audience, followed by a melancholy rendition of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater, during which an asparagus and a lemon, symbols of free sexuality are buried in a three-metre-deep hole in the ground covered with marble or concrete.]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple then repeats: <i>We accept to witness the slow death of our sexuality. We realise we won’t be doing it that often from now on.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I won’t have affairs, not because you’re so perfect, but because I’ve decided to be disappointed by you, and you alone, and you’ll be disappointed by me, and me alone, rather than both of us foisting our troubled selves on innocent members of the community, who would be deeply annoying too once one got to know them.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>[In unison with the audience] Many days we’ll be unhappy; many days, we’ll suffer, many days we’ll regret we ever did this crazy thing. It’s not congratulations we need, it’s commiserations.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Lots of guests</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a growing trend, often driven by financial concerns, towards slightly smaller weddings but a big crowd is, in fact, supremely important (even if the budget only stretches to a sandwich for them later).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One needs a maximum number of people there for a simple reason: so as to cause maximum embarrassment in years to come at the idea of having to call them all up and announce news of divorce. The larger the crowd, the slower one will be to pick up the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/120209645.jpg" alt="Guests arrive for the wedding between En" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This gives due recognition to an important fact about marriage: it’s a social institution, in which we often stay for reasons that go way beyond our own emotional desires. It involves us, but it’s not just about us. It’s about the dog, the children, the grandparents, the friends who got married in imitation of us and whose own relationships would suffer if we split… This sense it isn’t just about us should come as a huge source of relief. There’s nothing harder than to be required to be happy in and for ourselves. What relief to know we will, with time, also be living for others and that our own frame of mind won’t always be such a big deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Different sorts of presents</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian Wedding, the guests would offer the couple different sorts of presents. Primarily, they would arrive with accounts of why their own marriages were difficult and why they were themselves awkward people to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1284" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76590233.jpg" alt="Wedding Ceremony Of Hong Kong Actor Lawrence Ng Kai Wah" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing makes us happier than news of the troubles of others, as these presents would implicitly recognise. At dark moments in the marriage, one would turn to these gifts and flip through descriptions of the marital troubles of one’s friends and relatives – and would come away feeling that one was cursed certainly, but – importantly – in no way alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If single guests were unable to produce such things, they would arrive with vouchers for couples’ therapy, to contribute to the enormous sum that will have to be spent on therapy over the lifetime of any decent marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Speeches</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A typical marriage recognises the key role of parents and gives them a platform. The father of the bride often makes an elaborate speech telling the world how great his daughter is. This is sweet, but in no way protects the daughter he claims to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1285" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1284280a.jpg" alt="USA Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/West Coast Surfer/Mood Board</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents are in command of some vital information that can help a marriage. They know how disturbed they themselves are and the particular family patterns of emotional neuroses which they have witnessed and then unleashed on their own children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wedding day offers a stellar opportunity for the parents of both the bride and the groom to stand up and address their children and their friends on the subject of: ‘The particular ways in which we have messed up the children.’ There would be an added speech on the topic of: ‘How we think our children will be hard to live with, given what we know of them.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This will be crucial information, far surpassing childhood photos and home movies in utility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: A certificate of marriage worthiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, you would get married by a philosopher/psychoanalyst (rather than the two useless current figures, a priest or a local government official). The wedding ceremony would be a passing out celebration for a couple who had been through a substantial course (no less than 12 months) of self-knowledge and mutual education in the psychology of relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic culture suggests that relationships are essentially founded on emotional states: like tenderness, the feeling of missing the other person and sexual passion. This is evidently reckless and in the utopia, there would be a new more logical, classical approach which would recommend strenuous conscious attempts to achieve a mature understanding of love. Many of the skills of marriage would overlap with those of a bomb disposal expert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1286" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/71083487.jpg" alt="Atomic Cake" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the wedding day would be like a graduation ceremony, a culmination of a year of intense study of one of the trickiest and most academic subjects in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Symbols</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The symbols currently associated with marriage (silver horseshoes, bells, white dresses, confetti) can seem to fall somewhere between the merely charming and the obviously superstitious. Few people feel a bridal veil offers robust protection against evil spirits. It’s tempting to think we should jettison symbolism entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the point of a symbol is to make an idea stick in your mind. In the Utopia, the couple would accept small sealed boxes from each other. The box would represent the idea that there will be parts of the other person one will not understand – or perhaps even know – and yet one will have to accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4316" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="William Holden Hiding Present From Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The box would be accompanied by a ‘Tolstoy’ – a brief, but very honest, confession of one’s failings and weaknesses. The Russian novelist gave his wife a written account of his earlier sexual life and an ample description of the flaws of his character, so she would know what she was letting herself in for. The content would be prepared and discussed in the lead up to the marriage; the book would stand for the willingness to listen to – and bear with – one’s partner’s troubles. The exchange of Tolstoys would symbolise a shared ability to cope with the other person’s confusion and distress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Wedding photos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of photos is to bottle the essence of the wedding and make it available to us when we need it later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1288" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1042074x-1.jpg" alt="Carolyn and Fabio wed in the remote village of Airor on the Knoydart Peninsula in the Scottish Highlands, Britain  - 11 Nov 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a wedding album should not only or even primarily be a visual record of a particular day, and evidence of who was in attendance. The task of the photographer is to create a series of works of art, made on many days, and perhaps not at all on the day of the wedding itself, that would remind the couple of answers to some key questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(i) Why did we get together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(ii) What virtues did we see in one another when we got married?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iii) What impact does each person’s family have on the relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iv) How normal are marital problems in society at large?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking back at one’s ‘wedding photos’ in subsequent years would then take its place within the overall purpose of the wedding: it would help, in a small way, to persuade us to stay married.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a wedding – and the elaborate rituals that surround it – do not at present have our real needs in focus. But that doesn’t mean to say that we’d be better off jettisoning the whole ceremony. We still need ceremony and institutions, just better ones. We should take very seriously – and be collectively ambitious about – what wedding days could and should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian thinking sounds like dreamy stuff. But in truth, one of the uses of Utopian thinking is to move us away from silly fantasy. Instead of seeing the ‘dream wedding’ in terms of palm trees and infinity pools, we should be asking what a wedding would be like if it properly helped marriages to go better. That should give us inspiration as we set about reforming the mediocre marriage practices we currently have</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re used to the idea that a year should be punctuated by a sequence of special public days: Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, some kind of national day, May Day, the August Bank holiday etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we’re not – collectively – very ambitious about the role of such occasions. They can be charming, they can be sweet, they can be (at times) rather touching. But, on the whole, we don’t take them terribly seriously and don’t expect others to. We can easily become slightly cynical and see them in terms simply of added sales of cards and confectionary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1294" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156238289.jpg" alt="GERMANY-XMAS-CHRISTMAS-SANTA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This – however – is  a missed opportunity. The quiet scepticism we feel towards the existing calendar of festivals doesn’t show that public days have no powerful contribution to make to the development and maintenance of a good society. They’re evidence of a semi-conscious, and very accurate awareness, that we could do a lot better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In essence, festivals originated as solutions to collective problems. Trooping the Colour (one Saturday in June since 1748) is an event designed to relieve public worry about the army’s loyalty to the British sovereign. There was a time when it was clearly very important indeed for the British population as a whole to be able to witness soldiers demonstrating their allegiance to the crown (and not to a rival political faction). But as such reassurance falls low on the agenda of public needs, that public festival loses its real purpose. It remains picturesque but it (rightly) doesn’t feel as if it really matters. On an even grander scale, something similar has happened around Easter. Easter Sunday originated as as public festival of the triumph of divine love over death: Jesus had been crucified and restored to life on the third day; and the point of the occasion was to keep that world-altering event at the forefront of everyone’s mind. But as Christian dominion recedes in people’s inner lives, Easter Sunday becomes a charming, but unfocused, day of chocolate indulgence and painted eggs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1295" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/164559732.jpg" alt="Man Decorates Tree With 10,000 Easter Eggs" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, there would still be public holidays, but they’d be thought through more rigorously, expressly designed to work a therapeutic, conciliatory effect on society as a whole. The idea of designing festivals automatically sets off alarm bells in the minds of a contemporary liberal audience, who have been taught to think of East Germany and Russia at this point – but these unfortunate examples should not persuade us that good public holidays are somehow designed by history or nature and can hence never be changed. Throughout the ages, people have expressly designed events: the challenge is to do it well, rather than insist it can’t be done at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are seven kinds of public holiday that might be evolved to address some of the core collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: National Pride</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1297" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144081759.jpg" alt="People with hands raised for We are the World ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely beneficial to be able to feel enthusiastic and committed to one’s society; to feel reassured by membership of an admirable community. Collective pride takes the burden of self-regard off the individual ego. We don’t have to do it all ourselves. We can belong to something better and greater than we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, pride is constantly undermined by a media that – quite rightly – wants to point out (and makes money from pointing out) just what is so wrong with our countries. It is easy to come away from the media believing that our societies are nothing but a narrow collection of violent maniacs, paedophiles, corrupt politicians and venal business people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1299" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/169763866.jpg" alt="BRITAIN-POLITCS-BNP-PROTEST" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">The truth will, in the countries where this publication is predominantly being read (the United States, mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea) be very different indeed. To spend a day focusing on what’s good shouldn’t sap the will for critical self-examination; it can be a vital corrective to an impulse simply to denigrate. It can stop us being so spoilt about the genuine but forgotten merits of our lands.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the emphasis should fall on the forgotten aspects of national accomplishment. The fear is always of jingoism and militarism, in other words, that we’ll feel proud of things that aren’t worthy of regard. Yet the fact that people have often felt proud of the wrong things shouldn’t be an argument against national pride per se. The desire to feel proud of the group is an ineradicable feature, and we ignore it at our peril. To castigate it merely leaves it unattended, prone to latch onto inappropriate targets. The challenge isn’t to banish pride, but to channel it in optimal directions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a utopia, a national day would focus not on the things people already identify as impressive. In Germany, for instance, there wouldn’t be a big celebration of their footballing excellence: it’s not needed. The Netherlands is not in urgent need of a day to remember how great it is at cultivating tulips. The United States needs no further reminders of its military strength.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather, it is those things which have a genuinely admirable side, but which we are prone to ignore or underplay that need encouragement. Thus the Dutch might have Normal Day on which they feel proud of their interest in a dignified ordinary life. The British, overwhelmed by the callousness, pessimism and cynicism of their national media, would celebrate their capacity for politeness, optimism and energy. The United States, so practiced at overwhelming power, would celebrate the local and the small-scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1301" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/98728064.jpg" alt="US President Barack Obama(C) visits a lo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than cheer at politicians or the fly-by of aircraft, national pride would be directed at things like the national electricity grid, parents with children under three, tunnelling engineers, locomotive drivers, accountants (and the forgotten good they perform), those everywhere who forbear and forgive, prisoners who repent, the makers of simple, honest household goods, cardiac surgeons…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose of the national day shouldn’t be to celebrate what already goes quite well. It would be to highlight the fragile but best tendencies of the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Carnival</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most prosperous societies project powerful constraints on public behaviour. There is huge emphasis placed upon being responsible, reliable and in control of one’s desires. Particularly around sex. Energy and ambition have been channelled into work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are terrible costs to all this. Our picture of normality becomes crushing. It does not acknowledge the darker sides of our characters, it keeps us too tightly harnessed. Many of us therefore blow up at random moments. We can’t take the discipline any more. We do something a little crazy and can pay a very heavy price as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good societies know about our more chaotic sides and are keen to channel rather than repress them. That is the function of Carnival in the Utopia. Carnival night would be a small moment in the year collectively devoted to the unconstrained libido.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1302" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/139113371.jpg" alt="Brazil Begins Carnival Celebration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After 3pm, everyone (however blissful their relationship) would be expected to get slightly drunk and to head out without their partner; all the clubs would have been commandeered for the night by the state; eye masks would be distributed on buses and trains. One would be encouraged to start talking to anyone at all, one could join a mass of writhing naked bodies or present oneself to be flogged; or kiss whomever happened to be nearby. As the night progressed, it would all get more and more frantic. Until, towards dawn, sirens would sound. Everything would have to stop and the world would return to normal. Special buses would take people home; asking someone what they had done that night would be as impolite and taboo as requesting to know the contents of their will. Serene music would be played on the radio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The festival would offer protection against feelings of shame. Our picture of normality would become more realistic and more sane. Our vagabond urges wouldn’t have such disastrous consequences. We would end up kinder to others – and to ourselves – until the next Carnival night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Resentment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We get driven quietly demented by other people. There are things we resent about our parents, partners, children. The stored up agitation and frustration festers. We find indirect, subtle ways of punishing others for the things that upset us. We’re too polite, cautious and worried about hurting others to do much about these things. But relationships get awkward and difficult and bitterness can take hold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1304" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3376599.jpg" alt="Lover's Chat" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resentment Day is designed to help us deal with this kind of situation. On this special day, there would be permission – in fact a requirement – to explain the basis of all of one’s resentments to other people. Half the time, you would be on the receiving end and this would mean having to be patient and entirely without any desire for vengeance. There would be huge investment in the role of listening to the painful things others articulate. The day’s heros would be the listeners. One would not be allowed to shout, or accuse back or get furious or run away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resentment Day would end with public ceremonies focused on the elemental griefs of the human condition. It would be collectively asserted that: we are all always anxious; are never fully understood; always carry a pang of loneliness; have potential that is never adequately realised; squander our chances and learn only too late what we should have valued when we had the chance. It is a ceremony to contain and reset our individual dissatisfactions with one another. At midnight, the sky over every city would be illuminated with fireworks which spelt out the closing message: why weep over particular sorrows when the whole of life calls for tears?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Revelation Day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Revelation Day, we would be entitled – actually required – to tell those close to us something that we’d like them to know but which normally we resist saying – because we fear their reaction. It would be a condition that the other person couldn’t get furious or vindictive, whatever it was. They would have to listen patiently. A typical revelation gift would be a fifteen-minute hour glass – because this is how long the other would be required to listen in silence. Then, of course, one would have to hear the revelations of other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2536968847_fcb2788a58_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6870" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2536968847_fcb2788a58_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="2536968847_fcb2788a58_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’d be tears along the way. It would be hard at moments. We’d learn some fascinating and distressing things: about infidelity, addictions, lies, betrayals… And yet many people would find that the day would end with enthusiastic love making. The cultural assumptions around Revelation Day would be that it was not to do with breaking up or with seeking to cause the other pain. Telling others would be a mark of great trust – and acceptance would be utterly heroic. There would be pervasive social pressure to use the opportunity in good faith. Occasionally people would get stigmatised as Revelation Day abusers – a hard reputation to live down. For the most part, the day would be cherished as an occasion to reveal and properly accept each other’s humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is so full of demands, one is so much at risk of being depleted and over-strained, that it’s entirely understandable that we restrict the circle of people with whom we identify.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But on Empathy Day, there would be a deliberate, highly social attempt to change our habits. A central premise of Empathy Day would be that we find it quite hard to see where we are excessively negative and hostile about a particular group of people. Lack of empathy often lurks behind what feel like rational condemnations. So a crucial moment in this would be a diagnostic test – which would usually be done in the morning. All media outlets would be required by law to promote the test. On whom is one tempted to look down? For what groups does one reserve special ire? For some there would be an urgent need to develop empathy with marginal and disadvantaged groups. But for others, this might not be where empathy was currently lacking. They might find that it was deadbeat dads (or rich socialists or Evangelical Christians, or ultra-orthodox Jews or people who like Kim Kardashian or support the Muslim Brotherhood) that they loathed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1307" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145700381.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian Hosts Hard Rock Hotel's Hottest Party - Rehab Sundays" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© WireImage</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of empathy would not be that one started to feel particularly sorry for the other group. Or started to admire them. Empathy is about the possibility of identification. When you empathise you don’t necessarily agree at all. But you do see how someone can be human, can be a bit like you, and end up where they are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Empathy generates self-knowledge and a more accurate perception of the world. Empathy is a cure for the blindness that commitment to certain causes risks bringing with it. Someone wanting to change public attitudes to the melting of the polar ice would – on Empathy Day – be helped to recognise from the inside how boring and annoying their concerns could feel to someone else. On Empathy Day, you would be asked to describe (without being snide or ironic) why it would be attractive to support a political movement that currently appalled you or left you cold. Empathy Day would amount to a thrilling day of travel into obscure territory, the minds of those who scare you or leave you indifferent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Stoic Day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On this day, people would collectively try out exposing themselves – in imagination – to the most frightening scenarios. For a day, the whole nation would submit to austerity rations pegged to the living standards of the poorest nation on earth (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Everyone would have to wash their own clothes by hand. Clingy people would try out living alone. There would be exercises in self-reliance. Central heating and air conditioning would be forbidden. The news would be dominated by stories of what goes on in palliative care units and hospices. Prominent figures would make speeches about the brevity of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/457461829.jpg" alt="Aging Prisoners Make Up Fastest Growing Segment Of Nation's Prison Population" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point would be to accommodate ourselves to the pains and sorrows which may and will come our way. Its aim would be to cultivate a species of courage. What we know always has less power over our imaginations. But the bigger payoff of the day would be a greater appreciation of things we had come to take for granted. For a little while at least after the day, we would be properly grateful for our advantages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would be a sequence of events across the year which would help us keep our troubles, disappointments (and hopes) in proportion. A central event in this festival would be Cloud Day, an annual event which would take place early in the evening on 2nd October. Everyone would take time (usually around fifteen minutes) to contemplate the sky. There would be quite a bit of build up; celebrities would discuss their favourite kinds of clouds and why these mean so much to them and what they are hoping to see this year. The elderly would reminisce about the spectacular 1981 cumulonimbus. Young people would be earnestly instructed on appropriate behaviour and how to cultivate the correct inward attitude. We’d learn to put our troubles up against a broader canvas – and feel their weight and size diminish accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1311" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/146143856.jpg" alt="Sunset with Clouds" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than feel embarrassed about collective events, the Utopian society would recognise that we need help in scheduling certain emotions and attitudes. We might agree with these in theory, but privately, don’t get around to emphasising them sufficiently. The festivals would take care of this for us: they would make sure that we were regularly brought into contact with dispositions that we most need in order to thrive, tolerate one another and face the great challenges of existence.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We generally hold culture – by which we understand art, museums, cinema, literature and the study of history – in extremely high regard. But, equally, we tend not to look very closely at why culture has such prestige. In fact, we are encouraged to think it is unsophisticated, even vulgar, to ask what culture is <i>for</i>. And yet, as it will be argued here, this is a question that no society should shun – for an enormous task lies before culture if only it can become conscious of its true purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7832" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Maurice Li Photography</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The present ‘guardians of culture’ – art and literary critics employed by media organisations, professors in the humanities and museum curators – are deeply devoted to the idea that art should exist ‘for art’s sake.’ This idea achieved dominance in the late nineteenth century and continues to determine the frame through which we (largely unknowingly) view culture. It dictates that culture should never be appropriated for practical or ideological ends. The theory was meant to release culture from the clutches of three tainted forces – religion, politics and commerce – each of which was deemed to want something rather too urgent and practical from cultural creators. In flight from these forces, critics asserted that culture was to be kept free of any sort of clearly stated ‘goal’ or ‘end’. It should exist in its own sphere and not be asked to ‘do’ anything much in the world (as religions, political parties and certain pre-modern societies, especially those of Greece and Rome, had explicitly asked it to). On the back of this idea were born all kinds of notions that persist to this day: the veneration of ambiguity and paradox (witnessed in elite discussions of contemporary art), the disdain for clear unironic ideological pronouncements on the part of artists as to their role in society (compare the suspicion directed at Tolstoy’s rallying cries compared with the elite enthusiasm for Marina Abramovic’s gnomic pronouncements), the preference for studying the formal qualities of literary texts as opposed to their meaning (it sounds absurd to suppose that Proust might change our lives), the ridicule directed at anyone who might study history ‘to learn lessons from the past’ (which was the whole pre-modern point of history) and the constant assertions that the point of culture is merely to raise questions rather than find answers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7830" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg?resize=400%2C567" alt="L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It should be added that this is not generally how artists themselves have seen their purpose. George Eliot, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, Heidegger, Picasso and George Orwell, to name but a few, would all have begged to differ. The point is that the guardians of culture in whose hands their work rests have carefully stripped these voices of their more urgent and utilitarian aims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, however, the idea of culture as a practical force would be taken very seriously indeed. It would be recognised what a historical anomaly the idea of ‘art for art’s sake’ has been, running counter to centuries of historic mainstream thinking about the purpose of art. Almost all the art and culture that is to be found in museums, art galleries and libraries was produced by people who believed that art had a purpose which could be stated thus: it was meant to teach us how to be wise, self-aware, kind and reconciled to the darkest aspects of reality. The anti-utilitarian view is a rejection of more than 2,000 years of philosophising on the practical role of the arts.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was Aristotle who shaped the mindset of the West by proposing that watching tragedies was first and foremost <i>useful</i> – useful in shaking us free of self-righteousness, prejudice and moral blindness. In the amphitheatres of Attica, one would be invited to see how easily a hero might make a small error and then pay a huge price for it, a spectacle that would induce fear and pity in audiences, leaving them readier to forgive others and better able to examine their own consciences. As Nietzsche emphasised in his <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> (a powerful rehearsal of the Greek argument as to the utility of the arts), Aristotle insists that drama should be entrusted with the core social role of educating the emotions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Likewise, in the 19th century, Hegel rejected the idea of ‘art for art’s sake’, proposing that painting, music, architecture, literature and design all had major missions to perform. We need them, he suggested, so that important insights can become properly powerful in our lives. Art is ‘the sensuous presentation of ideas’. The point of art, Hegel, realises, is not so much to come up with startlingly new or strange ideas; but to take the good, important, helpful thoughts we often already know and make them stick in our minds.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, culture would be given a single, ambitious role: to function as a form of therapy. The various branches of culture would serve the same purpose in different ways: they would all compensate for our natural weaknesses and emotional frailties, they would guide, correct and encourage us, they would open our eyes and console us for our griefs, so that with their help we might become better versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, there is almost always a knee-jerk response on the part of critics to suggestions of the therapeutic within the cultural sphere: ‘The idea that art should help people to live is a piece of babyish absurdity we should all have grown out of long ago’ according to a statement in the<i>Guardian</i>;  ‘Reducing art to self-help is the greatest imaginable insult to the masterpieces of culture’ echoed the <i>New York Times</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4513954866_2f34b3e251_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7828" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4513954866_2f34b3e251_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4513954866_2f34b3e251_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the problem is that we’ve become confused about the basic meaning of the word therapy. A therapy is a treatment intended to help a person to function well. It might be a medical therapy: a vaccination that strengthens our resistance to disease or an intervention that cures an ailment. But equally, the idea of therapy applies to the mind. Therapy, in this core sense, is the deliberate attempt to help us to lead better lives. To suggest that a person does not stand in need of the therapeutic flies in the face of everything we know about human psychology in general – and ourselves in particular.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of art for art’s sake was originally motivated by a noble desire to honour culture, to say how special and important its fields were in a world sullied by meaner, utilitarian aims. Yet, inadvertently, this entrenched view has come to stand in the way of a full engagement with culture, suggesting that its disciplines should not in fact be consequential in the world; that they should not guide our beliefs or shape our habits; that they should not be appreciated for their wisdom or consoling power – for this would be to ‘use’ them…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4318" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain.png?resize=635%2C509" alt="The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the prestige which culture currently enjoys has been won at the expense of another field of human experience, the status of which has declined in direct relation to the rise in the status of art: religion. From the middle of the 19th century onwards, many people (Matthew Arnold, Nietzsche, Heidegger among them) came to the view that, as religion weakened its hold on society and upon people’s inner lives, it would be culture that could step in and perform many of the same roles as the faiths. Culture too could guide, exhort, reassure, console, inspire and censure. It was with this big ambition in mind that a period of vast investment in culture (in museums, in art galleries, in opera houses and libraries) proceeded. Culture would replace scripture. The great institutions of culture – the galleries and the universities – would be the new Cathedrals of Christendom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In truth, art really can do for us a remarkable number of the very things that religion once did. Culture truly is in a position to replace many of the functions of scripture. Art too has the power to console us, it too can bring meaning and purpose, it too can increase our powers of empathy and generate a sense of community.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1513" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1564580a.jpg" alt="England" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Eye Ubiquitous</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in practice, we tend to pay only lip-service to these ideas. You used to go to the cathedral for some clear reasons: because you wanted to save your soul, because you were looking for comfort, you needed community, you wanted to develop your moral character or you were hoping for consolation and redemption. But if you turned up at a gallery or a university arts faculty with similarly intense, focused concerns, you would be considered very strange, regarded with suspicion and perhaps even declared insane.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, in a wise and mature society, the therapeutic resources of culture would be taken very seriously. The visual arts, architecture, the humanities, galleries and museums would be deployed to help us cope with our troubles and to flourish, both individually and collectively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In universities, the past would no longer be studied under the banner of ‘history’, novels would not be read in ‘literature’ courses, there wouldn’t be a category called ‘art history’. Instead, students would enrol in classes whose psychological purpose was evident, perhaps ones with titles like <i>The Role of Error</i>; <i>The Need for Status</i>; <i>The Sorrows of Love </i>and <i>The Challenges of Mortality</i>. Art galleries would similarly be reorganised to track our true needs. Instead of grouping works according to where they happened to have been produced and when, they would be grouped according to the human needs they best addressed. Instead of a room devoted to 18th-century French painting, one would find ones titled <i>Anxiety </i>or<i> Envy</i>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Utopian government would be similarly ambitious for film, the most influential of all art forms. It would, for example, focus on the classification of films. Instead of just suggesting that one needed to be above a particular age to watch a film, the government classification board would see its primary task as that of helping a film to reach the audiences it was in an optimal position to help. Thus a film might be rated A, meaning that it was regarded as being good at getting us to address and cope with Anxiety. Or it could have an MC rating, meaning that it was of benefit to those experiencing Marital Conflict. In the Utopia, films would be expected not only to entertain us (and ease the pains of long flights), they would be appreciated – and used – for their ability to better direct our feelings of sympathy, offer comfort for our unmanageable fears, correct an unworkable sense of what is normal, edge us towards good conduct and arm us against our follies and vices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key concerns, in the Utopian society, would be with topping up the therapeutic effects of cultural experiences. Our insights fade. It may be that at 8am, having just had a cup of coffee and walked across the park from the station to work, we are ready to look with patience on the flaws of our colleagues; but by midday this benign attitude may have become seriously frayed. An ideal society would be acutely aware of this risk, so it would make sure that we were likely to encounter reminders at regular points through the day – as religions once did. When we nipped out to get a sandwich at lunchtime, we might be confronted by a work of art articulating themes of kindness and empathy. Or we might participate in a quick cloud-watching event, restoring (briefly) a more mature perspective on the harried demands of the afternoon.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, and to put it with deliberate bluntness, the great works of culture amount to a giant ‘how to’ manual that a society writes for itself. At present, the manual has been muted and its power fatefully constrained. The messages we hear most days have been written by advertisers and corporations – while the guardians of culture have prevented their medium from shaping mass consciousness, fearful that culture’s supposed commitment to ambiguity and paradox might be damaged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the future, the resources of the public environment – buildings, institutions, events and educators – would ideally all be organised for the sake of helping us to lead better lives, guided by a recognition of the real troubles we face and by a grand and ancient ambition that culture should support our better natures.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collectively, we recognise that film has an astonishing power to induce emotion: it can reliably make millions of us weep, feel terror or relief, be elevated or downcast. It is a massive engine for getting and holding our attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it would sound very weird to stop and ask what film was really for, what purpose it serves in our societies and why we spend so much time in its presence. That’s because we don’t generally think of films as serving any very strenuous or serious cause. We might point out that films aim to be great entertainment, make money at the box office and – occasionally – present us with a controversial idea. We ask for a lot of nice but not terribly consequential things of films: to while away the hours of an intercontinental flight, to keep the family together on the sofa, to give us a bit of a thrill…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7838" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is reflected in the way we typically categorise films according to nothing more profound than the basic premise of their storylines (adventure, fantasy, disaster, road, sci-fi etc.) or according to the general emotions they produce: comedy, horror, romance. Or we take note of the kind of audiences at which they seem aimed: chick flick, guys’ films, women’s weepers, family-oriented…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this is a great loss for us and for cinema itself. Watching films has become so profoundly familiar in our society, we have lost sight of just how strange, remarkable and consequential this activity truly is. We have come to take cinema so for granted, we don’t wonder how we might use it to benefit our lives in a properly profound way. Ideally, we would get more ambitious about the role of cinema in the world. We would try to pin down more accurately what films can actually do for us, then make sure we’re reliably making, and finding our way to seeing, the best (that is, the most useful) kinds of films: the films that really do help us with our struggles and pains. We would, ideally, learn that film – like all the other art forms – best reveals its power when we conceive of it as a kind of therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This idea isn’t new. It comes from the Ancient Greeks who brought maturity to the predecessor of cinema: theatre. Fascinatingly, they didn’t just file going to the theatre under ‘entertainment’ and leave it at that. They thought very deeply about what the point of sitting in a theatre might be and concluded that it should be a <i>therapeía</i>, a resource to help us grow into better, wiser, more mature kinds of people. It belonged, together with religion and philosophy, to the forces that could develop our souls. Aristotle proposed that watching tragedies was highly useful in shaking us free of self-righteousness. Seeing how easily a hero might make a small error and then pay a huge price for it could induce fear and pity in the audience, leaving us readier to forgive others and better able to examine our own consciences.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to film, we should get back to the practical spirit of the Ancient Greeks. We too should learn to assign functions to films according to their specific capacities. Films have it in their power to compensate us for a range of weaknesses in our nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider six key problems – and how films might be of help:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem One: We take our troubles too seriously</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are understandably prone to self-pity; we get ground down and frustrated by the problems life throws at us. And we tend to react by insisting in ever more rigid and solemn ways on the necessary correctness of our own outlook. We can be hard to live with, lonely, defensive, proud and brittle inside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1265" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3878176i.jpg" alt="Archipelago - 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Kino International/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certain films can beautifully address this natural tendency when they show us people not too different from ourselves in difficult situations which feel rather familiar. It’s someone a bit like us who is dealing with spouses, the challenges of dating, money worries, travelling for business, health anxieties, bosses, children, in-laws… Except, very much unlike us, a film can play these for laughs. It seeks the absurd side of the exact things we normally greet with excessive seriousness. The film attempts to do something wonderfully useful (and very hard): teach us to laugh at ourselves and restore perspective to our troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At their best, there’s nothing trivial about these comedies at all. They take on the momentous task of sweetly edging us towards being slightly nicer to live around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Two: We’re not careful enough</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a terrible, occasional trauma of life that some actions that seem quite small go on to have horrible consequences. You tell a little lie. You steal a tiny bit. You’re a bit dishonest with someone. You get a bit lustful and carried away, just once… And then, from this, problems can grow and spiral into catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Films can help us by speeding up time and showing us in a matter of hours the fearsome result of what we might originally have thought of as small failings. A film can push the consequences to the maximum: it shows what happens when trust is eroded in a relationship, when an enemy is vindictively crushed (rather than spared), when one tries to deny something another person knows…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1266" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3659754k.jpg" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - Jan 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Moviestore</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The film can provide us not only with alarm bells. By witnessing horror and disaster, it can make us want to be the kind of person who is a touch more forthright, a little more honest and moral, readier to face an unpleasant moment now and (thereby) head off a distant disaster. We leave the cinema less inclined to be self-righteous about the failings of others, scared for ourselves and more respectful towards things we hold dear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Three: Ordinary life seems boring</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might sound odd, but it’s usually very healthy and helpful to feel that one’s life is a bit special; deserving of admiration and respect, a little glamorous. But very often, the opposite is the case. Glamour lies elsewhere: in the lives of the famous, in swankier parts of town, in activities and jobs far removed from our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film has an enormous power to glamourise. It can put in front of our eyes delightful images many metres in size, shot in extraordinary colours, vivid and immediate. Because so many films glamourise the wrong things, we’re used to thinking that an element of alienation and corruption is a generic rather than an incidental danger of cinema.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1267" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2014102i.jpg" alt="'Happy-Go-Lucky' Film - 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Snap Stills</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in fact, film is well able to show us the less obvious but real charms of everyday life. Whereas the worst sort of films eject us back into our lives full of longing and disenchantment, the best ones leave us ready to re-engage with circumstances with which we had unfairly grown bored. Cinema can help us love and appreciate what we already have. It might be a film about an ordinary school teacher who we, the audience, realise is delightful; we see the deep charm of the sandwich lunch she has looking out at a beautiful patch of grass near a motorway junction. We’re moved when, on Saturday, she buys a new lampshade. There’s a fabulous episode when she buys an old car and goes camping in North Yorkshire. We’re taught how to see the very real dignity and grace of ordinary life. And we recognise that a little of that, fairly, belongs to us as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Four: Other cultures are weird and scary</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not entirely our own fault. The media is to blame for much of it, for it tells us about categories of people we want to have nothing to do with, places that seem frightening, bizarre, scary, unremittingly depressing. We grow to think we’re not at all interested in people in Iran or Venezuela, a local sink estate or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our disenchantment may get expressed as racism or class arrogance – or, just plain coldness. Ultimately, what we suffer from is a denial of our common humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1268" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1128692a-1.jpg" alt="'Ten' film - 2002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/c. Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema can perfectly compensate for this withdrawal of emotional energy by showing us the appeal of people we’d otherwise be uninterested in. One might be shown the sweet manners of a family living in abject poverty a few miles east of our own home; or a woman making the best of it in Tehran, finding ways of supporting her family and displaying a bravery and loyalty we can relate to. We are offered insights into ways in which – close up – people elsewhere might be very similar to oneself, even over there, in Kinshasa or Nairobi. They might fuss in the same way, or be offended by the same things that bother you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the highest artistry, we’re reminded of an obvious but so easily forgotten fact: our membership of the family of man.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Five: Excessive timidity, failure of ambition and nerve</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve gone so far down the track of teaching ourselves about the importance of gentleness and compromise, many of us have unwittingly developed a problem around certain forms of self-assertion and resistance to the demands of others. Decent people have learned all too well to suppress their own appetite for a fight, their own desire for victory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in a world where conflict is unavoidable, good people sometimes need to strengthen their willingness to face down opposition – not always to compromise and play it safe, but to take risks instead, to get out and fight, to relish victory and to be a bit more ruthless in the service of noble and deeply important ends. Sometimes it is not enough to be right, you also need to win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1269" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1547619a.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So some of us might well benefit from seeing films that tell tales of heroism: that follow someone who has to navigate the world, kill a dragon, outwit some baddies, penetrate a corrupt organisation… The film shouldn’t ideally leave us just in awe at the daring of another. It should do that far more valuable thing: educate us by example so that we too become just a little more heroic and brave where we need to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Six: Immaturity</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard to be an adult in the true sense. We’re immature in so many ways, as we recognise in our more honest moments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, we desperately need accurate, yet bearable, representations of the process of development. We need the constant encouragement of seeing people mess up but then also come to important realisations, forgive, accept complex truths and act less selfishly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1270" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3755098e.jpg" alt="Boyhood - 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/c. IFC Films/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be a father who realises, three quarters of the way through the film, that he no longer wants to frighten and bully his children. Or a spouse who starts to acknowledge how much they have neglected their partner. Or an adolescent who accepts that he can’t always just blame others. Or a lover who gives up chasing those who are unavailable and punishing those who happen to love him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film has the huge task of showing us how we might develop. It gives us role models, human and flawed as we are, who by example leave us a little more able to do what we need to, and yet fear to undertake, in our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Utopian conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically, governments acknowledge the power of cinema in two ways. They seek to foster the film industry by offering financial support and tax breaks. There is a potent – if not clearly defined – pride in having a thriving local film industry. It’s fed by the thought that cinema might in some way help us understand who we are or promote aspects of our better nature. And governments hope to limit any damage that films may do to the national psyche by classifying – and restricting who can view – material according to the level of violence, swearing and sexual activity it contains. This is a distant, tentative acknowledgment of a profound fact: we hope that cinema can be genuinely good for us, and help us live our lives; and we rightly worry that it also has the power to harm and damage us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema, as we currently know it, is not a million miles from doing wonderful things. But in order to help with the real business of living, we need this hugely compelling and powerful art form to set out in a more determined and systematic way to offer us the help we really need.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The way we categorise films should ideally get a little more subtle. Rather than say something was merely a thriller or a comedy, we’d put the accent on what these genres might achieve for their audiences: we’d have a more secure sense of what particular life challenge a film was suited to addressing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of suggesting that one needs to be above a particular age to watch a film, the government classification board would see its primary task as that of helping a film to reach the audience it could best help. Thus a film might be rated A – meaning that it was regarded as being good at getting us to address and cope with Anxiety. Or it could have an MC rating: meaning that it was of benefit to those experiencing Marital Conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classification would not so much recognise the overt content of the film. Rather it would be given in recognition of what should really always be at stake when we take in a movie: the therapeutic power of the work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Films can do so much for us:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they better direct our feelings of sympathy</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they offer comfort for our unmanageable fears</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they correct an unworkable sense of what is normal</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they edge us towards good conduct</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they caution us, and arm us against our folly and vices.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Existing films do not entirely ignore these tasks: they circle round them and make hints but do not focus on them in a systematic or reliable way. In the Utopia, the top films would be:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. The portrayal of ‘an average marriage’ in its seventh year. The couple are deeply committed to each other but find themselves easily irritated, disappointed and at times hostile. The film would be widely praised for its highly realistic, extended argument scenes. This would be a ‘Feel Normal’ film.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. A high adventure film, not unlike James Bond, in which a serious and self-questioning character would, for example, thwart an international terrorist plot. The allure of such films would be traced to the encouragement they would give to integration: the ability to be effective as opposed to merely just nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. A narrative centred on the inner life of an accountant. It would belong to a highly regarded genre of ‘Looking at the Overlooked’. Another example would show the hidden drama and depth in the routines of a structural engineer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. There would be a very popular film set in a hospice, in which several of the leading characters would die. The film would be much liked for offering what would become known as ‘Perspective Moments’. These would help us see our own anxieties and stresses in more manageable proportions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1273" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2056121b.jpg" alt="Amour - 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema is deeply powerful. There’s still a way to go before society as a whole wakes up to what we should properly ask of it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It doesn’t from a distance seem as if philosophy and business would have anything to say to one another. Businesses are concerned with meeting strict targets under time pressure, maximising revenue and outwitting competitors. Philosophy is concerned with the largest and most impractical questions about the meaning of life; it sets itself no targets and has no practical outcomes.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2645" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessA.jpg" alt="(From L. to R.) - Iranian businessman Am" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1">Spot the odd one out: businessman listens to French philosophers</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in reality, business and philosophy have a huge amount to offer one another. Beneath their interest in profits, businesses are forced to engage with nothing less than the issue of how to satisfy their customers, a subject full of contradictions and complexities. For its part, philosophy has spent most of its long history investigating the ingredients of a good life, what Aristotle called eudaimonia, a Greek word translated as ‘flourishing’ or ‘fulfilment’. In their different ways, philosophy and business have to work out how to satisfy people – and therefore how they tick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2646" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessB.jpg" alt="Illustration of Aristotle Teaching a Young Alexander the Great" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The secret to building a great empire: philosophical tutelage</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most businesses outside a tiny crooked minority have to be committed to promoting the flourishing of their customers. Their long-term survival depends on it. Perhaps they’re selling people hand dryers or household insurance, but ultimately, their livelihoods depend on the accuracy with which they have discerned the true needs of those they have set out to serve: profit is the reward for working out the reality of your clients ahead of anyone else. In order to work through the psychology of their clients, businesses commonly rely on market research, carried out for them via focus groups and interviews. But they are typically not stepping back and properly thinking about human nature from a 2,000 year cultural perspective and their analyses of their customers suffer as a result. An ordinary businessman would ask: ‘How do I improve my margins in the ski business?’ But a philosopher would ask: ‘Where is the need to ski rooted in the human soul?’ Eventually the philosopher would find a way back to the balance sheet, but the starting point would be higher and broader and the results often more interesting. With a proper philosophical perspective on the needs of customers, businesses can start to see new market opportunities, rather than merely being left to fiddle with margins, wages and logistics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-010414-businessC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4324" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-010414-businessC.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="Apple Announces iPod Upgrades" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1">Philosophy by other means</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Asked to analyse a business, a philosopher would typically start by asking what the deep purpose of the business was: that is, what its eudaimonic promise to its customers was made up of. Then he or she would look at how well the company was living up to the promise, before delivering suggestions of new products, services or brand messages that would align a company more closely with its implicit promises.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine an ambitious luxurious hotel trying to stay afloat in a competitive market. The hotel would tend to imagine it knew what it needed to do for its customers; the struggle would be all around delivery. However, what tends to be rushed is the definition of what exactly a good night in a hotel actually is. Where do the sheets and the minibar fit into this? What’s the role of the soap and room service? What if one went back to the drawing board about what a hotel is?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessD.jpg" alt="PM-010414-businessD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Treehotel/Brittas Pensionat</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A hotel with imagination</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many problems that can destroy a night in a hotel. Here are some of the ones that tend not to get thought about (they’re too philosophical): one might feel anxious or confused. One might be lonely. One might have an argument with one’s spouse. One might feel disconnected from the culture of the country all around. Typically, hotels don’t think these sort of problems belong to them. They limit their focus to the soap and the bed. In other words, they’re forgetting the full range of implicit promises they’ve made to their customers: you will be happy with us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A hotel that took fulfilment very seriously might be led to develop a whole range of new services and products. Hotels, like so many businesses, are only at the dawn of understanding their customers’ real needs, because they operate with an overly narrow definition of happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar issues bedevil financial services. Take wealth management. On the surface, this is a business that promises customers a certain return a year on their portfolios. But the deeper implicit promise is: ‘you will live well with money around us’. However, very few firms have offerings connected up with this grand claim, rendering them intensely vulnerable to competition and downturns in their financial performance. A wealth management firm under philosophical guidance wouldn’t stop looking after money in the standard ways, but it would also be asking how clients can properly flourish around money. How well are the clients’ children relating to money? How has money affected the clients’ friendships? What is the point of philanthropy? What has been the meaning of their lives? As with the example of the hotel, these are questions that implicitly fall under the remit of a particular business, but the business is not looking at them squarely and imaginatively.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2649" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessE.jpg" alt="Twitter Co-Founder Biz Stone Takes Part In Project Imagination Event" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy incorporated</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Letting the odd philosopher into a business is not an indulgence. It helps management to think more deeply about what a business should properly be trying to do with the customer’s life in order to improve it. There is, fortunately, no enduring conflict between understanding the psyche and making some money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calling an idea ‘utopian’ is normally a way of saying it’s pie-in-the-sky and not worth paying attention to. Far from it. Throughout the ages, a number of philosophers have put forward some highly provocative and interesting utopias, describing ideal arrangements of everything from schools to religion, government to holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian ideas aren’t meant to be immediately practical. That’s precisely why they are so useful: they take our minds off the problems of the here and now and offer us a grander vision of what there is to aim for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is the most powerful and prestigious force in contemporary society, replacing religion as the touchstone of authority and meaning. It is usually the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing we consult at night. What are we searching for? The news does its best to persuade us we must keep up with its agenda – but to what end? What are the ghastly, wondrous, thrilling, destructive, bitter stories for?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It would be most honest to admit that we don’t yet know: we’re still working it out collectively. We’re still among the first generations ever to have had access to news on the current scale and we’re struggling to make sense of the deluge of information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/151981731.jpg" alt="UKRAINE-PRESS-FEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One thing is for sure: we don’t yet have the news we deserve. The news of our times is predominantly an agent of confusion, envy, purposeless excitement and needless terror.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a wiser, more mature society we’d still engage with the news on a daily basis. But we’d have clearer and more ambitious ideas about what we needed it for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News would not simply have the job of keeping us up to speed about anything unusual (or horrific) that happened since the last bulletin. It wouldn’t occasionally claim it was trying to keep the powerful in check (however important this aim). Instead the grand purpose of news would be stated clearly: to help the individual and the nation to flourish – and to bring whatever information to the fore that helped with these twin goals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To carry out this epochal task, the ideal news organisation would bring us some of the following:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Celebrity news</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Serious news organisations are currently highly dismissive of celebrities, and abandon the whole field of celebrity to the lowest outlets, who bring us the celebrities we currently have and know too much about.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But human beings need and will always look for role models. We therefore shouldn’t complain about, or eradicate, ‘celebrity culture.’ We just need to improve it. We need to bring a better kind of person to the fore of public consciousness: we need better celebrities rather than no celebrities at all. Rather than try to suppress our love of celebrity, the news ought to channel it in optimally intelligent and fruitful directions. In the Utopian society, the best-known people (the ones whose parties and holiday photos and clothes and new hairstyles we looked at most often) would also be those who embodied and reinforced the highest, noblest and most socially beneficial values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1478" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90547441.jpg" alt="Baroness Susan Greenfield, Professor of Pharmacology at Oxford University, at British Council, New Delhi." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News outlets would be engaged in identifying and then promoting a raft of original celebrities, whose virtues captured the best sides of human nature. They would pick out for us the clever and kind research scientists, molecular biologists, poets, venture capitalists, mothers, nurses, cleaners and parking attendants, the very many people who would be more appropriate targets of celebrity than those we know today – people whose physiques, attitudes and routines we should constantly have paraded before us through enticing photography and heart-warming anecdotes. A society can only ever be as good as the celebrities it holds before itself. Serious news in the future would know that no functioning society can do without role models.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Disaster News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is currently full of senseless horrors: car crashes, drowned toddlers, fatal lightning strikes and so on. Our senses are numbed by the catastrophes. We don’t know where to place them in our minds. We may be tempted to switch off, unable to process the horror.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1479" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/179561968.jpg" alt="Emergency Services Attend Major Road Accident In Kent" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a key task of the news – in a more mature and wise society – would be to use current events to keep returning to one critical theme: the fragility of life. The incidents of the news that get lumped under the term ‘accidents’ demonstrate repeatedly that the routines, habits, hopes and ordinary bother of life can be severed at any point by an utterly unpredictable – but hideously real – freak event. We need to be drawn back time and again to this profound fact. Stories of car crashes or of trees falling on people walking in parks would, in an ideal news service, still be given plenty of attention. For they have the power not only to stir our fears, but to strengthen our resolve, to appreciate more fully, and use more wisely, the present moment; to reform our priorities and to prompt us to kindness and seriousness today, in case tomorrow never comes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Foreign News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the moment, as far as the news is concerned, countries tend to disappear into their worst moments. There are large parts of the world to which we only pay collective attention when something there goes badly wrong. In theory, we know that ordinary things continue in places associated with terror, hatred and intractable conflict. The cities of Syria or Iraq become suicide bombers and tanks; virulent extremists and wailing mothers. And so we stop caring, which has serious policy implications. Widespread indifference makes diplomatic disengagement inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1480" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/127502977.jpg" alt="A Palestinian woman with her baby walk p" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The route to caring about the extraordinary – which is how whatever is foreign at first appears – is through the ordinary. We need to feel close to the ordinary moments of others’ lives before we can care about what happens to them in their tragedies. This is a brute fact about the mechanics of sympathy which the media has forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The ideal news organisation of the future, would therefore tell us about street parties in Addis Ababa, love in Peru, in-laws in Mongolia and rally-driving in Nablus. By humanising the other audiences would be prepared to care just a little more about the next devastating typhoon, violent coup and appalling cluster bomb.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1481" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/469427727.jpg" alt="PERU-THEME-LOVE-VALENTINE'S DAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to do this the news organisations of the Utopia would need to summon (that is, source, employ and pay for) artists. For they would realise that the task of making the mundane seductive and making the ordinary lives of others reveal their depth and tenderness does not sit neatly with the traditional journalistic ambition of just telling the facts. The critical task of the journalism of the future would be to get people to care about the facts, not just lay them before the world in their brute outlines (as is done today).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Economic News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopian news outlet, economic news would be considered hugely important. It would help us understand why our world is the way it is. It would not be focused so much on what is happening day by day (the stock market is moving erratically, exchange rates are volatile) but on the fact that our lives are governed by money in ways we do not adequately control.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1482" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/104511048.jpg" alt="Income Gap Between Rich And Poor Grows To Record Level" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lying awake at night, for instance, some of us may wonder, in a sincere and yet inarticulate way, why it is that the world built by the immense energy and productive power of capitalism is not more humane and attractive. Why is there still so much suffering all around? Why do some have so much and others so little? Why are most jobs mindless? Why can’t there be more security and leisure? Why do anxiety and fear persist almost everywhere? Aren’t we destroying the planet for no particular reason or reward? (By this time it may be getting very late, and only a stubborn few will continue to press on..) Couldn’t we start again in some new way, rejig things, perhaps pass some laws and experiment with bold new ideas in order to create a freer, less anxious, happier world?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, economic news doesn’t equip the population with the tools to understand their servitude. Less than 1% of the members of an advanced economy are in any position to grasp the economic system within which they live. There is widespread and deep ignorance about who owns what, how big money is made, what the relationship between capital, investment and rent is – and how the current system is legally underpinned. People are therefore left to feel a mixture of outrage and impotence. The news of the future would see it as one of its leading tasks to equip the population with the tools to make a better world economically, the world that currently only exists in about 5 highly favoured countries (Denmark, Switzerland, Norway…).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Politics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the aim of political news would be to help the nation to become a better version of itself. The news would ask: how can we get things to go better. The news wouldn’t just look to bring down the odd rotten politician or business person, it would concentrate on systemic problems holding the nation back: it would look to reduce financial anxiety and working hours. It would try to halt environmental degradation. It would investigate why people have to work so hard for so little. It would never lose sight of a truly radical agenda to make the nation as good as it can be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1483" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107347835.jpg" alt="A family passes by one of the stands pro" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>In its tone, Utopian news would be kindly and generous.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nastiness is currently deeply prestigious in the world of news. An interviewer who makes a politician look stupid and mean is on track to become a hero.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It started off with politicians. Now it’s spread to almost any target conceivable. We get a secret pleasure when new films are eviscerated by a reviewer. There’s a warm reception for scathing denunciations of sports stars. There’s a ready audience for anything that paints the Prime Minister or President as a shallow fool; we approve when the people running banks are dismissed as venal idiots, or celebrities as pampered, ageing and cheating airheads. Journalists around the world have made careers for themselves being nasty about everyone who comes under their remit. Entire sections of news outlets (<i>Private Eye</i>, <i>New York Observer</i> and <i>Gawker</i>) are given over to vicious, throwaway assessments of other humans.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we have a good time with ‘mean news’, we don’t think we are being pointlessly cruel. We just feel that we don’t have much power in the world, that there are lots of things wrong out there and that nastiness is the best, sharpest way to respond to sickness and evil. We’re being harsh, yes, – we think – but we’re calling time on illusion and nonsense. If we get furious and put the boot in, the world has a chance of becoming the better, kinder, saner place we’d like to see.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the prestige of nastiness rests on some deeply confused assumptions – which run counter to the best ideals of journalism. Yes, it is the task of journalism to be sceptical, to probe beneath the official story and to ask awkward questions in order to uncover the truth. But meanness has nothing to do with this sort of patient forensic scepticism towards complex situations. Meanness has already made up its mind, it knows the story before it even begins to assemble it: it is convinced (through prejudgement) that something or someone is awful, it has shut its ears to any other information, and just wants to kick the boot in with brio.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It sounds mad to argue that we should be nicer to the likes of Marie Le Pen or Murdoch. That’s because we’ve unfortunately confused being nice with a couple of things we rightly fear: being naive and being weak. Listening carefully to what someone says, trying to see the world through their eyes, this has nothing at all to do with agreement. If you start with a determined intent to humiliate someone, their opponents are delighted (because it confirms their prejudices) and yet you arrive at no insight into how to win the hearts and minds of the very many people who really do like what Murdoch or Le Pen have to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should think of being nice as an expression of confident strength; it’s a show of being secure enough to examine points of view that feel foreign to your own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need the news to be nice, not in the sense of reporting only on cuddly, sweet things. But in the sense of operating with a tone that is generous, curious and civil. Awful things won’t go away because we mock them. But if we understand them, see where they are coming from, and treat their advocates and supporters as fellow human beings, we have much more chance of dealing with them successfully – and therefore of making the world a better place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News from a while back</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What is news? A standard definition might go: ‘news’ is something that people don’t know about, that matters a lot – and that has happened just now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But consider another, subtly different way of defining the subject: ‘news’ is anything that people don’t know about, that matters a lot and that could have happened at any point in time, perhaps today, but equally, perhaps, some time in the fourth century B.C.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news holds a prestigious place in society because – as it likes to tell us in often bombastic tones – it can inform us about the most important things that have happened anywhere in the world in the past few hours. By its very nature, the news assumes that everyone has by now already heard all about what happened yesterday and the day before – and that everyone has by now already had all the interesting thoughts that it’s ever possible to have about the past, and that we hence never need to go over any of it again. The ‘news’ simply has to be about what happened since the last bulletin – or tweet.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of the time, this makes great sense. We don’t need to pour over the old stuff. We’re heading into the future, and at dizzying speed, and therefore we need the most up-to-date information, right now. But, sometimes, this philosophy robs us of a chance to get at key bits of information that didn’t gestate since breakfast time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes – and this is something the news will never tell us – the real ‘news’ happened a long time ago. It deserves to be called news because it’s still important, it’s still relevant and most crucially, it’s still new to most people alive now. There’s a lot of vital information out there that for various reasons hasn’t reached us yet. News organisations may boast about their high-tech satellites and fibre-optic cables, but the obstacles to delayed news are often cultural and psychological. Important information floats in the darker parts of the ether, but we’re distracted by other things, no one is bringing it up, we’re looking elsewhere. But the day we learn to tune in at last, it become news.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1488" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-The_Death_of_Socrates_cropped.jpg" alt="640px-The_Death_of_Socrates_cropped" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the early 400s B.C., the philosopher Socrates had a vital insight (a big bit of news) into what is needed for a good life. He argued that the first responsibility each person has towards themselves is to ‘know themselves.’ Every human needs to spend a good deal of their life getting to understand their motives, their prejudices, their ambitions and their frailties. We need to understand what we are really trying to do with our careers or why we so often get into in bitter rows with our partners or why every relationship we’ve been in fails or why we haven’t spoken to one of our cousins for six years, or why we get so anxious every Sunday evening. At the root of such mysteries is the fact that we don’t have full insight into our own motives and desires. Socrates’s momentous discovery is the amazing extent of our ignorance about ourselves. This discovery took place millennia ago, in a suburb of Athens. But it remains news, headline news, because the message has not yet been heard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Judged on the basis of importance, rather than sheer novelty, this piece of news from Athens deserves to go straight to the top of the agenda. It’s one of the enduring lead stories of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the wiser society, news would be thought of not just what happened in the last 24 hours, it could have happened at any time. The Utopian news organisation would understand that sometimes the real ‘news’ happened a long time ago. It deserves to be called news because it’s still important, it’s still relevant and most crucially, it’s still new to most people alive now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News would strive to be biased</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the news is to matter to us, it must be presented to us by organisations that have tried to think through the ends of human life, that have a vision of where we are trying to go as a species, and that have somewhere articulated their answers to their audiences. Enough of fence-sitting organisations that never dare to say what they really think.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, it seems that for years, the BBC has blatantly attempted to put out news without any bias attached to it. In a complex world, it’s simply decided to try to be ‘neutral’, hoping that this will constitute the best possible defence of important things. When reporting on contentious issues, the BBC has tried to be – unforgivably – constantly ‘fair’ and scrupulous about ‘the facts’.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1489" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156715861.jpg" alt="Pro-Palestinian Protesters Demonstrate Outside The BBC Headquarters" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p3">Yet the BBC’s bias against bias seems fundamentally mistaken. Facts can only become meaningful and relevant to us when they slot into some picture of what is important or trivial, right or wrong, hopeful or worrying, good or bad. News organisations that vaunt their neutrality forget that neutrality is simply impossible vis-à-vis the biggest questions facing our civilisation. There is no technocratic, risk-free, all-knowing sober set of answers to cling to. It’s a question of politics in the widest sense, and in the end, if you like, of philosophy.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue is not – therefore – the illusory one between bias and fact but between better and worse varieties of bias. We shouldn’t knock America’s <i>Fox News</i> or Britain’s <i>Daily Mail</i> just on the basis that they are biased, though we might argue that they seem badly biased.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1490" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/72105574.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY: US-media-Fox  Fla" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Think of the figures we most revere in history: Plato, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Sigmund Freud, the Buddha, Ghandi, Nelson Mandela… Each of them had a strong sense of what mattered and why, and their judgements were anything but perfectly balanced. They were just biased in fruitful ways.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We don’t need news stripped of bias, we need news presented to us with the best kinds of bias.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News organisations would employ comedians, artists and novelists</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information – assuming that if the information is significant, it will go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We merely get bored and turn away when they’re heaped in front of us. In order to matter to us, news has to become skilled at entering our imaginations: it has to accept the resounding truth that bare information isn’t sufficient. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1491" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/136536181.jpg" alt="Human Sculpture Created At Henley Beach" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sadly, many of the things that we should give our attention to are very easily ignored day to day, like the slow increment of stresses in the environment or the distant suffering of others. A crucial fact may become abstract and – to us – meaningless.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are creatures designed for intimate contact, for local lives and personal relationships. For ideas to become powerful in our souls, they need to be anchored in experience. We need to feel them, see them. This is what art, at its best, lasers in on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion: popularity and importance</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the most serious news would also be the most popular. We wouldn’t have the current fateful division between serious news (which no one takes in) and trivial news (which everyone is obsessed by).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, serious news would have learned a great deal from today’s tabloids. The aim would be to win popularity for what is important, useful, profound and good. It would be generous towards the ease with which we get distracted and the rapidity with which sympathy fades.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1492" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/82947407.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY SLIM ALLAGUI ---" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take the environment: the arctic ice is melting and this is going to have major, lasting implications for sea levels and weather around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few people care a lot but, strangely and shamefully, Taylor Swift’s legs are far more captivating. They are lovely in ways that seem to defy description: somehow they look ordinary, yet perfect. They are long, yet not freakish. They seem unbowed by their implausible length; both utterly firm and yet yielding and soft.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1510905821.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1510905821.jpg?resize=635%2C667" alt="BuzzFoto Celebrity Sightings In New York - August 31, 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who take global warming seriously tend to get apoplectic at this point. They’re not wrong. While delightful, Taylor Swift’s legs are of little significance in comparison with the fate of the planet. But getting angry at our fascination with the thighs of a singer is counter-productive in a democracy. We cannot be collectively dragged into being more responsible through guilt. And for a very simple reason. We don’t have to pay attention. If those who care about arctic melt are going to get angry, bitter and stern, they’ll just be ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, we really do need to do something about that ice. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are interested in Taylor Swift’s legs not because we are evil – but because we are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make important news not just ‘important’, but also beguiling – almost as tempting to hear about as Taylor’s legs. Then things stand a chance of changing.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/statueliberty-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4330" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/statueliberty-1.jpg?resize=635%2C514" alt="U.S. Navy Prepares For Columbus Day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For hundreds of years now, humans have tended to believe that the best sort of government is one which leaves its citizens maximally ‘free’. We’ve come to associate good government directly and uncomplicatedly with the promotion of ‘freedom’: freedom to worship as one pleases, to publish what one wants, to dress as one likes, to love whomever one desires. In the meantime, those who have opposed ‘freedom’ have been presented in horrifying terms: they have been the wicked priests, the murderous Communists and the demented Nazis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, this dichotomy (freedom = good/restriction = bad) has blinded us to a vital nuance with a grave potential to derail and corrupt public life: we’ve overlooked that there are better and worse kinds of freedom and that promoting freedom above all other values may be deeply unhelpful to the long-term and collective interests of the nation. Freedom is not a baseless word, but it is in general simply too vague, ambiguous and emotive a term to guide policy or to be an ideal around which a nation can reasonably cohere. It has grown too easy for corrupt and venal organisations to operate under the banner of ‘freedom’ in order to get away with activities that covertly run sharply counter to the public good. Freedom is evidently not a virtue when it involves the freedom of bankers to offload ruinous financial instruments on an uneducated public, just as censorship – that bogeyman of contemporary politics – is evidently far from a vice when it prevents corporations from pushing alcohol on children or denying affordable housing to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9921386226_c32cef9f59_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7836" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9921386226_c32cef9f59_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9921386226_c32cef9f59_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the word ‘freedom’ would therefore be used with far greater care than today – and would never come at the top of the list of what any government should aim for. The real aim of government should be the promotion of the public good and the flourishing of the greatest number – never simply the defence of the freedom of more or less anyone to do more or less anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the government would – with great intelligence and democratic accountability – often be interested in restricting freedom. Though we bridle at folk memories of police states, there is a more important and ambitious view of what government is for than merely freedom. Government is the institutionalisation of our long-term and collective interests. And the painful fact is that the pursuit of what matters to us in the long-term and collectively may at times be in sharp conflict with our short term and individual pleasures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3664751409_35774dc9ac_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6881" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3664751409_35774dc9ac_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3664751409_35774dc9ac_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s something parents understand very well about their children. They are forever having to say no – not because they are mean but because they know it’s their job to stand up for their child’s and their society’s longer-term needs. It’s because the parent keeps in mind (when the child can’t) that they will feel sick later, that they’ll be exhausted tomorrow, that they can’t simply cause chaos in the playground, that they step in. We have fully accepted this sort of case at the level of families. But we resist the thought that, as adults in society, we stand in equal need of having our own well-being protected against the worst wishes of others as well as against our own more unhelpful and destructive desires.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian society, there would be two areas in which government would be particularly vigilant. The first would be around freedom of production: defined as the freedom of anyone to use the earth’s resources (including its people) in any way for the generation of any degree of personal gain. Utopian government would in measured and skilful ways constantly step in to say ‘no’ to certain vested interests, without this in any way meaning that it was systematically anti-capitalist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8759446618_1a25ce283a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7834" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8759446618_1a25ce283a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="8759446618_1a25ce283a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One constraint which government would impose would be around what prices things could be sold at. Instead of being in favour of ever falling prices for consumer goods, government would promote the notion of a just price, a floor for prices reflecting the cost of humane and decent employment and production. Paternalistic utopian authorities would factor in what it costs to rear chickens properly and the need for farmers to make a reasonable profit – and it would then set a fair price for a dozen eggs. The Utopian government would stand against the idea that we must necessarily always seek to reduce prices. Instead its ambition would be to get us into the habit of paying the just price: a price that would allow high quality goods attuned to genuine needs to be put together by workers employed at an adequate wage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The government would also take an interest in censorship. The word terrifies us. In the history of censorship, it has generally seemed as if it is invariably something of real value – profound, earnest and true – that is being condemned and banned by someone who is corrupt and ideologically absurd. But in a wiser, more mature society, it would be accepted that the real threat is not always or necessarily that great truths are in danger of being repressed by malign authorities but rather that, sometimes, we are threatened by aggressive and uncontrolled commercial interests determined to quash our peace of mind and confuse us about our real needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1503" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2614890a.jpg" alt="Hayes Primary School, Croydon, United Kingdom. Architect: Hayhurst and Co., 2012." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Utopian government would be guided by a classical view of life in which citizens would be seen as needing help in learning how to live well. This would entail a responsibility not only over schools but also over media and the public realm more generally. Institutions such as a national broadcaster would be given a clear sense of purpose: their task would be the promotion of virtue. The move would be driven not by a merely mean-spirited desire to stop people doing what they wanted; it would be undertaken as a collective and voluntarily-induced act of self-parenting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When translated into politics, paternalism does not have to mean just bossiness and intolerance; it should properly mean that the state will have something in common with what is generally our best (and kindest) experience of having had someone look after our needs: having been someone’s child. The worry in the distant past was that what was most important to us would be undermined because we lacked basic liberties. But, on the whole, this is no longer where the problems of modern existence lie. We have won the battle for liberty. Now the enemies of our collective flourishing are more likely to lie in the troubles of unrestrained corporate and individual appetites and the unlimited pressure to generate immediate profit without regard for human and earthly costs. The government of the future would accept that it was not ultimately responsible just for freedom, but that its highest calling was to act as the guardian of long-term collective flourishing.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The system we know as Capitalism is both wondrously productive and hugely problematic. On the downside, capitalism promotes excessive inequality; it valorises immediate returns over long-term benefits; it addicts us to unnecessary products and it encourages excessive consumption of the world’s resources with potentially disastrous consequences – and that’s just a start. We are now deeply familiar with what can go wrong with Capitalism. But that is no reason to stop dreaming about some of the ways in which Capitalism could one day operate in a Utopian future:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we’d spend less time thinking about the Dow Jones.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Dow Jones, which is the world’s most prestigious financial index, takes a daily temperature reading of the US, assigning it a very precise number, which is widely reported in the news and which we tend to treat with a high degree of reverence. Such financial data seems to be telling us something of immense importance. It hints at an answer to the great questions of existence: are things going well or badly, is the world doing OK? How is life on earth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7821" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really worth asking such questions and reflecting heavily upon them. This is what philosophers traditionally like to do. But the numbers do not actually answer our questions, for the links between the Dow Jones figures and what is actually going on in human lives (their rise or fall) is far more elusive. It’s not that there is no connection whatsoever. The financial health of major US companies does have indirect, distant links to the economic side of everyone’s life. Yet the quality and character of daily life is powerfully affected by a great many things which the financial data does not recognise, for example, your health, the view from your window, the quality of your relationship, the amount of time you have to spend commuting, the connections you have with the neighbours, the state of your ambitions, your degree of envy, how your kids are doing. These may, indeed, be rather more important in determining ‘how things are going’ than the Dow Index. But the Dow doesn’t entirely admit this. It seems to be making a larger claim: to know how your life is going – and it brings to this claim a panoply of impressive arrows, charts and incomprehensible acronyms which cow us into believing in its authority, rather as our ancestors might have trusted in the confused mumblings of a priest sitting on top of an altar in a darkened temple.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all our expertise, we have not yet learned how to devise reliable indicators of the state of nations and individuals. We do not have a daily set of figures to record what truly matters. It might help, for example, to know the incidence of unnecessary embarrassment or whether arrogance is becoming 0.1% more or less common. We don’t have figures measuring supplies of patience, tact and forbearance. We don’t have indices around envy, infidelity and fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of these vital indicators, we cling to the signals offered to us by Wall Street. We use words like depression and exuberance, terms well known from personal life, to describe the movements of stocks and shares. To ask for better indices of national well being sounds whimsical. Yet it ought not to, for we need data that homes in on things that matter greatly for what our lives are actually like. Issues like jealousy, boredom, beauty, frustration or anger shape our destinies just as much – if not more – than the fortunes of 3M (the Minnesota Mining Company) and the twenty nine other corporations whose trading forms the basis for calculating the Dow Jones figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big issue is how we can get a diversity of indicators on our national dashboards. We are not suggesting the suppression of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. What we want to see is the rise of other – equally important – figures that report on a regular basis on elements of psychological and sociological life and which could form part of the consciousness of thoughtful and serious people. Today, a government cannot get rewarded, or chastised, for the impact its policies have on the frequency of domestic rows because rows are not recorded. When we measure things – and give the figures a regular public airing – we start the long process of collectively doing something about them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t just care about unemployment, we’d also worry about misemployment.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Employment means being, generically, in work. But misemployment means being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any real sincerity the true needs of other people: merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead. Like this fellow, dressing up as a hotdog to entice customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4335" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man employed by the casino chain Las Vegas Sands to hand out flyers to tourists so as to entice them to use slot machines is clearly ‘employed’ in the technical sense. He’s marked as being off the unemployment registers. He is receiving a wage in return for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of the human condition of interest to his employers: that not enough tourists might otherwise leave the blue skies and cheerful bustle of a south Nevada city’s main street to enter the dark air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed casino lined with ranks of ringing consoles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man is indeed employed, but in truth, he belongs to a large subsection of those in work we might term the ‘misemployed’. His labour is generating capital, but it is making no contribution to human welfare and flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and highly-sugared drinks (however delicious). The rate of misemployment in the economy is very high.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while we may be genuinely grateful for a job and give our best to do it well, at the back of our minds we do – as employees – nurture the hope that our work contributes in some real way to the common good; that we are making, modestly, a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just the most dramatically harmful kinds of work that register as misemployment. We intuitively recognise it when we think of work as ‘just a job’; when we sense that far too much of our time, effort and intelligence is spent on meetings that resolve little, on chivying people to sign up for products that – in our heart of hearts we don’t admire.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Economists and governments have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy has been the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment has been to ‘stimulate demand.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and misemployment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there are real solutions to bringing down the rate of misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se, the trick is to stimulate the right demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a nation properly concerned with misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. 20 per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another 30 per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul. People would be taught to respect good furniture, healthy food, wholesome clothes, fruitful holidays…</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7819" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the value of what is truly valuable and walk past what fails to address their true needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t to suggest that the employment figures are irrelevant – they matter a great deal. They are the first thing to be attended to. All the same the raw figures mask a more ambitious index – and a central question: are we deploying human capital admirably?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t just blame big evil corporations for everything.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems natural to point the finger of blame at many bad states of affairs at big corporations. But, in truth, there is an unexpected, and more important, cause of dispiriting jobs, garish signage, environmental abuse and troubling fast-food ingredients: our taste. Collectively, it is we, the consumers, who opt for certain kinds of ease and excitement over others. And once that basic fact is in place, everything else follows in the slipstream. It’s not companies that primarily degrade the world. It is our appetites, which they merely serve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1536" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/106449364.jpg" alt="A photo of a partially eaten McDonalds'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people who run fast food companies don’t, in their cunning hearts, think that their offerings are ideal, or that the job opportunities they provide are humane. They are not driven by a fixed desire to cook rubbish or create repetitive, stressful low-paid employment. They just want, very badly, to make a profit, but they’d make it anywhere if they could. If we wanted to buy wild salmon or pay a little extra for staff medical insurance, they’d let us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be deeply bothered by poor quality food, exploitative jobs and ugly environments; but in the hugely important task of unleashing a workable social and economic revolution, it matters a great deal where we point the finger of blame. The sobering news is that if all the managers and board members of certain objectionable conglomerates were sacked, similar pathologies of capitalism would spring up again at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t what these businesses are offering, since an offer can always be politely declined; it’s what we are choosing. The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd-sounding, but critical task: the education of the consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we’d work for companies we’d be proud to live and die for.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of living and dying for the sake of your work in a hospital or with the army seems utterly credible. The idea of living and dying for your accountancy firm or tanning salon sounds absurd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we don’t typically think of corporations as claiming or deserving any kind of special place in our deep selves. We tolerate the companies who provide the fabric of our incomes by selling phones and shoes, flights, groceries, insurance, trousers, electricity. One might be a bit better than another, offer attractive deals or provide decent service. But this is miles away from deep admiration or love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1538" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/170056241.jpg" alt="Views From The Google Shareholders Meeting As The Company's YouTube Triples Mobile Ad Sales" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to think that that’s exactly how things should be. It’s normal to think that if you’re keeping your wits about you, you should be a touch cynical about – and detached from – the corporate world. Companies sometimes like to talk in terms of love and big missions; but they never quite convince us when they do. It’s easy to satirise their efforts. The slogans are neat (‘We try harder’, ‘Just do it’, ‘I’m lovin’ it…’), but we’re all world-weary enough to shrug our shoulders and walk past with wry disregard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So right now, most corporations don’t deserve our deep admiration – and they don’t get it either. But at various times, we can catch glimpses of how it could be very different. In 1895, it wouldn’t have been at all strange for a station master to get married in his Great Western Railway uniform. Not because he was slavish. But because the ideals of the transport company – with its elegant locomotives, its impeccable service across miles of countryside, its commitment to ethical behaviour and responsible capitalism – resonated so deeply with his own better nature. The company’s devotion to service and reliability, the grandeur of its big stations, the sense of dignity in its pension schemes – these were things someone could take to heart and feel justifiably proud to be part of.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg" alt="PM-210214-coffinC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would it take for corporations to be worth a wedding suit or indeed our lives? They’d have to engage our better selves, do proper good in the world and help us to become who we want to be. Given how much of our lives we give to our work, these sound like highly necessary and not unrealistic ambitions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t loathe the rich or try to tax them more; we’d give them honour and status.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do the rich keep on working? Why do they enter stressful negotiations, constantly take on large risks, battle ambitious, hard-hearted rivals, and scheme and plot until the day they collapse? What are they doing it for? Why aren’t they satisfied with the extensive assets and large piles of money they already have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1540" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/billgates.jpg" alt="GHANA-US-AID-HEALTH-PEOPLE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surveying the problems of Capitalism, the standard response of the left has been to suggest that one simply tax the rich more. But this fails to grasp, and therefore properly to exploit, the real psychological motives of the rich. The rich only pursue money fanatically (to our great collective cost) because wealth appears to be the primary, most objective source of honour in the modern world. If only we can fix how honour is obtained, we will be able to redirect their mania to more socially beneficial ends in ways that don’t demand that the rich become ‘nice’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, a natural inclination is to force the rich to give up their wealth using the instrument of new taxes, but this strategy simply won’t work. The chances of people running away and taking their assets with them is too great. We know that entrepreneurial energy and competitive drive can too easily be depleted; the economic balloon can deflate and all will suffer. We need to go down a different route. We need to harness the talents and drives that the rich are currently using to squeeze the earth and its people too hard – and ensure that these energies are made to address  the collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim should be to seduce the rich – to make them want to benefit their societies in return for giving them what (we know) they deep down really want but haven’t until now reliably been able to get except through money: namely, honour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1541" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-19331466.jpg" alt="Obama Medal of Honor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough that societies can motivate people very powerfully through honour: soldiers will perform extraordinary feats on the battlefield in return for the highest gratitude from their countries (they don’t even ask to be paid very much – paid to die…). Scientists will labour in poverty for decades in the hope of winning a Nobel Prize. Yet as societies, we are only just beginning to explore what good can come out of vanity in the realm of business. In the commercial world, there are at present no systematic, fail-safe methods for gaining status in return for doing what society desperately needs capitalists to do: treat their workers well and produce useful, safe, environmentally-sound goods and services. In some countries, there may be the odd hope of a medal from the president or the queen if one behaves well, but the chances of securing one are simply too remote and unpredictable to motivate hard-headed capitalists in their actions from day to day: it remains far more rational to peg one’s hopes for status on the verifiable criterion of money than on the vague chance of an invitation from the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is precisely what needs to be changed – and urgently. Society should do a systematic deal with capitalists: it should give them the honour and love they so badly crave in exchange for treating their workers as human beings, not abusing customers and properly looking after the planet. A standard test should be drawn up to measure the societal good generated by companies (many such schemes already exist in nascent form), on the basis of which capitalists should then be given extraordinarily prestigious titles by their nations in ceremonies with the grandeur and thrill of film premieres or sporting finales. It might be something to go after their names (for example, RC: Responsible Capitalist), a title that would have some of the same associations as the Nobel Prize, the Victoria Cross and the Pulitzer prize – in other words, a fitting target for the most ambitious and narcissistically craven and damaged people in society to strive for.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The founding figure of modern economics, Adam Smith, adroitly recognised the two chief motivating factors in human life: the love of riches and the love of glory. He knew that these two things are what people ultimately want and what they work hardest for.  A wise society must therefore learn how to harness the love of glory at times, like now, when the public good comes into conflict with the love of riches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1543" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/83499093-635x423.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Effects of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>In the Utopia, businesses wouldn’t just satisfy our bodies, they’d take care of our souls.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generous, thoughtful, sensitive people are often drawn to the view that we shouldn’t expect economies to ‘grow’. After all, the earth and its resources are limited, so why keep asking for GDP to expand? We don’t need more commercial activity or more businesses. We are destroying the planet fast enough as it is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the environmental story, Capitalism pillages the planet for the sake of producing vast quantities of material possessions, many of which we do not really need and only crave because we are duped by relentless advertising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The implication is that we need to wind back consumerism in order to improve society and lead better lives. It’s understandable if this opinion is widespread. But perhaps the good future depends not on minimising Capitalism but on radically extending it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1546" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scarlett-Johansson.jpg" alt="Scarlett-Johansson" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, Capitalism should address the full range of needs of mankind as efficiently and effectively as possible. This is not currently happening: despite all the factories, the concrete, the highways and the logistics chains, the economy is as yet far too small and desperately undeveloped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations, Capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs, for sanitation, shelter, food supply and health care. The largest and most successful corporations have been those that satisfied appetites that we would categorise as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs: oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, insurance and banking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1547" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" />The briefest glance at the pyramid reveals a fascinating possibility: that the future growth of business will lie in an assault on a vast array of needs further up the pyramid, in the areas of love and belonging, esteem and self-actualisation. Capitalists and companies are seemingly – semi-consciously – aware of this issue. The evidence lies in advertising. Advertising almost always tries to sell us stuff with an appeal to our higher needs, by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfilment, authenticity, good relationships and a sense of true achievement.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, as yet, the corporations who pay for the adverts are not actually devoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked. We get promised friendship or love and end up with a 4×4 or a new barbecue set. Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy; it already trades on all the right fantasies. It’s just that there are as yet very few of the truly right products and services out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, only in the last five minutes of our history have we realised that there are very big business opportunities to be found in friendship. And yet Facebook is still making only a rudimentary contribution to the ideal development of this activity. Similarly, only very recently has there been commercial exploration of the fact that we need to keep secrets, yet feel very drawn to raw, dramatic confession as well. A new app which helps us in this area – <a href="https://www.secret.ly"><span class="s2">https://www.secret.ly</span></a>/ – is now a very successful business enterprise in Silicon Valley, worth tens of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An organised response to our higher needs is not novel. Religions used to address them. Catholicism, if seen as a business, would be the second largest corporation in the world, bigger than Ford or BP or Samsung. Art galleries and museums shared some of the character of religions and similarly tried to address our higher needs, although their clients tended to be governments and nations rather than individual customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1548" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-18605229-1-1.jpg" alt="Vatican Pope Epiphany" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call ‘a business idea’ is at heart just an as yet unexplored need. To trace the future shape of Capitalism, we only have to think of all the needs we have that are, currently, poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no shortage: we need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities. We need help in bringing up children. We need help in calming down at key moments (the cost of our high anxiety and rage is appalling in aggregate). We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace and understanding where we can best deploy them (a service in this area would matter a great deal more to us than pizza delivery). We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires. Elegant town centres, charming high streets and sweet villages are in desperately short supply and are therefore absurdly expensive – just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed but were very rare and only for the very rich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These higher needs are not trivial or minor wants, little things we could easily survive without. They are, in many ways, absolutely central to our lives. We have simply accepted, without really thinking about it, that there is nothing we can do to address them. And yet to be able to structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t know, today, quite what the businesses of the future will look like. Just as in 1975, no one could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google. But we know the direction we need to head to: we need the drive and inventiveness of Capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life. This will offer an exit from the failings and misery that attend Capitalism today. In a nutshell, the problem is that we waste resources on unimportant things. And we are wasteful, ultimately, because we lack self-knowledge, because we are using consumption merely to divert or quieten anxieties or in a vain search for status and belonging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we could just address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained, our work would be more meaningful and our profits would be more honourable. That’s the ideal future of Capitalism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Conclusion</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the moment we tend to think that the definitive goal of business is to turn a profit. We assess the success of companies really only in financial terms: the more profitable they are, the better the business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, businesses would of course have to be profitable. But the success of a business would primarily be assessed in terms of its contribution to the collective good. The aim would not be to maximise profits, but to maximise the amount of good that could be done, while still being profitable. In the Utopia it would be understood that the proper end of business is the good.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Serious people are used to thinking badly of ‘celebrity culture’. This is deeply irresponsible. The impulse to admire and have heroes is an important part of human nature. Ignoring or condemning it won’t kill it off; it simply forces it underground, where it lurks undeveloped, prone to latch on to inappropriate targets.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050314-celebsB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4254" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050314-celebsB.jpg?resize=635%2C539" alt="Halloween Party, Brentwood, Los Angeles, America - 26 Oct 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Human beings need role models. We therefore shouldn’t complain about or eradicate ‘celebrity culture.’ We need to improve it, bringing a better kind of person to the fore of public consciousness: we need better celebrities rather than no celebrities. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Alexander Lukashenko is an old-fashioned dictator of Belarus. He is often described as the last dictator in Europe. This doesn’t mean that he doesn’t care &#8211; in a way &#8211; about making his country a better place. Recently, he has run a nationwide competition to find a new raft of celebrities.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusA.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Elena is very good at milking cows. On her best ever day, she pumped over 1,100 litres from the herd into the tanks. And recently her prowess has been recognised by the government of Belarus. She has been named officially the &#8216;Best Milkmaid of the Slutsk region&#8217;, which lies just south of the capital Minsk. It&#8217;s like winning a major talent competition on TV in the West. Elena travelled to the capital to pick up an award from the President himself. She&#8217;s been in all the papers.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusB.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Sasha, too, has been honoured. He held the 2015 title of ‘Best Welder of the Republic’.</p>
<p>All countries, of course, stage competitions. We regularly award prizes for excellence at the long jump or in throwing darts at a board. These things are recreational, though, rather than focused on jobs or the ordinary activities of everyday life. In Belarus, the ambition is quite different. Elena and Sasha are national celebrities, the equivalent of hosts of television chat shows, supermodels and tycoons in other lands. They are seen as embodying ideals to which all should aspire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, young couples are encouraged to revere the example set by two other prize winners: Natalya and Konan, who have been awarded the prize for Belarus’s ‘Best Couple in Love’.</p>
<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusC.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The public are requested to pay attention to how well they listen to each other, to admire their mutual trust and respect and to be touched (and inspired) by the delight they take in one another’s company.</p>
<p>And, to come to another prize, prospective parents will be invited to look up to Olga, winner of ‘The Best Mother of a Large family of the Smorgon region’.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusD.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The awards handed out in Belarus are not ashamed to stress the virtues of very ordinary people. The winners become famous, but don’t at all look the way we have come to think that famous people should. Most people in the UK or Germany don’t look sufficiently smart or fashionable to be able to become famous. But Belarus has focused entirely on how good a person is at doing something basic and useful – like bringing up a family, working in a dairy or helping make tractors. These are the country’s only criteria of fame.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusE.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is very unfortunate if we associate these kinds of awards – which bestow celebrity status for excellence in ordinary things – just with oppressive regimes.</p>
<p>In fact, the good idea behind such awards is universal. It belongs as much – in fact, more so – in liberal states.</p>
<p>The core point is that a lot of things we should care about, and need to take seriously, are not currently well treated by the media machine that creates &#8216;celebrity culture&#8217;. But that&#8217;s no reason to despair of the idea of celebrity. We should take more seriously the task of creating &#8216;good celebrities&#8217;, good in the sense that one would be honouring people who demonstrate with particular clarity virtues that need to be more prominent in society. As part of this new venture to create <strong>Better Celebrities</strong>, one might &#8211; for example &#8211; set up prizes for:</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The introvert who most successfully managed to communicate what he/she felt to their partner&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The child who most generously forgave their parents&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The worker who most intelligently defused infighting at the office&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>And, the biggest prize of all: <strong>‘The Husband who best Learned to Control his Temper and Say Sorry.’</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The UK government, like so many around the world, is desperate to crack down on tax evasion. Too much money is being squirrelled away in tax havens like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands and the government desperately needs the cash. Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: “The days of hiding money in another country to cheat the UK are coming to an end.”</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2159" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxA.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How then does the government propose to stop people evading taxes? By frightening them – with the help of a new multi-million pound advertising campaign. Posters will go up around the country from next week showing a pair of eyes staring at you through a gash in what is presumably meant to be your special reinforced bank locker. A caption announces: ‘We’re closing in on undeclared income,’ while in smaller type below, comes a message with a yet scarier intent: ‘If you’ve declared all your income you have nothing to fear.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2160" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxB.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re coming to get you</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to understand what led the government to this campaign. They are in deep trouble and want to do something about the missing billions fast and so fell for the most obvious tactic: trying to frighten people into paying up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it’s a very unhelpful move. In so doing, they are only reinforcing the very problem that causes tax evasion in the first place: the sense that paying tax is a highly unpleasant thing to do, forced upon the population by bossy, authoritarian governments, who will waste your precious money in bureaucratic nonsense and grandstanding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re missing a trick: instead of scaring people into paying tax, governments should seduce them into doing so – just like every successful charity in the world. They should show us, the citizenry, why our money could be so very helpful to the nation, how kind we would be to hand it over and how grateful the nation would be if we did so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2161" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxC.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Thank you for helping us to buy this</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paying tax is the single most generous act we ever perform in relation to our fellow human beings. It’s via taxation that we acknowledge our debt to others and reinforce our common humanity. Yet how little joy this (forced) gift brings us! Whatever libertarians may claim, some of our money does truly go towards unambiguously good things: primary schools, mental health facilities, fire engines, the frail, the sick and that ambulance that just raced past you on its way to help an arthritic 83 year old who tripped on the stairs ten minutes ago.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet rather than evoking the benefits of tax, governments always frame payment in the most forbidding and hateful terms, as though they themselves didn’t quite trust in the justice of what they were getting us to do. They act with suspicion and aggression from the first. No one ever explains what good the tax money might do or bothers to say so much as a tiny thank you when the money does come in. It’s about the most unfulfilling huge donation one ever makes. No wonder people try everything to avoid paying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxD.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Oasis Academy Hadley</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">And so kind of you to chip in for this too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Governments should adopt a very different policy. Rather than resorting to fear, they should use charm. They should rehearse the sound arguments that exist as to why paying tax is a deeply noble act, the essence of transcending the ego. Rather than shaming the avoiders, it should melt their hearts. It should set up prizes for those who pay the most tax, rewarding them with honours, respect and love. It should reconnect us emotionally with the benefits of our contribution to the common good. It should show off the new ambulances and the freshly painted schools. And it should say thank you all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We would then end up feeling a lot better about what we had to pay for – and the nation would have to spend a lot less time and money terrifying its people into supporting their own communal needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2163" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxE.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not a very helpful line either</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="post-1113" class="post-1113 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized">
<p class="entry-title"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things seem to be going really well with the institution of the art museum. All the big cities have one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, new ones are popping up constantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the lines to get into blockbuster shows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can snake around the block</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the buzz, museums are arguably not doing as much for us as they might; their whole purpose and function in modern society has been left oddly rather unexplored. Many of us show up at these museums more out of guilt than genuine pleasure. The prestige of art &#8211; as opposed to any spontaneous enthusiasm &#8211; is what seems to keep a sizeable share of people coming through the doors. And a lot of the more recent art on display can be deeply puzzling to behold &#8211; even if we don’t generally reveal our confusion for fear of seeming foolish. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9010" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the problem of the art museum is an institutional inability to define in simple terms what art might actually be for and quite why it should matter so much. We may be heartily convinced of art’s importance, but we have a devilishly hard time pinning the significance down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a suggestion: the purpose of art is therapeutic. It is there to lend inspiration and consolation in relation to a number of the challenges of being human. Art helps us to cope with, among other things:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inability to focus on what is beautiful and precious in life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our tendency to caricature others and forget about their sufferings </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inclination to lose hold of our inherent creativity and playfulness </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our frustrated longings to create better societies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and our need for stillness, perspective and solemnity in an angry chaotic world</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9011" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time.jpg?resize=453%2C604" alt="Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it may be fashionable to say otherwise, art is definitely not there just ‘for art’s sake.’ It is a tool to help us to live and die well; it opens our eyes, it returns us to a sense of creativity, it connects us with strangers, it shakes us from political complacency, it stills our agitated hearts. Art has a healing function.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives us all we need to define what an art museum should be:</span></p>
<p><b>An institution that displays and arranges art in ways that can best heal its audiences.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a stark and deliberately vulgar definition would have revolutionary implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, most art museums are laid out chronologically </span>as if the most important thing about works of art was when they were made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with a better focus on the function of art, works could now be rearranged according to the distinctive troubles of the soul they could help us with.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4468203053_45b75c4385_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9013" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4468203053_45b75c4385_b.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="4468203053_45b75c4385_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be a gallery devoted to addressing The Agonies of Love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another focused on helping us cope with Anxiety; a third devoted to issues of Envy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fourth to Aging and so on&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Entire museums might bite off one part of a therapeutic emotional curriculum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be a Museum for Calm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that would collect a range of works that helped to usher in this prized mood from across all centuries and media. There could be A Museum for Creativity; A Museum for Friendship &#8211; and so on. Some might be very big. Others quite small. They might exist online or in a narrow space between a pub and a kebab shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10871847465_207c925b47_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9012" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10871847465_207c925b47_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="10871847465_207c925b47_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You often hear it said that ‘museums of art are our new cathedrals’: in other words, that art can heal us as religions once did. It’s an intriguing and vital idea which art museums haven’t in fact taken up, because while they expose us to objects of genuine importance, they seem unable to curate them in ways that link them powerfully to our inner needs. Our new cathedrals are underperforming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should give up on the idea of the art museum as some kind of dead storage space for the history of the subject or a whitewashed cavern that stays intimidatingly silent as to its purpose. The art museum deserves to be reborn as a kind of superior chemist or drugstore, that vividly signposts art and culture and uses it to bring inspiration, solace and meaning to our confused, anxious and troubled societies.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you asked an average customer-oriented bank what they were in the business of doing, they&#8217;d look at you rather strangely, as if you were asking them something so obvious, you might be taking them for fools. Evidently, banks exist to keep money safe, to make it grow and to deliver it swiftly to their customers when they need it.</p>
<p>In highly competitive times, banks will do their hardest to demonstrate prowess in these three areas. They will let the world know that they are a safe haven, that they are extremely adept at making portfolios grow and that they respond with unparalleled rapidity to customer demands. Some are even open 24 hours a day. One could, in a generous moment, even feel rather sorry for banks given the sweat they must expend competing in these areas. It is extremely hard to grow a portfolio more than 4.5% per annum, never more so than when markets are relentlessly saggy or volatile.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6055376303_19f39774b3_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9512" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6055376303_19f39774b3_b.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6055376303_19f39774b3_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only when we insist on the original question that the founding assumptions behind modern banking reveal some of their strangeness. What really do we want from banks? And then the real enquiry: what do we want from money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably not clever to be overly sophisticated here, at least not initially: we simply want to be happy. We want money not to cause us anxiety and to be responsible for increasing our sense of well-being. But this is where the issues start, for happiness around money is no simple matter. The modern assumption is rather immodest and blatant: we insist that all we need to be happy with money is to have more and more of it. This represents the sum total of the complexity we (or rather, classical economics) generally allow into the topic.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5559517904_825589a166_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9517" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5559517904_825589a166_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="5559517904_825589a166_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even banks filled with people with advanced qualifications and armies of computers tend not to question these assumptions very much. There may be immense intelligence within banks but it is solely directed towards the big bold agenda: making money grow. But the subject of money and happiness is &#8211; evidently &#8211; just a little more complicated than this orientation would assume. To reach happiness around money is to embark on a journey full of unexpected currents and hidden whirlpools. We can quickly summon up just a few of the complexities:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- How happy our money makes us isn’t just a question of the amount we have; it partly depends on how we have made it. The more pleasurable the process of accumulation, the less substantial the overall sum might need to be (and vice versa).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9520" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We want to earn money to provide money for our families, on the assumption that money is what they need but providing them with more than a certain amount seems to have odd side-effects. Giving people we love too much money can land them up in clinics.</span></p>
<p>&#8211; It’s nice to give money away and goodness knows people need help: but where &#8211; really &#8211; does money make a difference? And what causes feel close to our own hearts?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9522" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- How much money we feel we need is a decision highly dependent on what others in the immediate vicinity &#8211; our reference points &#8211; are making. Feeling comfortably-off relies on measuring ourselves against targets which lie outside our control and upon which we generally reflect very little. There are perhaps two ways to feel richer: to make more money &#8211; or to change our friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It’s hard to know what to spend money on in order to be genuinely satisfied. We’re provided with constant temptations and encouragements to invest in this or that: but which of these really work for us? We have to understand ourselves quite well to know how to spend. Shopping is an oddly serious matter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/262222699_d7234420b4_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9526" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/262222699_d7234420b4_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="262222699_d7234420b4_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Anxiety is a constant: we worry about everything. A lot of this anxiety gets channelled, of course, towards money. If only we reach a certain goal, then &#8211; at last &#8211; we will be stable and secure. But how skilled is money at answering the hopes we have placed in it? We are exhausting ourselves in search of money: how accurate are we being in our hopes for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank of the future will certainly keep money safe &#8211; and do its best to make it grow. But it will also understand that really its job is to open up pathways to contentment around money and that this depends on far more than a 4.5% annual increase in portfolios. It will therefore seek to act as a forum in which customers can learn what role money plays in their lives and what their options might really be. The idea of a bank stands ready to be re-invented, no longer as an institution that just has a secure safe-deposit box and a commitment to fruitful investment, but also one that tackles the underlying issues which banking straddles, the profound questions of how we can live well around money, however much or little we may have. The ambitious banks of the future will be experts in finance, of course, but they will also know a lot about something equally critical but as yet too often ignored by the financial world: the psychology of money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are, apparently, in a golden age of the communications industry. This is a sector that has grown in double digits for over 20 years. Almost the entire world is now wired and connected; we can stand on a remote clifftop and effortlessly send our thoughts to distant continents via devices smaller than a pack of cards.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phones equipped with the capacities of yesterday’s supercomputers &#8211; yet able to fit into our pockets &#8211;  show miraculous improvements on a six monthly basis.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2923225445_7b265a69b0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9340" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2923225445_7b265a69b0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2923225445_7b265a69b0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications companies can rightly point out, as they often do in their advertisements, that they have helped us to communicate better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are two ways to understand what communication actually is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- defined technically, good communication means the capacity to effectively and near instantaneously relay data or voice signals from one person to another</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- psychologically, good communication means the ability to make oneself heard and understood by others about the things that really matter, especially the tricky, awkward things</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9345" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure good technical communication, you need the best routers, servers, fibre optic cables, wifis and satellites.</span></p>
<p>And to be a good communicator at a psychological level, you need to be equipped with the very best kind of emotional education:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an ability to understand what you yourself think and feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a confidence that you will be able to make yourself heard by others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a capacity to be patient and non-aggressive in relaying messages</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a skill at evading the defence mechanisms of your listener</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an open-mindedness in hearing ideas that could sound foreign or threatening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and finally, a culture that lends legitimacy to the idea of people talking frankly to one another about the most vital things.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6029951734_f8ceba1124_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9349" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6029951734_f8ceba1124_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Phone Call on a Balcony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite our extraordinary prowess at the technical side of communication, we humans have &#8211; arguably &#8211; made very little progress towards improving the quality of psychological communication between ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still too often get into sulks and furies, we don’t say what is on our minds or fail to get our points across. Despite all the masts and satellites, there are still too many sons not quite saying what they feel to their mothers and wives not listening to their husbands and colleagues not finding the right words. There are still too many suicide notes and death-bed scenes where the majority is left unsaid.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4556917408_e39510967c_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9351" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4556917408_e39510967c_b.jpg?resize=550%2C645" alt="4556917408_e39510967c_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So much of what we want to say remains locked up inside us, or travels between humans as unreliably as the pigeon post of 200 years ago.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time for us to reach a broader understanding of what a Communication Company really could be: not just an organisation that ensures that people communicate technically, but also one that helps to facilitate a good psychological dialogue between them; a company that helps give them the emotional equipment to ensure that the important conversations can happen. </span></p>
<p>We can feel deeply grateful to the folks who brought us our phones; we’ll feel even more grateful to the companies of the future that will properly honour the highest ideals of human communication.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The competition among resort hotels is fierce and, in order to secure our loyalty, establishments have to show us that they are trying hard in a range of areas. They therefore strive to demonstrate that they will:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- do everything to make sure we will sleep well</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- help us reconnect with our families</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- provide a forum in which we can rekindle romantic feelings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- give us a sense of well-being</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9501" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It is worth paying close attention to how our hotels go about achieving these four properly important aims &#8211; because of the light it casts on our societies in general; this is about a lot more than just hotels. We live in highly material times. This is often understood to mean that we love money as opposed to ‘higher things’; that we are, in other words, materialistic. But such a definition threatens to throw the emphasis on greed, whereas the real issue is broader and more intriguing. It is rather the case that we overwhelmingly treat human beings as creatures whose only pleasures &#8211; and sorrows &#8211; are those that occur in the body. The lion’s share of the economy is devoted to satisfying physical, as opposed to psychological needs. We see this issue in its most acute form in the arena of modern medicine, which &#8211; with its dazzling technologies &#8211; insists on seeing the human animal as a machine made up of interconnected organs and pays scant attention to what used to be called the soul.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An identical approach is present, in a more covert form, in the realm of hotels. Here too the idea of pleasure is interpreted solely as if it were a bodily experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious hotels of today implicitly ask themselves a variety of questions about happiness and answer them in ways we should find distinctive:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why can&#8217;t people sleep?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the bed is not springy enough, the quilt is not made with duck feathers and the cotton in the sheets is not from the Nile Delta.</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16382517424_de3c99d2eb_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9508" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16382517424_de3c99d2eb_k.jpg?resize=550%2C634" alt="16382517424_de3c99d2eb_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why do families disconnect emotionally?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is no water slide, no pool with a wave machine and no waterskiing instructor.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why has romance died?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Because there is no restaurant overlooking the bay and no French cuisine with a northern Italian twist.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why are people not feeling well?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because their feet have not been rubbed sufficiently thoroughly and no one has yet poured jasmine oil on their backs.</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8717591430_fee1cd577a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9507" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8717591430_fee1cd577a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8717591430_fee1cd577a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern resort hotel is a machine for happiness that overwhelmingly insists that the roots of unhappiness reside at the physical level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some undoubtedly do (one should not quibble with the pleasures of a water slide) but a great many of the more stubborn obstacles to contentment appear to be firmly rooted in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive marketplace, an important future resides with hotels that can remember just how many difficulties exist outside of our bodies. These ingenious establishments will, alongside the fine restaurants and sheets, also have the imagination to provide hospitality and care for our turbulent and skittish minds.</span></p>
