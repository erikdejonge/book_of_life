				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business is focused on addressing a multitude of human needs; for everything from Jelly Babies to cardiac surgery to nuclear technology to hand soap dispensers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because human needs are so wide ranging, and span such a multitude of different appetites and desires, it can be useful to divide these needs into three broad categories &#8211; and then even arrange them up a distinctive sort of ladder:</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9854" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C618" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way of cutting up our needs signals the different parts of the mind and body that a given business may be appealing to &#8211; and allows one to segment organisations in the commercial landscape according to what needs they service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ladder also lets us observe how the needs that businesses tackle have changed over time. From the dawn of humanity until around 1750 in Western Europe, the servicing of </span><b>Core Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> constituted the dominant share of all business activity. The limited technological resources of societies meant that the end of work was &#8211; by and large &#8211; just about keeping people alive in a very minimal sense: survival was the priority of business.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9857" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="640px-Philibert-Louis_Debucourt_-_Promenade_de_la_galerie_du_Palais-Royal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from 1750 onwards, we see businesses starting to address the next stage up the ladder. On an ever increasing scale, they began to focus on what we are calling </span><b>Comfort Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: this is the age when, for the first time in Britain, department stores opened and offered customers a range of linens, fashionable clothes and furnishings. Newspapers began to be read on a wide scale; there was a growth in publishing &#8211; and an expansion in inns and coffee houses. Commerce became angled towards the satisfaction of the tastes of a growing middle class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That leaves the final and most ambitious category: </span><b>Flourishing Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is only very recently that these have appeared on the commercial horizon. The needs have of course been around since pre-history, but they hadn’t until very recently been thought of as something that commerce could get involved with, commodify, sell and draw profit from. It was left up to other forces &#8211; religion and the arts predominantly &#8211; to cater for them, either outside of the mainstream economy or on a very artisanal, sporadic basis. Then, in the 1960s, beginning in Madison Avenue in New York, advertising began to recognise and think of these needs. The advertising industry didn’t quite deliver on the needs, but it knew what they were, for it appealed to them with systematic rigour when selling </span><b>Comfort</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Core Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is in this era that it began to be typical to sell cars with allusions to love &#8211; and to encourage people to buy drinks with subtle references to a sense of sexiness and belonging.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/517232932_9a294cb6bc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9859" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/517232932_9a294cb6bc_z.jpg?resize=485%2C640" alt="517232932_9a294cb6bc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big prediction for the coming century is that enormous opportunities will open up for businesses that can skilfully address our </span><b>Flourishing</b> <b>Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Technology, the wealth of nations and the shift in public taste will make this very likely. A great many of the multi-billion dollar companies of the future will be those focused on the fulfilment of flourishing needs: our need for self-knowledge around love, our desire for a satisfying social life, or our need for resilience. Bits of the tech sector are already nibbling at the borderline between Comfort and Flourishing needs, a trend aided by the forthcoming development of Artificial Emotional Intelligence. This, rather than the economies of developing nations, are what constitute the truly ‘emerging markets’ of the future.</span></p>
<p><b>Core </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>Comfort Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will, of course, continue to play a huge role in the economy; but for the first time in history, it is </span><b>Flourishing Needs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will begin to provide major opportunities for the organisational genius, commodifying power and muscle of business. Some of the most profitable businesses of the future will be those that understand the trickier, more elusive needs of our hearts and souls that have hitherto eluded the grasp of commerce. We will be the richer for it, in every sense.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are always making consumption decisions: where to go on holiday; which handbag to purchase; which mortgage lender to go to; what style of socks or make of car to buy; what to have for lunch. We don’t normally spell it out, but each decision is a shot at understanding ourselves in some sector of existence, big or small.  The range of our options is inevitably constrained but ideally, in exercising choice, we are promoting our happiness to the greatest possible extent. Even apparently modest things like what we put in the trolley in the supermarket or what shoes we wear are distillations of large, nebulous notions: who we think we are, how we wish to live and what we think will contribute to our well being. From different directions, all our actions as consumers are tapping into the same central question: what will make me happy?</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9972076934_d978c6784b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9749" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9972076934_d978c6784b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9972076934_d978c6784b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend to think of consumption going badly or well mainly around price. We get annoyed with ourselves for spending too much. Or we’re really pleased if we pick up a bargain.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another way things can go wrong around consumption choices. We choose the wrong things because we don’t know ourselves well enough to select what will best work for us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2546988230_cf30f21653_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9751" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2546988230_cf30f21653_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2546988230_cf30f21653_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can initially sound like a strange and rather insulting idea. How can you possible say that I am not qualified to know what I want? The idea that we might have a shortfall of self-knowledge around purchasing decisions can feel offensive.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pursuit of happiness through personal choice is a key notion of modern capitalism. And it is tied to a critical &#8211; but rarely admitted &#8211; assumption, which is that we already naturally have enough self knowledge and a good enough grasp of our true needs  to make the right choices for ourselves.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1879917264_2d11508922_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9755" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1879917264_2d11508922_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C394" alt="1879917264_2d11508922_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the problem is that self-knowledge isn’t as easy and obvious as we might naturally suppose. With hindsight, we can sometimes see we’ve made mistaken choices. One ends up thinking things like: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I thought I’d be wearing that dress all the time, in fact it’s hardly left the wardrobe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I seriously underestimated how stressed the mortgage would make me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I thought moving to the country would be great, but I just can’t stand being cut off from my old friends. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What am I doing in Croatia at the beach!</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regrets could be summed up as the thought: if I’d known myself better at the time I’d have made a different decision.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5848797681_a3d91236ff_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9760" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5848797681_a3d91236ff_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="5848797681_a3d91236ff_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s natural at times to blame ourselves for these mistakes. But really we’re more deserving of sympathy than criticism, because there are some pretty serious obstacles to the necessary consumer self-knowledge. Here are a few of these obstacles:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: We track prestige too much</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we think we want is produced culturally. We’re strongly inclined to take our cues from other people &#8211; and to take to heart whatever has prestige in our society. We see this &#8211; with comic clarity &#8211; in societies far from our own, especially those in the past. There were times and places where adolescent boys were desperately excited by the idea of possessing a walking stick.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/KUs3XVY.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9740" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/KUs3XVY.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="KUs3XVY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aged fourteen, they’d long for the day when they too could tap the pavement with an ebony cane. It seems funny in retrospect, but it is really just evidence about the power of prestige. We naturally want the things that convey social status &#8211; though, of course, what things have prestige changes dramatically over time. </span></p>
<p>Prestige is a problem when the things that enjoy prestige are not the ones that happen to serve our own best interests. We are so dependent on the regard of others, we may well forget the signals from deep within us that are hinting to us that we are not actually happy with the standard paths being proposed.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mw18391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9762" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/mw18391.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="NPG P869(7); Cyril Connolly by Cecil Beaton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"> © Cecil Beaton Studio Archive, Sotheby&#8217;s London</h6>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the late winter of 1961, the portly literary critic Cyril Connolly wrote an article in the Sunday Times about his recent holiday to Barbados. And in it he took a brave decision. He decided to tell the wider world about his passion for snorkelling. Since then (and partly thanks to him) it no longer seems very strange for a seriously minded middle aged individual to don a rubber mask and a special breathing tube and bob around looking at cuttlefish and unusual kinds of seaweed. But at the time it was a very unusual activity indeed. There must have been a great many serious people who in fact would have liked it, if they had given it a go. Connolly was distinctive in the degree to which he was aware of his own needs and pleasures and was prepared to accord them time and respect; his snorkelling activities were connected to self-knowledge. It’s a tiny instance of a huge issue. We don’t automatically know ourselves well enough to know what we’d like. And specifically we are put off by anything that seems potentially odd. We generally fail to trust ourselves over the habits of other people.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: We have difficulty registering self-data</span></i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally speaking, attention is selective. You might have walked past an old building many times; then someone mentions that the chimney is an usual shape. You must have seen this on countless occasions &#8211; in the sense that your eyes had flitted over the roofline &#8211; but not actually noted it. It’s a reminder of something slightly disconcerting about how our minds work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We often have fleeting sensations of pleasure or disappointment which we are marginally aware of, but don’t focus on. For instance: </span></p>
<p>– The indicator in a particular kind of car makes a strangely attractive clicking sound.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Some cutlery designs feel nicer to hold than others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The sleeves of a jacket are slightly too long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– It could be very nice just to eat a cheese sandwich at a restaurant.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4716630812_84b9931b09_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9766" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4716630812_84b9931b09_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="4716630812_84b9931b09_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may have these sensations in a subliminal way, but don’t pay much attention to them. Later someone else might point what the lovely or annoying thing was that was going on. And with their help we learn to see more clearly what we want or don’t want. We get to know ourselves a little better in some part of existence. In principle, this is something we can do for ourselves. We don’t have to wait on the chance fact of another person guiding our attention more carefully. But we generally fail to act on our spontaneous feelings.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three: We underrate the long-term</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present instant looms extremely large in consciousness. But our choices will have lasting repercussions. In theory, we know this perfectly well. Yet, with shocking regularity, we make decisions based on the mood of the moment, which turns out to misrepresent our better long-term interests.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not so surprising we have this tendency. The human mind developed to tackle short-horizon problems. In a more precarious world than we inhabit now, this makes perfect sense. For hundreds of thousands of years the primary issue was to make sure you could survive the next 24 hours. That’s the mentality we’ve largely inherited. The long-range, strategic mind is less closely connected to our appetites and emotions.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four: Our habits are responses to earlier problems </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At critical moments of development we take up attitudes which enable us to cope with certain problems.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14274244062_0a750d958e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9768" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14274244062_0a750d958e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C582" alt="14274244062_0a750d958e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s father may have been stymied in his career and so any conspicuous success would look like a criticism of him. It seemed at that time necessary to disdain any expensive item. So later on, one feels compelled to order the least expensive dish in a restaurant or wear only very modest clothes, even though there’s a part of oneself that might relish </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">homard american</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or an elegant winter coat. But because of the pressure of the past, these areas of self-knowledge don’t get explored. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having in the past suffered from not being able to afford things, one might develop a compensatory strategy of insisting always on luxury. It’s an attempt to fix an early humiliation. It can easily continue to override a more accurate assessment of one’s needs. One is still warding off a worry of ten years ago rather than carefully sifting one’s current needs.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8191196707_381c2962d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9770" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8191196707_381c2962d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="8191196707_381c2962d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">**</span></p>
<p>These four big factors make it tricky for the mind to know itself. It’s very unfortunate, but not surprising, that it can take so long to sift through them and slowly arrive at self-knowledge. There is information inside our minds that the conscious self doesn’t have easy access to, though this information is central to the project of finding out what we want.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If perfect self-knowledge markets existed, it would be possible to readily generate satisfaction. Unfortunately, we are very far from possessing anything like perfect self-knowledge. Our predictable failures of self-knowledge have large and very unfortunate consequences for the economy.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand is geared towards things that don’t produce happiness</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When people don’t understand themselves very well (by understand, we mean, don’t understand the path to <em>eudaimonia</em>), then what happens is: we misunderstand our own needs and make purchase that are misguided: that is, that fail to lead to what we ourselves are aiming at &#8211; our own happiness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5243300641_67748723d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9776" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5243300641_67748723d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5243300641_67748723d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work is low in meaning</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because meaningful work can be defined as work that properly enhances the wellbeing of others, if we sense that others don’t actually need what we’re involved in producing and perhaps would &#8211; if their self-knowledge were greater &#8211; actually reject it, we are left with a nagging undercurrent of suspicion: one&#8217;s labours are sadly counter-productive. One feels a subterranean sense of shame. One edges towards cynicism.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opportunities for job and wealth creation are missed</span></i><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The evolution of new and very important industries depends upon enough people recognising that they need and want things that hitherto have not been on offer. At its best, this would mean better targeted offering that had an important contribution to make to people&#8217;s pursuit of <em>eudaimonia</em> &#8211; a happy life. But successful innovation of this kind relies on there being a sufficiently large receptive audience; a large enough constituency of people with the requisite bit of self-knowledge in place &#8211; so they have an appetite for the new product or service.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9781" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3646757720_a0e93deb0f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problems around self-knowledge lead to problems in the economy. And one big idea starts to look tempting: does this show we should start dismantling our present economy, built around freedom of choice, and try to replace it with one that’s more directed &#8211; one that limits the scope given to the individual? That was tried in the Soviet Union and other places. It clearly doesn’t work&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other option is to address our problems around self-knowledge. This is more hopeful for two reasons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: We’ve got lots of evidence that self-knowledge can be improved; only, up to now, the process happens in a slightly haphazard way. It’s far from impossible, only it&#8217;s not organised.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4946657144_27fd314f54_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9783" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4946657144_27fd314f54_z.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="FR Society 29: Couple Shopping in Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: Gains in self-knowledge benefit the individual, because (as we’ve been saying) a gain in self-knowledge is really a gain in knowledge about how to live a happier life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And this is one of the principal routes along which we could collectively advance towards a much better economy. Governments are hugely committed to improving the economy and direct vast resources to this task. They should be turning a lot of attention to the philosophical question: how can we improve consumer self-knowledge to maximise the chances of consumption going well?</span></p>
<p><b>A CONSUMER SELF-KNOWLEDGE EXERCISE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assistance around self-knowledge would most usefully come from the company of a wise friend: In their absence, we may have to do it ourselves.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, the thinking-friend asks a range of carefully targeted questions and listens carefully to our answers. But on our own, it’s possible to recreate this beneficial experience by listing some central questions and writing answers to them.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we set out certain questions which provide a framework for self-knowledge.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Money</span></i></p>
<p>– Do you get anxious at any point in your financial life? Elaborate …</p>
<p>– Who in your past had the best relationship to money in your eyes? Describe their attitudes.</p>
<p>– Who had a problematic attitude? What was going wrong?</p>
<p>– How much money do you need? What do you need it for? Be as precise as possible.</p>
<p>– Do you think some people have more money than they need? Explain your answer.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4001186273_845987e5bd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9787" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4001186273_845987e5bd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4001186273_845987e5bd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– What have been your worst financial decisions? What was the mistake? Why did you make them? What lessons should you draw? Have you been able to fully absorb the lesson? If not, what is the difficulty?</p>
<p>– To what extent do you link your economic status to the idea of a successful life (to what extent do you link money and happiness)?</p>
<p>– How well (or badly) do you deal with financial administration in your own life? If this is less than ideal, describe your troubles. What do you think you have them? In theory, how could you improve this? In reality, why don’t you?</p>
<p>– Do you waste money? Go into detail … Describe one instance. Why did you do this?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Travel</span></i></p>
<p>– In fantasy, what would be your ideal holiday? Elaborate as much as possible. What is it about this that appeals so much to you?</p>

<p>– What has in fact been your best travel experience? Go into detail. What was it about this that went so well? Why doesn’t it happen more often? If you could bottle an insight here, what would it be? How seriously do you take this insight?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What would your ideal traveling companion be like?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Why do you travel? When travel is voluntary, what motivates you? To what degree are these motives fulfilled?</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Technology</span></i></p>
<p>– Does anything stress you or annoy you around technology?  Go into detail …</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15851429459_765bc76e17_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9791" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15851429459_765bc76e17_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="15851429459_765bc76e17_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– Do you ever feel you should have a digital detox? What does that phrase suggest to you?</p>
<p>– Do you feel you waste time online? If so, describe a typical way this happens.</p>

<p>– What machine would properly help you to live the way you’d like? Do you have it?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your Relationships</span></i></p>
<p>– What was your parents’ relationship like? To what extent has that influenced your ideas about what can go well or badly around consumption? To what degree have you learned good lessons from that history?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12436421153_bb8d25721d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9793" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12436421153_bb8d25721d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="12436421153_bb8d25721d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>– In what way could you be a better partner? Realistically, why don’t you change?</p>
<p>– What degree of imperfection can you tolerate? Go into detail around how you have actually accomplished this?</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and Food</span></i></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The entrepreneur is one of the key figures of the modern economy, though what an entrepreneur does is perhaps not entirely properly understood.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are certain conspicuous activities of entrepreneurship: raising capital, running factories, organizing supply chains or working out how to take existing products to new markets (how to increase sales of electric cars in Australia, for instance).  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14153691690_de6a94461d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9631" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14153691690_de6a94461d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="14153691690_de6a94461d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But then there’s a more private and primary first move behind entrepreneurial activity, which might be called sensitivity: in particular, sensitivity to pleasures and pains that others might overlook… or not take seriously enough or not fully focus on.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can sound like an odd point. We don’t automatically associate entrepreneurs with being highly sensitive people. We’re more likely to associate sensitivity with non-commercial individuals like artists. Our point, though, is that entrepreneurs actually have this quality in common with artists. Collectively, our culture has understood the role of sensitivity around the arts, but not yet fully grasped its important role in entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p><b>The Artist</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two essential ways artists display sensitivity: to pleasure and to pains.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artist&#8217;s Sensitivity to Pleasure</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9626" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval.jpg?resize=635%2C522" alt="etretat-the-beach-and-the-porte-d-aval" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1880s, the largely deserted, rugged coast of Normandy was visited by the impressionist painter Claude Monet. He was particularly attracted to the cliffs near the village of Etretat. Many local people and one or two rare visitors must occasionally have had the fleeting thought that it was a charming place as they drew up a fishing boat on the sand or collected the iodine rich kelp. The difference with Monet is that he took the pleasure of looking at the cliffs very seriously. He painted a series of works closely examining how beautiful the light was at different times of day and he studied the pattern of shadows on the rocks. For him, the cliffs were the source of an important pleasure and he painted them so as to get other people to share his enjoyment. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Artist&#8217;s Sensitivity to Pain</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9627" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz.jpg?resize=400%2C656" alt="Brooklyn_Museum_-_Isadora_Duncan_29_-_Abraham_Walkowitz" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early years of the 20th century, a dancer and choreographer called Isadora Duncan grew more and more frustrated by the pains of constrained Victorian clothing. Everyone else seemed to take it for granted that women and men should spend their days encased in highly formal and elaborate costumes, with corsets, buttoned arm-length gloves, stays and high collars. But instead of just suffering in the usual way, Isadora Duncan focused her attention on it and became determined to fix the problem. That’s why she decided to start dressing her dancing troupe in short, light, flowing tunics. Suddenly one could &#8211; for the first time in centuries on the stage &#8211; see bare legs. The history of 20th-century fashion owes an enormous debt to Duncan. It is she who liberated our bodies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A decade later, the architect Mies Van der Rohe started to get fixated on the pains associated with visual chaos and squalor in cities and homes. He was frustrated by domestic architecture that was fussy, cluttered and complicated. Similar thoughts must have occasionally occurred to many people. But Mies van der Rohe held his annoyance very clearly in his mind and set out to find a solution. In 1927, he designed the Barcelona Pavilion which showed how these pains could be avoided in a simple and gracious way.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9628" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.png?resize=635%2C287" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These were artistic insights. But they were later taken up by other more business-minded people and evolved eventually into major commercial enterprises, like the tourism industry of Normandy, the casual clothing business and the field of modernist property development.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9629" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.jpg?resize=400%2C301" alt="Le Grand Hotel Cabourg - MGallery Collection" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Grand Hotel, in nearby Cabourg, built in 1907</span></h5>
<p><b>The Entrepreneur</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receptive antennae, highly attuned to pleasures and pains, are not the exclusive possession of people we call artists. An artist is not so much an individual who is necessarily more receptive than any other kind of person. What distinguishes an artist is that they use their sensitivity to make things like pictures, ballets or one-off designs for buildings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another possible outcome, and that’s one where sensitivity is channelled directly into commerce. The pattern is less familiar, but it’s positive impact on our lives is potentially greater than the work of even the most celebrated artists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbnb originated in a distinctive experience of pleasure that was taken very seriously by the co-founder and CEO Brian Chesky. He really liked having new people to stay on blow-up mattresses in his apartment; it was fun meeting them over breakfast; there was a nice atmosphere, because he was really helping them out. He was also taking very seriously the pain of not being able to find a place to stay when wanting to go to an industry conference.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13874449935_34e26e1019_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9635" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13874449935_34e26e1019_z.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="13874449935_34e26e1019_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hands of an artist this could have led to some impressive works of art. There might have been a fabulous installation around the theme of inflatable beds; or perhaps a specialist art book of moody photographs. These works would have sought to convey to others the surprisingly charming experience he had of having paying guests in his own home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founding a company grows out of exactly the same original insight. But it has a bigger ambition. Instead of just telling others about how nice this could be, the business directly enables other people to have the same satisfaction themselves. And it is then able to share this pleasure on a very large scale.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9637" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z-1.jpg?resize=635%2C342" alt="8379801740_33bb2d95a3_z (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artists traditionally have been very alive to their sensations: they’ve noted things that delighted them; they’ve noted constraints, discomforts, sorrows and frustrations. And they’ve made works of art to hold our attention more securely on these important but fleeting impressions. We need entrepreneurs to register their own pains and pleasures with equal devotion. For this task, the history of the arts offer an inexhaustible fund of inspiration for the entrepreneur.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To build a business many other familiar skills have to be brought in as well. But all the financial and managerial efforts are ultimately going into orbit around the original insight. Boiled down to its essence, business is the commodification of a moment of sensitivity.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not simply noting that up to now there have been some impressive cases where businesses have emerged from the sensitivity of a few remarkable entrepreneurs. We’re highlighting a key ingredient of entrepreneurial activity. We’re imagining (and praising in advance) the entrepreneurs of the future, who will progressively investigate more and more of the pleasures and pains of existence &#8211; just as artists up to now have mapped the same terrain. So we should start to lessen the sense of distance between the activities of the two groups of people, who have often been seen as entirely different human types: both artist and entrepreneur build off the same crucial base of acute sensitivity taken very seriously and brought ambitiously to the attention of others.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our societies are exercised around the question of whether the advertising industry, on the whole, is good or bad. It can be a bit disconcerting that we are relentlessly solicited by people trying to sell us things. One might in some moods wonder if the world would be better place, if there were a lot less advertising going on. But the fact is, the amount of advertising is increasing all the time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to shift the focus to a more specific and more productive question: what is a good advert? Our goal is better advertising, not less advertising.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can answer this by considering the six key things that put people off advertising, and then looking at how these problems can be put right. Bad ads go in for:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Shouting</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sentimentality</span></p>
<p>– Cliché</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sexual vulgarity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Nastiness (which means giving encouragement to the less admirable sides of human nature, like snobbery and selfishness)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Boosterism</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are the six things that people tend not to like and resent in ads that go in for them. These are the things that inadvertently undermine an advert’s power to persuade and to sell. They are, in their way, commercial errors.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5379457132_93c7803345_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9602" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5379457132_93c7803345_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="5379457132_93c7803345_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly, some big clues to fixing these selling errors can be located in art. Art seems a strange place to turn because we generally suppose that art and advertising are polar opposites. A car insurance billboard seems light years away from, say, the National Gallery of art in London or Washington. Artists usually take a dim view of Capitalism while advertising agencies are central to it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16252593627_5993774a68_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9604" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/16252593627_5993774a68_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="16252593627_5993774a68_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But below the surface there’s a shared ambition. Art often gets us to like things. A work of art is frequently trying to get us to share an enthusiasm or buy into an idea. And this is what adverts are aiming at too. Over a very long time, art has developed techniques and skills around emotive persuasion. Many of the things that can go well or badly in adverts have been revealed over centuries in quite helpful ways in the world of art. Art has found solutions to many of the moves that can go wrong with advertising. </span></p>
<p>We want to look at the ways the six core problems of advertising have been resolved in art. The point isn’t to suggest that adverts should become more arty, but that they can become more effective at reaching people and selling products and services by absorbing some of the moves that have been rehearsed across the history of art.</p>
<p><b>The six errors bad adverts make:</b></p>
<p><b>ONE: SHOUTING</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When adverts shout, badger and pester they’re of course hoping to get our attention and influence our behaviour. The problem is that shouting is not usually a good strategy. It comes across as slightly desperate. We know from personal life that when we’re sure about what we have to say and we’re confident about why it’s a good idea, we get less &#8211; rather than more &#8211; shrill. We’re likely to get worked up and shouty when we don’t feel there’s much hope that the other person will find what we have to say persuasive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In art, the advantages of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not shouting</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been carefully and very widely attended to. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9579" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agnes Martin, <em>The Rose</em>, 1964</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agnes Martin is emphatically quiet. But she’s got plenty of notice. She’s cottoned onto the notion that inviting close attention is a great way to get heard. We lean forward to catch the whisper. So we really listen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s recognised a central fact about how to get inside people’s desires &#8211; which is the great ambition of advertising. It can be hugely effective to be reserved. Actually it’s something we know about in personal life, but tend to forget in commerce. The person you want to confide in isn’t the loud, rolliking character. It’s the quietly warm individual who might be a bit hesitant, but who is discretely signalling that they are very interested in who we really are. Agnes Martin is teaching us an initially paradoxical idea: that you can sometimes communicate better by turning down volume.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many adverts haven’t yet discovered the virtue of quiet as a strategic insight of communication.</span></p>
<p><b>TWO: THE ROSE-TINTED AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many adverts that present a perfect view of the bit of life in which the product or service they are promoting is supposed to fit. They suggest that families are entirely happy and couples are totally sweet. They insist that a holiday should be entirely lovely, a living room immaculate, a cruise an endless sequence of perfect moments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such ads can be accused of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentimentality</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they are editing away all the grittier aspects of reality. The urge to be sentimental emerges in response to an anxiety: the worry that nothing can be attractive or appealing &#8211; in fact loveable &#8211; if there are any problems around it at all. At certain points in the past, there was quite a lot of sentimental art around. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9580" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image01.png?resize=550%2C623" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Artists don&#8217;t know how to do this any more… ads still have to learn (Emile Munier, <em>Girl with Doll and Dog</em>, 1882)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this kind of art ran into a couple of serious problems. The over-insistence that something is perfectly lovely readily produces the opposite effect from the one intended. Instead of being convinced, the viewer quickly becomes sceptical and cynical. The rose-tinted image starts to look a bit like a cover-up. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/idylle-1851.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9581" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/idylle-1851.jpg?resize=550%2C659" alt="idylle-1851" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">William-Adolphe Bouguereau, <em>Idylle</em>, 1851</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of being enchanted by the perfect, unchanging love and fidelity of this couple, audiences soon started having the reverse ideas: she’s having an affair, but hasn’t made up her mind to tell him or they assumed the artist might be untrustworthy and lacking in insight: if this was his idea of love, he obviously couldn’t be relied upon to know much about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sentimental ad runs the risk of making people cynical and disappointed around products. So there are people it doesn’t reach at all well or people who get resentful because they sense that the product has been oversold. Sentimentality is commercial strategy that brings a submerged set of risks with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the early 20th century, art learned the lesson and sentimentality almost completely disappeared from gallery walls. The solution isn’t to focus remorselessly on what’s grim. Instead, the idea has been to help us see what could still be very sweet and attractive about what’s otherwise ordinary and very far from perfect. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9582" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image07.png?resize=635%2C635" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kay Westhues’s famous image of children blowing bubbles we’re made aware that things could be a bit tough at times around these children. The older one might be really quite mean to the younger one at times; getting out the door to go to school could involve tantrums. But the loveliness of this unusual moment of tranquility has been held onto. The artist is confident that we’ll recognise that some things are extremely nice &#8211; even though they are not perfect. Indeed, the admission that things aren’t perfect is precisely what will help us to trust in the authenticity of what is being proposed as properly good.</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: THE SEXUALLY VULGAR AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex is frequently used to sell us things. We’re not saying don’t use sex to sell. Clearly it works and taps into some aspects of our natures it would be best to accept rather than rail against. It can sound like a paradox, but the lesson from art isn’t to avoid sex. It’s that there’s a lot more potential around using sex to sell than most ads seem to have realised. Art has been good at identifying the less obvious ways that people can be sexy. It finds sex-appeal in slightly overlooked places. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9583" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image00.png?resize=635%2C425" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>William Eggleston, <i>Untitled, 1960-1965</i></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The US photographer William Eggleston was good at locating where sexual allure might be lurking. The couple in the corporate hallway aren’t conventionally good looking or glamorous. But there’s an erotic undercurrent.  </span></p>
<div class="image_sidebyside size-full">
                         </p>

<p>
                         <div class="clear-both"></div>
                     </div>
<h5>Michael Peter Ancher, <em>A Young Girl Reading</em>, Maren Sofie Olsen (1885); Gucci advertising campaign</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saying an ad is vulgar isn’t really a complaint about sexiness per se. What’s actually bothering people is where the ad is turning to in order to get us excited. The young woman reading in the work of the famous Danish painter, Michael Ancher, is sexy &#8211; in an unobvious way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The work is showing a bigger understanding of people &#8211; one that knows that sexual attraction is quite wide ranging and encompasses aspects like reading quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art reminds us that we can play the sensuality move for a great many audiences that may not yet have been reached by the more conventional approaches of advertising.</span></p>
<p><b>FOUR: THE CLICHED AD </b></p>
<p>This is the kind of ad that picks up on some very well-established features, which everyone has already noticed. It tells us that the car is good, because it can go from 0 to 70 in just a few seconds, that the computer is desirable because its memory is vast and fast and that the washing machine should be yours because it makes clothes extra clean.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are good qualities. The trouble is, advertisers are not homing in on any fresh reason why someone might love a product. And, therefore, they miss customers and opportunities to emotionally cement people to products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see the fixing of cliché in action around portraits. Usually a portrait is trying to show what’s nice about a person. The question is, what ideas of niceness does the artist have in mind? </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9587" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.png?resize=635%2C611" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The official photo of the 55th US Attorney General, Homer Stille Cummings, was keen to show what was good about the man. And to this, it draws on a list of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">familiar &#8211; and clichéd &#8211; qualities &#8211; respectability, honour, dignity. They are genuinely admirable facets. The problem is they miss quite a lot of other things that we actually do very much like about people.</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9588" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image13.png?resize=635%2C421" alt="image13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Kennedy</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time photo portraits were done of the 64th Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, art had learned this lesson. The image is alive to facts that &#8211; at that time &#8211; people sort of knew but were in the habit of brushing aside. It’s actually extremely lovely that Robert Kennedy was a warm-hearted father and put up his daughter’s wonkily sweet artwork in his very grand office. It’s attractive that he rolls up his sleeves before checking the clauses of the 1962 Manpower Development and Training Act.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The error of cliché is that it misses very real and powerful ways in which we find things nice. In Paris, in the 1880s, everyone wanted to live on the lower and middle floors of apartment buildings. These had prestige. A lot of selling was based on how nice the view was onto the street. Nobody wanted to live on the top attic floors &#8211; with windows to the back. Usually that was where well-off people made their servants live. The rent was minimal in comparison with the grander floors below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9589" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.png?resize=340%2C529" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then artists started to draw attention to some rather unexpected things. Paul Cézanne lived in an attic. But he didn’t think it was a problem. It was his ideal choice, because he started to detect some surprisingly lovely aspects to the views. He liked painting the vista over the chimney tops and sky lights and ridges of the neighbouring roofs. He wasn’t hostile to the facade: in Paris they are nice too. But everyone was on to that. What Cézanne was doing was discovering another really nice thing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/toits_paris-b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9590" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/toits_paris-b.jpg?resize=535%2C435" alt="toits_paris-b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Paul Cézanne, Rooftops of Paris, 1881</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a huge commercial insight: today, penthouse apartments very often have the highest rentals &#8211; thanks to the art-adverts of Cézanne and other artists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cézanne wasn’t making it up. He was sensitive to a very appealing feature that a clichéd approach to selling had missed.</span></p>
<p>FIVE: THE NASTY AD</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is nastiness? It’s encouragement offered to quite bad parts of ourselves. We’ve identified nastiness in a few critical but tightly defined areas. We’ve learned in recent decades to totally avoid the racist or sexist ads which, some time back, were fairly widespread.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9591" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image04.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many other areas of nastiness in ads that aren’t yet so clearly outlawed:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a lack patience</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a dismissive attitude to certain people</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- strong sense of entitlement </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- snobbery and smug elitism </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the emotionally misleading advert (a watchmaker, for instance, who insinuates that the way to being a better parent is to buy one of their watches.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is ads of this type strengthen unfortunate parts of the self. Art has worked out a different strategy. Over a very long time it has discovered how to appeal to our better natures. Artists have found techniques for promoting attitudes that help us become the people we really want to be. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpgBlog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9592" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpgBlog.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="the-north-gate-of-the-citadel-1834.jpg!Blog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christen Kobke,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The North Gate of the Citadel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 1834</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish painter Christen Kobke, for instance, was very interested in helping his fellow inhabitants of Copenhagen move away from their natural tendencies to selfishness and snobbery. His paintings suggests how nice it is that a smart cadet lounges on the bridge with less socially elevated companions. He wanted to remind us how everyone is touched by the same things: the gentle flow of water, a mild, sunny afternoon, the comfortable pleasure of doing nothing very much around other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kobke is making a useful point for our commercial environment. He’s directly addressing half-formed hopes for our lives and advancing a wise image of how to live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One could imagine Kobke-inspired adverts for breakfast cereal, a menswear chain or a bus company (which could make use of his approach to being comfortable around strangers). </span></p>
<p><b>SIX: THE BOOSTERISH AD</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosterism energetically promotes things that aren’t really very helpful to us. It loudly informs us that everyone else is keen on something or that if we don’t join in we’re a bit strange. It’s a strategy deployed to sell things like phone upgrades (when actually the old version was more than good enough) or to get us to think that we ought to want a very complicated dish at a restaurant (when actually a much plainer version would be rather nice).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art hasn’t actually disdained boosterism. But it has deployed it in more helpful ways. Essentially, boosterism is saying: this thing is great, you should like it, other people do, don’t get left behind, and in fact there are things that deserve to be energetically promoted. It’s a question of what is being boosted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Japanese artist Hiroshige was a master of boosterism. One of his big projects was to talk up the appeal of rainy days. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9593" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine.jpg?resize=423%2C646" alt="800px-Hiroshige_Atake_sous_une_averse_soudaine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hiroshige is advertising rain: rain is nicer than you currently think…</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rain doesn’t sell itself. We’re so attuned to the attractions of sunshine that we see rain as a misery to be avoided as much as possible. Hiroshige felt that rainy days were beautiful. He loved the way people enter their little sheltered private world under an umbrella &#8211; and how lovely it is when someone else shares that space with you. He likes the grey outline of buildings seen through the downpour. He made hundreds of boosterish woodcuts advertising rainy days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This art lesson translates into the world of advertising, because there are lots of things we might like that aren’t yet foregrounded. We’d like to see Hiroshige-inspired campaigns boosting:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A car that doesn’t go very fast</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A phone that’s hardly got any features</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Tourism in places that get quite cold</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– A smart restaurant that serves sandwiches</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim is to get into the foreground things that could be thought as weaknesses &#8211; and present them as desirable &#8211; because, in fact, it would be great if we had a more positive view of the less obvious virtues of people, places and things.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s nice that there’s a lot of good art around that’s learned skills of effective persuasion. But art isn’t actually the most important place where good techniques can find an outlet. They’ve been rehearsed in art. But it matters a lot more that they get used in adverts. Up to the 20th century, art was big and ads were small. Now it’s the other way round. Ads constitute a very much larger part of consciousness than art. The ambitions which have been so impressive in art should now move closer to the centre of our society and our lives; the best skills should be deployed in the places where they can have the biggest positive impacts.</span></p>
<p>A better ad can’t just be worthy. It has to be a better selling instrument. And the way it can sell better is by reaching more deeply into people&#8217;s lives &#8211; in short, understanding better how people work. For this key task, the history of art is a resource waiting to be mined and put to work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A substantial portion of the modern economy is devoted to the production and sale of what are commonly referred to as luxury goods; the ‘luxury sector’ is estimated to comprise as much as 20% of the GDP of the world’s 20 richest nations. It is in this sector that we can observe humans doing something rather unusual: paying more for things than they strictly have to; investing more than is absolutely necessary in the business of travelling from A to B, protecting themselves from the cold or providing a receptacle for keys, phones and a purse.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bag.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9489" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Bag.jpg?resize=362%2C327" alt="Bag" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, we shouldn’t associate luxury goods merely with sky-high prices; that would be to reduce a useful term unnecessarily. We should take it to refer simply to any kind of purchase where we are paying somewhat more than we would need to if we were solely fulfilling a material need &#8211; and where something else, something more psychological, appears to be motivating our behaviour. We are involved in luxury purchases when we want not just any stapler, but a very particular, slightly costlier one with an intriguingly moulded upper body; and not just any coat, but that one with the cashmere collar and jade-coloured buttons. What properly defines luxury isn’t a high price per se but a price that is higher relative to other goods in a category. We could, by this definition, speak of luxury socks and luxury butter, luxury envelopes and luxury pencils.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image011.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9424" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image011.png?resize=500%2C434" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is traditional to associate the purchase of luxury goods with greed, or a desire to show off &#8211; but this approach entails an enormous loss in our capacity to understand the real drivers of the economy and the nature of our appetites. The way we buy ‘luxurious’ things belongs to a project long associated with philosophy: that of defining and communicating our identity; that of knowing and then letting others know who we are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The birth of the luxury sector can be traced back to 18th-century England. It was then that revolutions in production and a rise in income for the first time allowed a sizeable share of the middle classes a freedom to choose from among a range of goods and services. Suddenly, one could pick one of many kinds of soup tureens or lamps, side-tables or sherry glasses &#8211; and in doing so, had to ask oneself a new kind of question hitherto absent from the act of purchase: who am I in the world of objects?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shopping.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9491" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Shopping.jpg?resize=608%2C342" alt="Shopping" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Whenever we survey options for our possessions, we are at heart searching for items that will ‘fit’ our identities. We are looking to find versions of ourselves in a physical idiom. Every material object simultaneously possesses a psychological identity, which we have a powerful though usually somewhat unconscious sense of. The phenomenon can already be observed in something as apparently simple as our relationship to fonts:</p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vc1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9461" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/vc1.png?resize=445%2C30" alt="vc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We could, if asked, swiftly arrive at an intuitive sense of the different personalities on offer: Verdana feels contemporary, unfussy and democratic &#8211; whereas Cambria emphasises tradition, modesty and a certain politeness. They are two fonts and at the same time, two kinds of people. If we were asked to choose a font for ourselves, we would instinctively try to generate a match between letters and our own characters. We would be searching for a version of ourselves in the world of fonts.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly the same concerns might be at work when we choose an alarm clock. Here too we would be looking to find a fit between a time-piece and an aspect of our inner selves and might reject a succession of options not because they didn’t tell the time well, but because they were betraying who we felt we were.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Braunalarm.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9457" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Braunalarm.png?resize=635%2C346" alt="Braun:alarm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>                                       Searching for &#8216;me&#8217; in the world of alarm clocks.</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is frequently an ‘aspirational’ quality to the way we go about settling on objects. The word is tricky, and is usually interpreted from a monetary and status point of view, as if the only things that any of us ever aspired to be was rich and important. But in truth our aspirations stretch far beyond this; to be aspirational in our purchases just means that we are aspiring to buttress, or concretise, aspects of ourselves that may at present still be evanescent or feint. This can mean any number of psychological features. We might be aspiring to build up such qualities as calm or intelligence, reliability or cosiness. The objects we buy tell us not just who we are, but also who we want to be but perhaps aren’t quite yet.</span></p>
<p>Material objects matter deeply because we generally find it very hard to tell people about ourselves. Our acquisitiveness is seldom greed, it is an urge to tell others what we value. There may be few opportunities to do so other than through things: words can be hard to find and others are in a hurry. We are lent important assistance in our communicative urge by our clothes, our cars, our watches, our kettles and our glasses. Almost everything we consciously pick for ourselves is involved in the tricky task of defining our identity and conveying it to others. We are looking for our possessions to remember and then eloquently convey to the world who we are and long more firmly to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2091515534_4e1347f348_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9463" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2091515534_4e1347f348_z.jpg?resize=635%2C594" alt="2091515534_4e1347f348_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fair sense of what is at stake in our possessions dignifies the act of shopping &#8211; and suggests how much work we still have to do to help the process go right. To shop well emerges as a quasi-philosophical process dependent on an awareness of who we might be and in turn, what identities the objects on offer are proposing to us. The way in which we discuss shopping rarely bothers to delve as far as this: customer reviews tell us how objects perform materially or technically, but precious little attention is ever paid to what our cars or lamps, pens and phones are talking to us about, what their characters are and to what sort of human beings they might hence be best suited. We should be more explicit about the ‘ideal selves’ implied by objects. We should get more skilled at decoding the psychological messages that accompany objects and tag them &#8211; so that we might, for example, search websites not by price or brands, but by the psychological identities opeating in a category. If material objects are a language, we need dictionaries to help us to spell out the psychological meanings.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t, it seems, entirely yet understand how the luxury sector works. We think of it in terms of indulgence &#8211; and celebrate and condemn it as such. But in truth, whenever we pay somewhat more for the things we use, we’re almost always involved in an act of communicating an intention about ourselves to the world. We’re trying to tell others who we are in the language of things &#8211; a crucial civic activity as well as a highly respectable and noble part of being human.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The average manual that accompanies a product &#8211; maybe a domestic appliance or a car, a piece of clothing or a phone &#8211; is a deeply unassuming document. It tells you bluntly &#8211; often in a language that feels like somewhat unclearly translated German or Japanese &#8211; how the thing works, whom to call when it doesn’t and what kind of voltage it might be wise to use. Most manuals are, unsurprisingly, hastily perused or left unread entirely, thrown in the bin and stuffed at the back of drawers.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00-21.11.19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9467" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00-21.11.19.png?resize=450%2C627" alt="image00 21.11.19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If there’s one category of authorship that seems entirely opposed to that of manuals, it is the novel. The novel is our most prestigious literary genre, it aims to tackle the most important themes; it wants to endure over lifetimes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the two genres &#8211; the manual and the novel &#8211; are not, in fact, as different as one might at first assume. Novels are, at heart, trying to put words to how important things in the world work and help us to navigate its currents. A given novel might be trying to tell us how adolescence functions (<em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>), or adultery (<em>Anna Karenina</em>) or snobbery (<em>Vanity Fair</em>) or death (<em>The Death of Ivan Illych</em>). Novelists will unpick our feelings towards, for example, a tentative spring sunshine or an unfriendly schoolteacher. They are in the business of helping us decode the dynamics of the human and natural worlds. An effect of reading them is that we start to pay attention to feelings we might previously have experienced but missed through haste or confusion. We take on some of the sensitivity to the world that the novelist had; our lives thereby become richer, clearer and less lonely.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3798154872_1af338efe7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9476" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3798154872_1af338efe7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="3798154872_1af338efe7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might assume that literature could not in any way perform its work around material objects. But, in truth, these objects are seldom merely physical, they have rich psychological identities that do, in fact, infiltrate our thoughts and generate complex feelings in us. A relationship to a car or a coat, a phone or a lamp can over time assume some of the significance that novelists otherwise accord only to the natural or human world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, presently, despite the size of the material economy, most of these emotions go by entirely unattended in literature, for they don’t fit the dominant, culturally-prestigious sense of what deserves attention. Manufacturers compound the problem by sticking resolutely to a material interpretation of their tasks; their manuals tell us how their goods work, never what it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feels</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like to use and live alongside them. No company has ever before invited a novelist to help to work on a manual.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9478" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet.jpg?resize=550%2C639" alt="675px-Marcel_Proust_et_Lucien_Daudet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only on rare occasions in the history of literature has a writer broken the rules and picked up on the subtleties of our relationships to things. Gloriously, one of the central characters of perhaps the 20th-century’s greatest novel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a car: Marcel Proust devotes many pages to what it feels like to drive around the Normandy countryside in an early ‘Unic’ automobile. We read about the different sounds of the engine in high and low gears, about the feeling of seeing the countryside recede in a rear-view mirror and about the almost religious way in which, at night, the car’s powerful headlamps light up trees and throw shadows across ancient walls and graveyards. In the spirit of Proust’s prose, the American novelist Nicholson Baker devoted a no less fascinating essay to charting the emotions one might have towards the air conditioning vent of a modern passenger aircraft.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Unic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9486" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Unic.jpg?resize=560%2C380" alt="Unic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is through literature that we are given vital encouragement to deepen our emotions towards aspects of our lives. It should be possible to stretch the legitimate subjects of literature to include consumer objects. The ideal outcome is that we can love the things we buy with greater consciousness – which means appreciating their merits and the emotions we come to feel around them.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chipperfield.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9487" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/chipperfield.jpg?resize=506%2C342" alt="chipperfield" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>To help this happen, we need to reinvent the manual, as a guide not merely to the physical life of objects but also to their psychological resonances. Companies should spend longer on, and devote more care to, the small books they publish alongside their wares. When acquiring a new item, we should be given a book on how the machine works and also a more sensory document charting the emotions that our use of it might provoke and reward. It would be a huge benefit to have in our culture stories whose central characters were not always people but, just as importantly, phones and cars, washing machines and hotels. The manual cries out for re-invention as a legitimate object of literary talent and curiosity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Businesses often provide us with manuals, so we can better use their services and products:</p>
<ul>
<li>a technical dossier comes with your new car or washing machine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a folder in the hotel room, with instructions about what to do if you want to adjust the temperature or have some shirts pressed at short notice</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a flat-pack set of shelves and cupboards is accompanied by an instruction booklet showing you how to put all the bits together</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there are signs telling you how to reach your departure gate</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a safety card in the pouch in front of you on the plane telling you how to inflate the life jacket</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a leaflet arrives with a new credit card</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/125377874_23002a0e65_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9380" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/125377874_23002a0e65_z.jpg?resize=635%2C542" alt="125377874_23002a0e65_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, manuals are quietly charming, with encouraging pictures, numbered diagrams and little arrows. And one feels a burst of affectionate gratitude, when one has been carefully shepherded through a tricky task to a happy outcome: the self-assembly bed is finally up; one’s playlist is at last blasting out on the car stereo; one has found a way to record the talent show. Generally, though, manuals veer towards the tedious and the pedantic and we regularly dismiss them to the back of a drawer without a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these manuals are touching on a crucial ambition. They aim to bring us to an ideal relationship with the things we have purchased. Their approach to this task, however, is limited to addressing purely technical, physical challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are interested in the areas that current manuals tend to neglect. Beyond understanding how a product works, the real goal is to help a consumer have a good </span><b>psychological </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship with the thing they’ve bought.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9387" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="15180175779_7e898c9c25_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with good psychological relationships to people, this involves two fundamental issues:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to love it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ideally the customer feels real affection for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the thing they have bought. They are warmly appreciative of the hotel, the car, the washing machine or the assistance they get from their financial advisors. We know this sometimes happens &#8211; but it is elusive and rare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to deal with the challenging aspects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a product or service. Being around another person inescapably involves disappointments and frustrations. But in a good psychological relationship one copes with them; they don’t derail affection. No product or service can live up to every fantasy one might have about it. A car will start to age; not every employee in a hotel can have a winning personality; inevitably some investment strategies will be less successful; a restaurant will sometimes get very busy and service will get stretched. In reality, no business can ensure that things will always go as planned, and the question of how to maintain love through tricky patches becomes important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understanding how to develop good psychological relationships to products and services we should be looking at </span><b>Culture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, broadly defined as the arts. It can sound like an improbable place to turn for help. But Culture is a repository of thousands of years of attempts to have good relationships with bits of the world. We’re understandably a bit blind to this, because Culture has generally been extremely suspicious about offering its insights to the world of business. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9354" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Caspar David Friedrich, <em>The Watzmann</em> (1824-25): he is trying to get us to love mountains, not get us to buy one</h5>
<p>Culture is a resource waiting to be tapped, because it deals with the same basic issue as companies: how do you develop a good psychological relationship to something. The lessons embedded in Culture can be extracted and redirected to places where we need them today: in our relations to products and services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying something and loving it are slightly different: buying it is the beginning. Learning to love something involves two big factors: properly appreciating the pleasures it offers and dealing with the sorrows that can be connected to it.</span></p>
<p><b>Pleasures</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a slightly strange thought that we might need to learn to enjoy something. But quite often pleasures are experienced in a fleeting, low-key way and we don’t fully recognise them &#8211; just as at a reception where you need to raise an issue with an important new contact, you might barely notice the taste of the unusually delicious canapés, until someone mentions how nice they are and turns the spotlight of your attention on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what culture does so brilliantly across a wide range of experiences. We can think of culture as a toolkit for registering pleasures that we were maybe too distracted or intimidated to notice &#8211; because they didn’t seem to fit the accepted notion of where pleasure could be found. Culture has built up techniques for getting us to attend to novel pleasures, and hence to come to love things that, up to then, we didn’t realise we could.</span></p>
<p><b><b>a. How culture helps when we are too distracted to notice</b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9355" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg?resize=635%2C296" alt="1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku,_Pine_Trees" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Hasegawa</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 16th century, the Japanese artist Hasegawa developed a new subject matter for screen paintings: ghostly pine trees glimpsed through the mist. Prior to Hasegawa, it was hard to notice how nice such a sight is. As they walked through a garden, people must occasionally have had a fleeting sense that this could be rather lovely. But in the paintings, Hasegawa focuses our attention &#8211; he isolates the experience. He singles it out from of the mass of other distracting things and says: this is worth special notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the encouragement offered by the artist, it would feel a bit weird to get excited about this kind of scene: you’d fear other people would have no idea what you were on about. You don’t want to be the one person who says &#8211; this is brilliant, when everyone else thinks it rubbish (we like having some hints around that others will respond positively). The Japanese artist gives pine trees in the mist glamour and prestige. You start to look out for this kind of pleasure yourself. You might find yourself daydreaming about an autumnal trip to Kyoto.</span></p>

<p>For most of human history, people didn’t have much time for hedgehogs. Lots of people must have had a vague sense that there is something charming about them, but this low-wattage feeling would have been swamped by the entrenched habit of regarding them merely as pests with dangerously sharp bristles and an annoying tendency to chew up lettuces and petunias in the garden. The more positive attitude didn’t come into focus until an eccentric 18th-century English vicar in the village of Selborne became deeply fascinated by hedgehogs and wrote movingly about them in his pioneering book, <em>The Natural History of Selborne</em>. And thanks to his perceptive enthusiasm, the hedgehog emerged from ignominy to be seen as one of the most endearing of all small creatures.<strong><strong><br />

<p><b>b. How culture helps when we are too intimidated to notice</b></p>
<p><b>Joseph Beuys</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German artist Joseph Beuys got very interested in materials that we generally don’t find in any way special. He was particularly attached to felt, which was mainly used as a packing filler before the invention of styrofoam. It was seen as a deeply weird interest at first. Artists working in three-dimensions were supposed to be dealing with high-status materials like bronze and marble. But, gradually, Beuys’s enthusiasm became persuasive. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9358" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="infiltration-for-piano" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By wrapping revered objects &#8211; like violins and grand pianos &#8211; in felt, he revealed the kindly, protective character of this inexpensive cloth. A piano, which hardly anyone can play well, could emerge as friendly and funny as a baby elephant.</span></p>
<p><b>Bernd and Hilla Becher</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old cooling towers are mostly thought of as eyesores. And generally they would be thought unworthy of love. It would seem bizarre to get excited by them. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9359" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg?resize=550%2C663" alt="113.tif" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Bernd and Hilla Becher, <em>The Cooling Towers </em>(1959-77)</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drawing our attention to their design &#8211; and getting us to look at them more generously &#8211; the artists Bernd and Hilla Becher reassure us that it’s actually not so strange to feel affection for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These moves that generate love &#8211; by direction, attention and making it feel safe to like something &#8211; have been around for a long time in art. But they can also be very helpful in our encounters with things we buy. We can imagine how they might play out </span>in the world of manuals:</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9360" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg?resize=480%2C360" alt="hqdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Miele washing machines</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the manual is explicit about the technical abilities of a Miele washing machine. It guides us to admire the way the automatic dispensing system releases the liquid detergent in two phases and it draws out attention to the advantages of the Quick Power Wash cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the idea that we might come to really like &#8211; and even love &#8211; the machine depends on noticing and appreciating a wider range of its features. The revised ideal version of the manual would also point out that the experience of closing the door is remarkably satisfying. The rubber round the opening rim is of unusually high quality and when the door is closed the glass fits against it with perfect precision. And it’s very nice to sit on the floor and peer through the glass as clothes tumble around. The heavy drum and quiet motors make a rather lovely low, rhythmic sound. You might want to linger for a while because it’s so soothing. It is &#8211; in its way &#8211; an invitation to a kind of meditation.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9361" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="bmw-330d-touring-7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indicator makes an especially pleasing clicking sound. Also the handbrake is a delight to use: it feels smooth and light and yet not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> light: you sense its power.</span></p>
<p><b>A holiday resort:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9411" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="5686057305_836543e92a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hotel information package will let you know you can collect a towel from the bar and that it’s advisable to book a lounger before 10.30am when things tend to get busy. It’s all set up so you can spend some time sunbathing. But at the moment a manual would leave things there. We already all know everything about why we like sunbathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a lot about why sunbathing is nice which maybe we haven’t thought of yet &#8211; and the hotel manuals of the future would be on hand to guide us to them.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9409" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg?resize=635%2C619" alt="540874976_bbb49eda8c_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basking in the sun, we become a slightly different &#8211; possibly nicer, more sensuous, more kindly &#8211; versions of ourselves. However luxurious the surroundings, the main ingredient we’re enjoying at this moment is purely natural. Nature is beneficent, we don’t have to strive. It’s an important corrective to the habits of mind we’ve generally adopted to cope with life in northern cities where mostly it’s overcast and damp and we feel we cannot be loved except in relation to what we achieve.</span></p>
<p><b>Sorrows</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good relationship can’t just be about enjoying the good thing. It also involves being helpful when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two fundamental ways in which things go wrong psychologically around products and services: they don’t live up to our hopes and, however perfect it is in itself, a new purchase turns out not eliminate all the other problems in our lives. Let’s look more closely at each issue in turn.</span></p>
<p><b>When the things we buy don’t live up to our hopes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising increases our hopes and hints that the object will improve the whole of our lives. They set the bar so high that in reality no goods or services could quite live up to them. The hotel, car or dishwasher you buy might be pretty nice, but you’ll constantly be reminded (often by advertising) that there are much nicer things around. No matter what you have, someone somewhere has something better. The trouble isn’t really with the thing we’ve bought, but with our psychological relationship to it. We’re deeply prone to envy.</span></p>
<p><b>The troubles of life continue</b></p>
<p>You might have a furious argument with your partner about who does what when it comes to laundry &#8211; and the rather nice washing machine is the witness to some lacerating encounters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car is great, but while driving it you will experience many times of anguish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s also important because no matter how good the thing we buy is, we can always end up being very distressed in its company. It was a point made originally by one of the first great philosophers of consumption: the Greek thinker Epicurus. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9363" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="epi006" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He observed that the power of the object to make us happy is, at crucial moments, weaker than the power of the rest of what’s happening in our lives (trouble at work, a row with one’s partner, indigestion, fear of missing out) to make us miserable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical manuals are generally unfazed by the idea that the object may be less than perfect. They include trouble shooting sections and give the number of a helpline. They mention money back guarantees and replacement warranties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the whole, this doesn’t extend to the psychological area. Adverts are often sentimental: in the sense that they are devoted only to showing us the good sides and are effectively in denial about the darker, more disappointing aspects of a product or service. They operate with the natural &#8211; but mistaken &#8211; idea that if you want a relationship to go well you must always insist that everything is just great all the time. But we know a good friend doesn’t behave like this. They don’t abandon us when we&#8217;re down. The relationship is damaged. It gets stronger and deeper when disappointments and troubles are faced together. </span></p>
<p><b>Culture has often investigated how we build relationships around things going wrong or being very far from perfect.</b></p>
<p><b>Virgil and Dante </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9364" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells the story of the Italian poet Dante&#8217;s journey through Hell &#8211; during which he encounters many deeply disturbing things &#8211; like the river where those who have been guilty of vicious anger torment one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dante is accompanied by the Roman poet Virgil. When Dante is terrified, exhausted or confused, Virgil is on hand to support him. Virgil the ideal companion: patient, generous &#8211; and well informed: he can explain, reassure, contextualise and put things in perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good companion isn’t preventing bad things happening &#8211; they can’t do that. Life is radically imperfect and we’re bound to encounter many troubles. Rather than pretend troubles can be always avoided, they help us cope. </span></p>
<p><b>Robert Frost</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9365" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg?resize=635%2C640" alt="800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things culture has become very adept at is letting us know that we are not alone with our troubles. It often shows us that people who look sedate and respectable (as the poet Robert Frost generally does in photos) might really understand and share some of our more harrowing moments. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquainted with the Night</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been one acquainted with the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have outwalked the furthest city light.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have looked down the saddest city lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have passed by the watchman on his beat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When far away an interrupted cry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Came over houses from another street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he’s talking about his own sadness, it’s quietly comforting to hear. It doesn’t make the pain go away, but it takes away an edge of panic &#8211; the terrible feeling that one is uniquely marked out for misery.</span></p>
<p><b>William Eggelston</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9366" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="troubled_waters_c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photographer William Eggleston was fascinated by small town gas stations. Especially ones run by the modest Arco franchise. The forecourts are not very prepossessing, but he wasn’t turned off. Although they are not the sort of thing you are supposed to like, he realised that he did. He liked their comforting melancholy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arco themselves, however, are less aware of their own appeal. When they advertise, they try to suggest their stations are more sleek. It’s a missed opportunity. We’re often quietly moved and drawn to things that are a bit run down, very imperfect and a touch melancholy.</span></p>
<p><b>Marcel Proust </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9367" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the narrator goes on holiday and stays at a grand hotel at the seaside, on the Normandy coast. He has a lovely room with a sea view. The management has gone to great lengths to make it elegant and cosy. But his first night there is very difficult. The unfamiliar objects keep forcing themselves on his attention; he can’t settle down to sleep. There’s a very pretty clock, but its quiet ticking drives him crazy. It’s actually no louder than the clock in his bedroom at home, but familiarity has accustomed him to that and made it ‘disappear’. He hasn’t got anything to complain of to the manager: it’s not really a complaint about his luxury room. Rather he’s describing a problem of first nights in new places and there’s nothing the staff could do to put it right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing about this, Proust is getting close to his readers: he’s put his finger on a common enough frustration: I book a nice hotel room, then I had a bad night. But it doesn’t mean I hate the hotel.</span></p>
<p><b>These ideas about our troubles and sorrows have been around for a very long time in Culture. How could they play out around commercial products and services?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should acknowledge that things can go psychologically wrong around the objects and services they offer.</span></p>
<p><b>Miele</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you build up hopes around our machines. We have done everything we can to make them good at washing clothes. But often tensions accumulate around doing the laundry. It seems unbearably repetitive, even pointless sometimes.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so tempting and natural to imagine that this car will have consequences beyond itself. You will be happy, with your partner, with your work. But many things will go wrong. We know that &#8211; and we are a gentle Virgil keeping you company around the horrors that can unfold in the back of cars. Someone will quietly reject you. The traffic will snarl up when you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot be late </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a crucial meeting.</span></p>
<p><b>Hotel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are problems travel cannot solve. When we go to a new place we tend to forget that there is something we cannot leave behind: ourselves. When travelling alone many people find they get lonely or melancholy in a hotel room; families squabble, couples get on each other’s nerves. We can put a flower or a bonbon on your pillow in the evening, but there are many causes of restless nights.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/43723177_f9c54452ac_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9420" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/43723177_f9c54452ac_z.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="43723177_f9c54452ac_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, manuals have been doing an important task. They have been showing us how to get the most out of the things we buy and how to deal with the difficulties that might arise. But they have done this only around technical matters. What we’re saying is that the psychological relationship to goods and services is just as important. Because many of the things than can go well or badly are psychological: they are to do with our hopes, fears, what we notice and get excited by and what disappoints us. The ideal outcome is that we can love the things we buy &#8211; which means appreciating their merits and bearing with the ways they let us down. It’s the same as what happens around loving another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving goods and services is a big ideal of good capitalism. It can sound a touch romantic &#8211; but it’s actually the best relationship from an economic point of view: it’s the best source of profit. What we’re saying is that there’s a whole range of issues that companies can address to help their clients love what they provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help this happen, we need to develop a new kind of literature, which might be called commercial literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great traditional ambitions of literature has been to tell the story of how a couple moves through hope and disappointment to lasting, secure and mature love. We actually have many relationships in our lives, and in the modern economy, many of these are to do with the things we buy. It would be a huge benefit to have in our culture a lot of engaging stories about how people come to a similarly mature love for (for example) a car, a hotel, or a washing machine.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We&#8217;re used to the idea of sex being used to sell stuff. It happens all the time, usually around cars, or perfumes. Or even less substantial things like ice creams.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/static4.businessinsider.com/image/5193e94e69bedd4f49000000-480/dolce-gabbana-gang-rape-ad.jpg?resize=477%2C357" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Making use of another human being&#8217;s sexuality to generate an enthusiasm for consumer products seems a pretty depressing manoeuvre &#8211; demeaning as much to buyers and producers.</p>
<p class="p1">But before we despair of our shallowness, let&#8217;s go back a few centuries to consider the educational theories of one of the greatest Renaissance Italian philosophers, Marsilio Ficino.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9287" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="Zaccaria_in_the_temple_by_dghirlandaio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Marsilio Ficino, far left</h5>
<p class="p1">Ficino was unfazed by our tendencies to be interested in sex. This was, he thought, simply an inevitable consequence of our bodily nature, which dictates that our initial interest in things will almost invariably spring from our sexual and sensory faculties.</p>
<p class="p1">The reason Ficino was undisturbed by this is that this wasn&#8217;t in his eyes the end of the story. Though our interest in things may well begin at the sexual level, this is merely the starting point: the destiny of our interests is to move on to a stage of higher engagement that Ficino called &#8216;love&#8217;.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9297" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=537%2C664" alt="Filippo_Lippi_-_Madonna_col_Bambino_e_due_angeli_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">And from there, we may ascend to a third stage: the longing and capacity to understand.</p>
<p class="p1">So our interests are naturally inclined, if well tended, to follow a path from sex to love to intellectual engagement &#8211; and this holds true for an interest in people, in virtues and even in abstract ideas.</p>

<p class="p1">Ficino was above all else an educator. That is, he thought profoundly about how people learn and how one can best teach people.</p>
<p class="p1">And so he concluded that the best way to get an idea into someone&#8217;s mind is not to try at once coldly to engage their reason &#8211; it is first to reach them via their senses and in particular via their interest in sex.</p>
<p class="p1">Ficino was employed by the great Renaissance patron and statesman Lorenzo de Medici: both were desperate to educate as many people as possible in Florence to be wise and good, using the lessons of antiquity and Christianity. And they wanted to use art to do this, launching what was in effect a giant ad campaign for the highest goals.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9294" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="892px-Botticelli_Uffizi_37" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Ficino&#8217;s ideas lent this educational programme a unique angle. Ficino proposed that the artists Lorenzo was employing should devote themselves to painting successions of beautiful, or plain sexy people.</p>
<p class="p1">We may have often been struck by how many attractive people there are in Renaissance art: this is no coincidence. It&#8217;s a deliberate consequence of Ficino&#8217;s educational theories. Artists &#8211; guided by the philosopher &#8211; were commissioned to use sex to sell: but sell the highest things, like piety, virtue and modesty, commitment to the intellect and devotion to scholarship.</p>
<p class="p1">It&#8217;s a manoeuvre we&#8217;ve come to forget in our own times. We still use sex, but only ever to sell the lowest things.</p>
<p class="p1">And when it comes to the highest things, we deem them above the grubby task of being sold &#8211; and therefore, they languish.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4682302967_1bdc122a23_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9305" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4682302967_1bdc122a23_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4682302967_1bdc122a23_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">With Ficino&#8217;s lessons in mind, we should be more strategic. We should recognise that there&#8217;s nothing wrong with using sex to sell: so long as what we are selling happens to be noble. Indeed, selling higher things with sex is a generous act that graciously acknowledges how our minds really work. We cannot or should not be expected to learn without our senses first having been lit up.</p>
<p class="p1">We just have to make sure we&#8217;re selling the right things, not cars or confectionery. But perhaps things like a book devoted to wisdom and philosophy. Ficino would have approved.</p>

<h5>Xu Zhen’s Supermarket</h5>
<p>The Shanghai-based artist Xu Zhen is one of the most celebrated Chinese artists of our age. He operates in a variety of media, including video, sculpture and fine art. His work displays a deep interest in business; he appears alternately charmed and horrified by commercial life. In recent years, he has become especially fascinated by supermarkets. He’s interested, in part, by how lovely they can be.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9135" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image05.png?resize=496%2C334" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xu Zhen loves the alluring packaging, the feel of lifting something off a shelf and seeing multiple versions of it waiting just behind and the exquisite precision with which items are displayed. He particularly likes the claim that supermarkets can provide us with everything we could possibly need; the claim of comprehensiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, Xu Zhen feels there’s something really quite wrong with real supermarkets &#8211; and commercial life in general. The actual products they sell often aren’t the things we genuinely need. The backstories of the things on sale is often exploitative, everything has been carefully calculated to get us to spend more than we mean to. There’s cynicism throughout the system.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, in response, the Chinese artist mocks the supermarket repeatedly. In his work, the products on the shelves look real, you’re invited to pick them up, but then you find out they are empty, as physically empty as Xu Zhen feels they are spiritually empty. His checkouts are similarly deceptive. They seem genuine: but you get a receipt and it turns out to be a fake; you’ve bought ‘nothing’ of value.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket installation takes us on a journey: at first it is getting us to share the artist’s excitement around supermarkets and then it&#8217;s puncturing the illusion: it’s all a big, deliberate let down: the products look tempting but they are full of nonsense and don’t really nourish us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s highly significant that Xu Zhen’s critique of supermarkets is ironic. We tend to get ironic around things that we feel disappointed by but don’t feel we’ll ever be able to change. It’s a manoeuvre of disappointment stoically handled. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9136" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image07.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of art is ironic in its critiques of capitalism; we’ve come to expect this. It playfully hints at what is wrong but has no real clue what to do in response. A kind of hollow sad laughter seems the only fitting response. Criticism melts into irony.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/XuZhen2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9140" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/XuZhen2.jpg?resize=500%2C333" alt="XuZhen2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xu Zhen is trapped in the paradigm of what an artist does. A </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">real </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">artist, we have come to suppose &#8211; and the current ideology of the art world insists &#8211; couldn’t be enthusiastic about improving a supermarket. He or she could only mock from the sidelines. We’ve nowadays fortunately loosened definitions of what a ‘real’ man or woman is meant to do, but there are still strict social taboos hemming in the idea of what an artist is allowed to get up to: they can be as experimental and surprising as they like … unless they want to run a supermarket or an airline or an energy corporation &#8211; at which point they cross a decisive boundary, fall from grace, lose their special status as artists and become the supposed polar opposites: mere business people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d like to take Xu Zhen seriously, perhaps more seriously than he takes himself. Beneath the irony, Xu Zhen has the ambition to discover what an ideal supermarket might be like, how it might be a successful business and how capitalism could be reformed. Somewhere within his project, he carries a hope: that a corporation like a supermarket could be brought into line with the best values of art: psychological and spiritual importance, kindness and wisdom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p>Thousands of miles away from Shanghai, in the flatlands of East Anglia in the northeastern tip of Southern England, just outside of Norwich, lies a hugely impressive modern building completed in 1978 by the architect Norman Foster. The Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts is filled with some of the greatest works of contemporary art: here we find masterpieces by Henry Moore, Giacometti and Francis Bacon.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9138" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="ealnwonlsqkbk3xw2sdj" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/museum-of-the-year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9139" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/museum-of-the-year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="museum-of-the year-2014-nominations-sainsbury-centre-for-visual-arts-world-arts-news_web_image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The collection is made possible thanks to the enormous wealth of the Sainsbury family, which owns and runs Britain’s second largest supermarket chain that bears its name. Discounted shoulders of lamb, white bread and special 3 for 2 offers on tangerines have led to exquisite display cases containing Giacometti’s elongated, haunting figures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The gallery seems guided by values that are light years from any actual supermarket. It is feeding your soul, the curators are deeply ambitious about the emotional and educational benefit of the experience: they want you to come out slightly improved. A visit is a special occasion (though they hope you’ll come often).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a very different direction, the Sainsbury family arrive at a strikingly similar conclusion to Xu Zhen. Art and supermarkets are essentially opposed. And like Xu Zhen, the Sainsbury&#8217;s are caught in an identity trap, though a very different one: that of the philanthropist. The philanthropist is imagined as someone who makes a lot of money in the brutish world of commerce and then makes a clean break. They devote their wealth to projects that are studiedly non-commercial. The philanthropist fears that if they ever took an art-loving attitude to their businesses they would suffer economic collapse. Instead of making big things happen in the real world, they would become mere artists who make little interesting things that live only in the sheltered, subsidised world of the gallery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a strangely tantalising situation. The artist finds something loveable and much that’s wrong around supermarkets, but can’t imagine running one and bring the ideals of art into action in that arena. The supermarket owners love art, but can’t imagine bringing their art-loving side into focus in their business.  They are both like pioneers, at the edges of unexplored territory. There is a huge idea they are both circling round. The goal is a synthesis of business and art: a supermarket that was truly guided by the ideals of art, capitalism that is compatible with higher values.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A supermarket governed by the values of art would not be selling art. It would be a genuine supermarket continuing to sell all the things we use everyday; it would still be focused on the idea that you can go round with a huge trolley and stock up on pretty much everything you require for the coming week. But it would be paying attention to the things that the arts have traditionally valued highly: sincerity, a focus on higher (as well as lower) needs, sympathy for the weak and the poor, a focus on quality and authenticity. The arts have a deeply impressive record of getting people to like things which, initially, didn’t seem at all attractive at first. At their best, they normalise and glamorise what is good. Supermarkets have a great (but currently misused) ability to make these moves. They have normalised lychees and glamorised cold-pressed olive oil. They could do the same for the idea of a just price: items which are slightly more expensive than their rivals because they have been produced under better conditions for all concerned. Or the idea of quality over quantity: one buys a smaller but better portion of cheese, a smaller but better chicken, fewer but better cherries&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, stacking shelves in a supermarket is one of the less sought after jobs: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pic_international_large_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9141" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/pic_international_large_3.jpg?resize=374%2C210" alt="pic_international_large_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, many people are keen to work in art and in galleries. Some will work for almost nothing, but they are willing because they are proud of their involvement: at parties they feel excited to say that they are working at a gallery even if mainly they are sweeping the store room, keeping the mailing list up to date or perching on a ladder.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a3b145748.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9142" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a3b145748.jpg?resize=635%2C481" alt="a3b145748" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These feel like opposite ends of the spectrum. But all that divides them is the idea of what the work means: we think of apples and soup cans as banal and art as special. The true irony is that works of art are often themselves homages to humble things. Cézanne thought apples were deeply wonderful, which was why he painted them. We get closer to Cézanne not so much by looking at the painting, but by looking at what he looked at &#8211; real apples on a simple table &#8211; with his appreciative eye. A Warhol soup can isn&#8217;t saying soup cans are pitiful but art is wonderful. Its meaning is really the reverse. Art is doing its job when it gets us to love the dignity of ordinary life &#8211; and business is succeeding when it provides the conditions for humane and purpose-driven work. A supermarket run under the values of art would be a glamorous, prestigious place to work: people would feel a quiet surge of pride when they mentioned they worked there.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, we have collectively learned to admire the values of the arts (which can be summed up as a devotion to truth, beauty and goodness, expressed via material things) in the special arena of galleries. But their more important application is in the general, daily fabric of our lives &#8211; the area that’s currently dominated by an often depleted vision of commerce. It’s a tragic polarisation: we encounter the values we need, but only in a rarefied setting while we regard these values as alien to the circumstances where we most need to meet them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to simultaneously raise the ambition of artists: to make their ideals powerful in our lives &#8211; and of business: to serve us better. The two ambitions are ultimately very closely related.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket is one example in the wider class of commercial projects that should, ideally, be run according to the values of art, which could include: financial services, property development or home insurance. These corporations could use the ambitions and ideas that at the moment circle around art to better serve the needs of their customers.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In part, what we need to do is get artists out of an ironic mode and equip them with the right skills. We need artists who are good at dealing with employment contracts and balance sheets; who are excited by organisational flow charts and are undaunted by shareholder meetings. At the same time, we need to raise the ambitions of business people, stop them spending their surplus on art, and instead encourage them to invest (for surplus wealth buys you time to make good ideas stick) in making their core activities themselves more in line with the spirit of art. We should be seeking to make money via the values of art, rather making it in disregard for those values, and then funding a museum. That is the challenge for the future.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little to the side, or on top of, what it produces and sells us, the average company tends to have an overall identity which we’re used to referring to as its ‘brand’. A company’s brand isn’t strictly limited to what is being offered for sale to customers, it comprises its characteristic way of going about things, its values, beliefs and philosophy. If the company were a human being, we’d say the brand was its personality.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because companies are in the business of fixing people’s problems, every brand holds out to customers what we might term a ‘brand promise’. This isn’t linked to any one single service or product, it is seldom directly stated but is present in many of the company’s declarations and manifestations (especially its advertisements). We could say that a company’s ‘brand promise’ is the distinctive contribution a company is suggesting it might make to human happiness.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9062" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM.png?resize=635%2C413" alt="Screen-Shot-2013-01-25-at-3.57.19-PM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audi is in the business of making high performance cars. The advert above is, narrowly, trying to sell us a particular range of convertibles with good sound sytems. However, it also contains a ‘brand promise’. This seems to speak about how we could attain happiness &#8211; as well as a feeling of dignity, order and control &#8211; via advanced technology. The brand promises to lift us above confusion, squalor, fear and trivia &#8211; through the help of engineering and precision machinery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider another company. British Airways narrowly tries to sell us tickets to get from A to B. But its ‘brand promise’ is a far broader thing: the company is inviting us to buy into certain values: of a life rendered good through infusion with virtues like old-fashioned Britishness, self-command, self-deprecating humour, precision and courage in the face of adversity.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9063" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto.jpg?resize=550%2C644" alt="nadav-kander_british-airways-manifesto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brand promises are at the heart of what creates the emotional connection between a customer and a company. However, these promises also have a tendency to get overlooked by companies themselves. It can be so hard simply to manage ordinary operations, there may be little time to ask the higher order questions: what contribution are we really trying to make to our customers’ happiness? What is the highest purpose which we could attach to this company? What is our mission? How well are we really communicating it? And what products and services could we innovate once our brand promise is more clearly in view &#8211; in order to honour our tantalising promises more systematically?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as to capitalise on the opportunities that come from knowing one’s brand promise a little better, a company should learn regularly to analyse itself and the sector it operates in. Imagine an ambitious luxury hotel trying to stay afloat in a competitive market. Imagine that the hotel’s brand promise is around calm (all its advertisements hint at this), yet the day-to-day struggle of management is around delivery and the brutal fight with new competitors. In order to get a handle on its brand promise, the company needs to step back and ask the largest questions that it may have bypassed for too long: What is ‘calm’ really? What exactly is a ‘good’ night in a hotel? What if one went back to the drawing board and asked what contribution a hotel could make to the challenges of calm?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, hotels don’t think these sort of problems belong to them; they might say they’re for philosophers (whom they rarely meet). They limit their focus to the soaps, the appearance of the room, and the difficulties of staff retention. In other words, they’re forgetting the full range of implicit promises they’ve made to their customers: you will be calm &#8211; and happy! &#8211; with us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/aman.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9064" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/aman.jpg?resize=635%2C294" alt="aman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A hotel that took its brand promise of calm very seriously might be led to develop a whole range of new services and products. Hotels, like so many businesses, are only at the dawn of understanding their customers’ real needs, because they operate with an overly narrow definition of how they might live up to the promises that they release.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or take wealth management. On the surface, this is a business that promises customers a certain return a year on their portfolios. But a deeper implicit promise is also present around many firms: ‘you will live well with money around us’. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/130061_bahamas_wm.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9065" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/130061_bahamas_wm.jpeg?resize=526%2C258" alt="130061_bahamas_wm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, very few firms have offerings that are actually connected up with this big promise, which renders them intensely vulnerable to competition and downturns in the market. A wealth management firm keen to deliver fully on a brand promise around ‘a good life with money’ wouldn’t stop looking after money in the standard ways, but it would also be asking bigger questions around how clients do actually flourish (or flounder) around money. How well are the clients’ children relating to money? How has money affected the clients’ friendships? What is the point of philanthropy? What has been the meaning of their lives? As with the example of the hotel, these are questions that implicitly fall under the remit of particular businesses, but these businesses are often not looking at them squarely and imaginatively enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wrestling with brand promises is not an indulgence. It helps management to think more deeply about what a business should properly be trying to do with the customer’s life in order to improve it. There is, fortunately, never an enduring conflict between understanding promises of happiness and making some money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout history, in most societies, bitter feuds have broken out between two rival camps, ‘business&#8217; on the one hand and ‘the arts’ on the other.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the business camp, have been the traders, manufacturers, entrepreneurs, financiers and the more commercially-minded politicians and scientists. And in the arts camp have been not only painters and sculptors, but also philosophers, poets, playwrights, photographers, novelists, gardeners, psychotherapists, preachers and theologians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hostility between the two camps has been fierce. Back in Ancient China, Confucian scholars regarded commerce as simply a lesser form of human activity.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zhu_xi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9021" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Zhu_xi.jpg?resize=345%2C498" alt="Zhu_xi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhu Xi (1130—1200)</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business might be necessary, but it was a shameful life in comparison with that of learning and writing. In 18th-century Prussia, under the rule of Frederick the Great, aristocrats were forbidden by law from engaging in mercantile careers &#8211; which were thought to lack the revered military virtues of courage and honour. For the Romantic poets and artists of the 19th century, business seemed wholeheartedly uncouth and tedious.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Montesquiou_Robert_de_-_Boldini.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9022" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Montesquiou_Robert_de_-_Boldini.jpg?resize=635%2C609" alt="Montesquiou,_Robert_de_-_Boldini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To artistic upper class people like the French writer Robert de Montesquiou, the commercial soul seemed obsessed with embarrassing and faintly idiotic things: fluctuations in the price of guano and the search for cheaper ways of transporting cheese.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst all the criticism of business by the arts, perhaps one stands out above all: business people have, it has been alleged, been deformed by their love of money; greed has withered their souls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has not been enriched by this trench warfare between the arts and business. The two sides would have so much to teach one another if only they could overcome their mutual suspicions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2849400717_a4008b5d59_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9041" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2849400717_a4008b5d59_b.jpg?resize=550%2C621" alt="2849400717_a4008b5d59_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stress on business greed has missed the point. The sort of business people who come in for criticism are not in fact primarily greedy. The more revealing word to use when trying to understand them is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pessimistic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Despite being on the side of money, many business people have been surprisingly pessimistic about how money can be made, which is what ultimately underpins the activities that have led artists to their denunciations. Hard-headed business people are rarely outright corrupt or unnaturally avaricious: but they very often suffer from a curious kind of melancholy, a particular kind of sadness about the world and its inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem like a strange assertion to make. But this sadness shows itself in six big assumptions that operate beneath the workings of business:  </span></p>
<p><strong>One: Customers won’t give a damn about Workers</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A great many businesses employ the very cheapest labour they can find on the planet. They negotiate contracts which mean people will have to work in dangerous or uncomfortable factories and warehouses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s tempting to look at this from the outside and think that it is pure nastiness driving these decisions: employers screw their workers, because they are greedy, but really, it is because they are pessimistic about their customers.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5790840713_716d130f68_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9039" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5790840713_716d130f68_z.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="5790840713_716d130f68_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalists have a primordial need to stay in business. They are ready to do whatever is compatible with this aim &#8211; and if it turned out that paying staff really well and treating them to long lunch breaks was in line with this ambition, most of them would do so at once without rancour or qualm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But they don’t, because of a pessimism about customers. Hard-nosed business people are bleakly sure that very few customers will ever care much about the well-being of their workers. These callous customers won’t give a damn how many eight-year-old children are making their trousers or how much suffering went into harvesting their tea leaves &#8211; and therefore, for businesses to start caring about such issues will simply lead to business failure. After all, the acceptability of price is all in the hands of the audience. It’s not a personal longing on the part of businesses to have people work for as little as possible. The low salaries just stem from a rather pessimistic assumption that unless businesses stick to rock-bottom wages, customers will just go elsewhere and their enterprises will fail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many businesses have internalised this idea very profoundly; the customer is essentially selfish.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: Customers have low appetites that can’t be improved</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a deep fear in many areas of business that high-mindedness, earnestness, and complexity are fatal to sales and that any attempt to ‘raise’ the aspirations of consumers in these directions is guaranteed to lose money.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/carteroutdoor.com/images/featured/5197c.121211.jpg?resize=547%2C402" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>For example, there’s a pessimism around what would happen if you tried buck the trend and promoted something healthy at the fast-food counter, or made certain magazines a bit more thoughtful or didn’t use a particular celebrity to promote your product. It wouldn’t be greed holding back corporate strategists from undertaking such initiatives. It would be a view of human nature. As the business mantra goes: no one ever failed to make money underestimating the tastes of the public.</p>
<p><strong>Three: The only way to sell is through deception</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a painful background belief that in order to thrive, a business must use advertising to make enormous claims for its rather modest products, and ideally connect them up with semi-conscious, exaggerated promises around success and sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The people behind this advert don’t themselves believe that buying a music player is closely connected to the experience of physical intimacy with a gamine beauty or gentle hipster in San Francisco. But they are confronted with some gloomy facts about human nature: that people will as a matter of fact buy music machines if you present them with such images and suggestions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/83644363_9cd7280b59_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9047" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/83644363_9cd7280b59_o.png?resize=400%2C236" alt="83644363_9cd7280b59_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few businesses believe that advertising in its current state is admirable. If they resort to it, it is just from a desolate conclusion seemingly drawn from experience. A company can of course always choose to be above such things but sales will fall, profits will drop, they won’t be able to pay their staff; they won’t be able to raise capital and the whole venture will fold. You can participate in this charade &#8211; or you can be poor.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: You can only make big money from the bottom of the pyramid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a striking fact. Most of the big and most profitable corporations on the planet address needs grouped at the lower levels of Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2000px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9024" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2000px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="2000px-Maslow's_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These businesses are efficiently targeting basic needs: for shelter, security, communication  and energy. They are engaged in real estate, mining, oil, insurance or transport. None of these industries are currently very focused on any ambitious sense of what happens around their products. The oil company doesn’t care much what your journey is about, so long as you travel a lot; the real estate corporation isn’t concerned with the kind of life you live in your apartment, so long as you pay the rent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that people in business simply don’t care about meaning, creativity and the pursuit of self-knowledge. It’s just that they have a pessimistic conviction that it is extremely hard (and almost impossible) to make money from these more elusive and private concerns.</span></p>
<p><strong>Five: ‘Work’ is the word for what no one would do unless they were paid</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a belief at large, infecting the world of business, that work can’t usually be something people will feel deeply engaged by. So awful will the work be, people will just dream about the holidays and retirement. Employees are motivated primarily by money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if you want to recruit better staff or get people working more effectively, the key thing is to offer higher salaries. If you want a government agency to run more effectively, privatise it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any other thoughts about why people might work &#8211; in order to improve the lives of others, or to find an outlet for their own better natures &#8211; end up sounding simply naive and hopeless, romantic fantasies at odds with the cold facts of business life.</span></p>
<p><strong>Six: You can’t afford to care about the psychology of your staff</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is no reflection of personal indifference to the inner lives of others; it’s just (so many people in business feel) a fairly crucial fact about running an enterprise.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4646164016_3b0efa734a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9052" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4646164016_3b0efa734a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C211" alt="4646164016_3b0efa734a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start getting cosy and concerned about the people who work in your organisation, that’s very nice from a personal point of view, but it takes too much energy and focus away from the harsh (but essential) task of turning a profit. And if you don’t turn a profit, it doesn’t matter how kindly you feel towards your employees, you won’t be able to give them the one thing they actually most want from you: a job. Business requires the softer or more generous aspects of one’s nature to be held in check.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is these pessimistic ideas about commerce and work that lead many companies &#8211; and the people who run them &#8211; to appear greedy. But we believe that the decisive factor here isn’t actually greed. It’s a pained vision of life in which any higher aspiration seems at once condemned to failure. A business has no option but to try to turn a profit, and that means it has no option but to operate by certain notions of the demands and psychology of its clients and workers. And this, the argument goes, requires the kind of capitalism we currently have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big claim we are making is that this pessimism is not in fact always warranted and that in order to overcome it, business should look to an unusual source for inspiration: the arts. The arts &#8211; we propose &#8211; possess a welter of antidotes to much of the underlying and painful pessimism of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this antidote has never been explored, it’s no coincidence. It’s because business has some deep suspicions of its own when it comes to the arts. The whole field seems simply utterly useless. When you look round at what really counts in the world, none of it seems to have anything very much to do with the arts. The big corporations are concerned about millions of things &#8211; drilling rights, exchange rates, employment laws, tax credits, regional instability, technological advances. But the arts appear to be entirely marginal to all this. They are just an upmarket area of entertainment, a hobby. You might know of a CEO who paints watercolours to relax; or a wealthy family who subsidise the opera. This isn’t a problem at all. But it shows you where the arts fit in &#8211; you might get involved in the arts, once you have made money. The arts use up money, they don’t make it. Furthermore, though in theory we live in a post-gender era, the arts retain markedly and negatively ‘feminine’ connotations. Business inevitably involves tough choices; it sets a premium on the idea of being strong and masculine. So anything that hints at softness is suspect &#8211; as rendering a person unfit for the key tasks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In essence, for business, the arts look like something you might get interested </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">once</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you have succeeded. But they can’t help you succeed.</span></p>
<p><b>WHAT THE ARTS CAN OFFER</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But both sides have, in this arena, been too pessimistic. There’s a way of considering the arts which brings out a hitherto unexplored and highly intriguing degree of value for business.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7887428226_47ab6787db_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9050" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7887428226_47ab6787db_k.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="7887428226_47ab6787db_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right mindset, we can go through the six pessimistic assumptions, one by one, and see alternative &#8211; more optimistic &#8211; attitudes that are systematically available through the history and practice of the arts.</span></p>
<p><strong>One: The skill of exciting Sympathy</strong></p>
<p>Art refuses to believe that humans don’t care about one another. It is extremely ambitious about the possibility of emotional connections between strangers. The whole basis of many artistic works has been the desire to create sympathy where none initially existed.</p>
<p>A primary skill of a good artist is the art of teaching us to see a common humanity beneath the surface anonymity and otherness. In the 19th century, George Eliot saw her primary task as a writer as that of helping us appreciate ‘all that is ordinary in human life’ and attuning us to the minor joys and sorrows of others, down to ‘the squirrel&#8217;s heart beat …’</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_DAlbert_Durade.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9025" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_DAlbert_Durade.jpg?resize=350%2C423" alt="George_Eliot_at_30_by_François_D'Albert_Durade" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Mary Ann Evans (who was published as ‘George Eliot’) extended the reach of sympathy</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her novel </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middlemarch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teases out the hidden dignity and honour of people living unglamorous lives &#8211; a small scale builder, a very modest farmer, a carpenter, a servant, a poor clergyman. She got large numbers of readers to feel kindly and concerned about these characters; she added new regions to the map of sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her technique didn’t involve telling her readers they ought to care. She didn’t scold. Instead she described people’s lives carefully, feeling that the more we know about how other people are and feel, the more we will care. She was deeply against overt didacticism and lecturing about the plight of the poor. Eliot’s style was ‘psychological realism’, she gave her readers a sense of what it was to be other people, and then let readers come to their own conclusions &#8211; which they have been doing successfully for over a hundred years. </span></p>
<p>One character, in <em>Middlemarch</em>, Caleb Garth works as a surveyor for a new stretch of railway line that’s being planned. He’s not a very impressive figure, he never makes much money and he doesn’t do anything very dramatic. But George Eliot carefully describes how he thinks and feels about his own work and as she does so, our sympathies expand:</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘You must love your work, and not be always looking over the edge of it, wanting your play to begin. You must not be ashamed of your work, and think it would be more honorable to you to be doing something else. You must have a pride in your own work and in learning to do it well, and not be always saying, There&#8217;s this and there&#8217;s that—if I had this or that to do, I might make something of it. No matter what a man is—I wouldn&#8217;t give twopence for him&#8221;—here Caleb&#8217;s mouth looked bitter, and he snapped his fingers—&#8221;whether he was the prime minister or the rick-thatcher, if he didn&#8217;t do well what he undertook to do.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Eliot is demonstrating a technique for widening empathy &#8211; namely a realistic presentation of what actually goes through the minds of those who are currently overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Eliot may be one of the most famous writers in the world’s most influential language, but she remains a very small deal on a noisy, distracted planet. Nevertheless, her example justifies a degree of confidence that wider sympathy can be engaged; a sympathy for bricklayers and surveyors, but also garment makers, tea-leaf pickers, fast-food workers and (in case we forget) bankers and CEOs. So, the pessimistic view that customers are selfish &#8211; and can’t care about the workforce, and so won’t bear the costs connected with that care &#8211; isn’t really correct.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: The skill of raising taste</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raising taste, means helping people come to a new appreciation of qualities and things that they hadn’t been much interested in before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The history of culture shows some extraordinary possibilities for getting people to care about new things. For example, up until around 1919 no one had really thought that you could like a painting even though it was completely abstract &#8211; and didn’t try to represent anything.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cri_000000265883.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9026" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cri_000000265883.jpg?resize=470%2C512" alt="cri_000000265883" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then along came Piet Mondrian who created a revolution in taste. He avoided painting trees or sunsets or mothers and babies so as to focus our attention more clearly on some distinctive abstract qualities: harmony, balance, purity. Mondrian was shaping and raising taste: he was assisting his audience to see the attraction and value of things of which they would otherwise have been sceptical. And he was amazingly successful. A painting by Mondrian now costs the price of a small jet aircraft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mondrian didn’t start out with the gloomy idea that everyone is already fixed in their preferences &#8211; and so the only way to sell anything is to go along with the choices people are already making. Otherwise, he would have stayed with the sunsets and babies. He approached public taste with the justified optimism that, in principle and with a bit of time and support, many people can be brought to recognise the appeal of novel (and interesting) things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if this works in relation to lines on a canvas, it must also be able to work in other more important areas than art: in the everyday, immensely significant world of food, cars, hydroelectric turbines, data storage and clothes.</span></p>
<p><strong>Three: You can advertise good things</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business is familiar with the idea of seduction, but it takes a limited view of where seduction can be usefully deployed.  The arts however, have often taken a very positive and ambitious use of seduction. They have used charm to try to ‘sell’ difficult and higher things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ancient Greeks, for instance, often presented rationality (the potentially austere demand that we think carefully and logically) via the god Apollo. But they made sure that Apollo was a hugely attractive character. He looked like a cross between a model and a football player. His hair was always a tumble of locks. His forearms were strong.</span></p>
<h5><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9027" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8c22c967fb577a41bfaac9c41ec29ccb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5>A classical advert &#8211; for wisdom</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The optimistic assumption here is that we can be enticed towards quite elevated, noble or serious attitudes &#8211; with the help of the right sensory associations. We can be brought to confront difficult and painful &#8211; but important &#8211; tasks if they are introduced in a sufficiently alluring way. The very techniques that could be used to sell bullshit can also be deployed in selling wisdom and self-understanding.</span></p>
<p>The underlying idea is that enthusiasm for good things isn’t just the result of purely rational considerations. We get swayed by beauty, by sexual associations and by charm. We should understand and respond to these facts. Of course they can be abused. But they can also be put to very constructive use.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish painter Hammershoi was, in a sense, a businessman. What he wanted to sell us was an attitude of patience, forgiveness and an appreciation of the everyday.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9028" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum.jpg?resize=635%2C633" alt="800px-Vilhelm_Hammershoi_-_Interieur_mit_Rueckenansicht_einer_Frau_-_1903-1904_-_Randers_Kunstmuseum" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to do this, he understood that he would need to make use of all the arts of advertising. So he seductively used the nape of a lovely female neck, delicate strands of unruly hair, and a carefully calculated angle of the head, to get us to like a person and to want to enter their imaginative world. And once we’re hooked by what is &#8211; to put it bluntly &#8211; sex-appeal, he was confident we could be drawn towards tenderness and intelligent sympathy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moralists in the past &#8211; like the Greek writer of fables Aesop &#8211; realised that in order to make their wise correctives to our bad behaviour palatable, they’d have to use a lot of charm. They’d have to do something pretty close to advertising. Aesop invented droll stories about animals. He was sensitive to the fact that we need to be coaxed into a relaxed and playful frame of mind before we can absorb slightly tricky messages. </span></p>
<p>In one of his stories, Aesop wanted to warn us away from ruining for others what we have no use for for ourselves. So he thought up the story of the Dog in the Manger. He tells us of a dog who invaded the cow shed and set himself up in the feeding trough. He didn’t want to eat the hay himself. But he rigorously stopped the cows eating it too. It’s a charming tale, that makes us laugh, recognise bits of our own natures but doesn&#8217;t make us feel defensive or ashamed; it seduces us into accepting a difficult moral.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fable02steinhowel1521.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9029" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/fable02steinhowel1521.jpg?resize=447%2C343" alt="fable02steinhowel1521" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aesop, the Greek sculptors and Hammershoi (along with many other artists) have shared an optimistic view of the techniques that nowadays are overwhelmingly used by advertising. They were ambitious about what they could use advertising for. It wasn’t just about trying to get us to buy superfluous shoes or cars: it was also a way of coaxing people to buy into tricky but important things.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: The skill of commodifying higher needs</strong></p>
<p>The arts address the top level of Maslow’s pyramid of needs: they are concerned with the pursuit of meaning and the exploration of individuality and freedom. At certain key moments, the arts have succeeded in commodifying experiences in these areas and turning them into very profitable commercial operations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, Impressionism &#8211; one of the most commercially successful ventures of all time (if it was a stock, it would be near the very top of most exchanges) &#8211; began when a group of painters living and working around Paris in the 1860s got very excited by the play of light, the delicate tones of shadow and the shimmering reflection of sunshine on water. They had really lovely experiences walking by rivers strolling through gardens and woodland. And they were the first people to work out how to capture those experiences effectively: they did it by focusing not on the actual shapes of thing, but on their own ‘impressions’ &#8211; and by resorting to much brighter colours than Western artist had had recourse to for centuries.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-1897-1899-Monet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9030" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-1897-1899-Monet.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="Water-Lilies-and-Japanese-Bridge-(1897-1899)-Monet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Impressionists went onto develop this practice as a very profitable industry, which generated considerable wealth for all of the founding figures. Yet, it was a very uncynical process. Monet and his friends Pissarro, Sisley and Renoir simply focused as clearly as they could on the things they loved. They defined and intensified a range of lovely experiences that a lot of people wanted to share. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Poppies-Blooming-Claude-Monet-Landscape-Print.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9031" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Poppies-Blooming-Claude-Monet-Landscape-Print.jpg?resize=400%2C280" alt="Poppies Blooming Claude Monet Landscape Print" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Impressionism was a commercial brand, selling its own special take on happiness</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the pessimistic idea that big profits cluster around lower needs isn’t justified. A useful way of looking at the arts is as a set of businesses directed at our elevated needs. There are enormous commercial possibilities at the top of the pyramid.</span></p>
<p><strong>Five: The skill of motivating a workforce</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cynical &#8211; and pessimistic &#8211; idea is that at heart people only really work for money. The fact is though, across history, people have regularly been touched by other big motivating ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Medieval monks who designed and constructed the buildings on the Scottish island of Iona didn’t have competitive salary packages. They worked because they were motivated by an idea that had been compellingly presented to them: that their labour would be pleasing to God. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iona_2606221b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9032" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/iona_2606221b.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="iona_2606221b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And something similar is true of the modern armed forces. People join up not simply because they are going to be paid, but because they are drawn by the idea of serving their country. And they know that this might even come at a terrible price to them. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/british-troops-world-war-i-christmas-truce-soccer-commemoration.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9033" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/british-troops-world-war-i-christmas-truce-soccer-commemoration.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="british troops world war i christmas truce soccer commemoration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The army and the medieval church have a long elaborate tradition of creating motivation and explaining the hugely impressive purpose that drives them. They don’t see this as a minor optional extra. Explaining what the work is for, and generating a sense of its dignity, is a crucial task &#8211; which they take extremely seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Churches and armies don’t have a natural monopoly on the optimistic idea that people will be driven by other things than money. They are just a couple of organisations that have been particularly ambitious around this insight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many corporations in fact serve the public good in important (if less overtly dramatic) ways: they keep a father with a head cold functioning well enough to pick up the children from school; they supply bathwater or provide moments of respite in a busy day in the shape of small savoury snacks. Helping people &#8211; in small but real ways &#8211; can be deeply motivating, if only we have this purpose and our part in it clearly before our eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arts are our best mechanism for transmitting ideas of purpose and ambition. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bigliberty.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9034" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bigliberty.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="bigliberty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Six: How to care about staff psychology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem hard-nosed, efficient and ‘grown up’ to give little attention to what’s going on inside the minds of employees. They are there to do a job. There’s been a tendency in business to give prestige to an attitude of indifference to emotional complications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that there’s a big conviction that staff psychology is actually irrelevant to corporate success. Clearly there are ways in which an employee’s psychological hang-ups or difficulties can compromise a project: someone who is too much of a people pleaser will hold back on raising a difficult issue and thus be dangerously slow to let others know about a brewing problem; problems around rivalry mean good ideas will get rejected because of who came up with them&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real though these issues are, dealing with them has low prestige. They might, in fact be the gateway to greater profitability than cutting a new deal, but the dealmaker will get the limelight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The arts provide an alternative view, in which taking people’s inner lives very seriously is the mark of being successful.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we’ve been seeing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">via the arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is a set of reasons to be less pessimistic about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">business</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An incidental skill of the arts has been to correct the pessimistic account of how money can be made. Specifically the arts do this by identifying a range of skills and ideas around inner life, communication, how to change people’s minds and what you can be ambitious about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we meet these things in the arts, it’s a ready assumption to think that they naturally belong in the arts. But really the arts are only a rather modest outlet for big capacities that exist far more widely. It’s more important that these abilities get used in our major industries than they are used for making things that sit in art galleries and on poetry bookshelves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Society takes the business of making money very seriously indeed. Much of our education system is geared towards giving people the skills to get a good job and a steady income.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, very little attention is given to how to spend money well &#8211; by which we mean, in ways that stand a chance of properly increasing our sense of well-being and therefore justifying the sacrifices that went into earning the cash. The very subject sounds slightly absurd. Surely there is no challenge here, other than making sure we have enough (by which we mean, ever more) in our wallets.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3174937547_dacd881789_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8986" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/3174937547_dacd881789_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3174937547_dacd881789_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the developed world, true basics like shelter and food require only part of an average income. An important slice of consumption is therefore directed at things we don’t absolutely require. Some of the time at least, if we properly reflect on our experiences, this discretionary expenditure doesn’t quite bring us the satisfaction we were hoping for. Certain of the more spiritual voices will argue that the reason is obvious: the whole idea of improving our lives via something one can purchase is fundamentally misguided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another possible explanation: that material things can contribute to satisfaction only if we understand ourselves pretty well. Spending successfully is something we need to learn. We need to undergo a process of Consumer Education, simply defined as the art of better understanding the links between what we spend and how we feel.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20433626229_2b36b086f6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8984" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/20433626229_2b36b086f6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="20433626229_2b36b086f6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why does consumption often go wrong? In part, because we don’t take our own feelings seriously enough. It’s odd &#8211; even a bit offensive &#8211; to suggest that we may not always have a very secure grasp on what we’re actually experiencing; that we could be doing things like buying technology, eating in restaurants, going travelling or choosing outfits and not sincerely be registering our emotions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, we are arguably often very lax about tracking what we experience. This kind of inattention is perhaps easiest to spot in the visual realm. A lot of the time, we see without properly noticing. Our eyes are alive to the broad features of the places we wander through, but our vision isn&#8217;t focused. That&#8217;s what can make art so powerful when it jolts us out of our customary visual lethargy. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf_1503_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8970" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf_1503_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=550%2C640" alt="Albrecht_Dürer_-_The_Large_Piece_of_Turf,_1503_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: normal;">Noticing all we don&#8217;t normally see.</span></h5>
<p>On seeing what the German painter Albrecht Durer perceived in an ordinary patch of wild grass (in a watercolour from 1503), we can sense the difference between focused and casual attention. Durer took note of every blade of grass, and every nuance in the colour of the soil. We don&#8217;t need to be great artists to pay closer attention to the data from our senses. The core move of redirecting attention can be repeated in any realm of thinking or feeling, and &#8211; in this context &#8211; in the area of consumption. Take, for example, a holiday. We are never trained to study our own responses to a trip, in order to determine how we really felt over a nine-night span and what this tells us about who we are and what we need. We don&#8217;t feel we can learn much about ourselves from tracking the peaks and troughs of our moods: and don&#8217;t strive to adjust our spending patterns in relation to our feelings. Instead, we bump into our pleasures slightly by accident and don’t take either our boredom or our joys as seriously as we might &#8211; which makes us vulnerable to never refinding the ingredients of our own satisfactions.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/211400025_d8636f4118_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8973" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/211400025_d8636f4118_o.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="211400025_d8636f4118_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the big claims of modern capitalism is that it provides us with unrivaled consumer choice. Yet we are hardly encouraged to dwell too long on our subjective sense of well-being in relation to purchases. There’s an extraordinary diversity of products. It can seem as if every possible nuance of preference has been carefully catered for. Yet under the surface of this seeming individuality, consumer patterns are surprisingly standardised. Probably you will have bought a certain sort of flat screen TV in the last few years. You are very likely to buy into one of the major phone brands and update it when you are told. You are likely to have taken at at least one trip overseas last year: you probably went to either a beach or one of 12 famous cities around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">None of this will feel like a diminution of anonymity, or the expression of what might (a little brutally) be called herd-instinct. Until one puts these personal free choices into historical perspective.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/agn47535.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8971" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/agn47535.jpg?resize=316%2C600" alt="agn47535" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are very unlikely to possess a ruff and a dress sword &#8211; though left entirely to your own devices there is no particular reason why should shouldn’t fancy the idea. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/G._Borgelli.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8972" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/G._Borgelli.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="G._Borgelli" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how rich you are, you are unlikely to covet a sedan chair carried by two servants wearing wigs &#8211; though this was a very big and common aspiration across Europe in the 18th century, and it could still prove a highly convenient way to move about a large garden or golf course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are so easily able to identify the era of a photo or a painting precisely because patterns of consumption (the things people possess) exhibit large collective patterns which tend to radically circumscribe individual preferences. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10218100.18cff590.640.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8974" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10218100.18cff590.640.jpg?resize=543%2C640" alt="10218100.18cff590.640" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Their tastes, or the tastes of their ‘herd’?</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just an astonishing co-incidence that these German youths ended up (in 1909) wearing almost identical clothes. They are &#8211; instead  &#8211; evidence of a profound fact about human beings: to a very large extent, we buy according to what others are buying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">why</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is there such uniformity in purchasing decisions? How come everyone seems to like many of the very same things at the same time? It’s not strange that we’ve got a bias in this direction. The instinct to follow what other people are doing is a reliable guide to survival for almost everyone outside of a modern society. You have to stick with your tribe; you have to learn to do what the elders (who have clung to life) are doing. You have to be ultra cautious about novelties and individuality because there’s so much catastrophic danger around. We learn to speak by speaking like others. We learn to be part of a team by modelling our behaviour on that of others. It’s only very very recently &#8211; yesterday in terms of the history of the human brain &#8211; that more than a tiny faction of people have had any opportunity to buck a trend, and stand out or pursue a markedly individualistic style &#8211; with that being a good idea. </span></p>
<p>So we should expect our brains to have evolved to be highly responsive to signals about what most people are enthusiastic about (especially people we perceive as being a bit like us). We find it hard to trust something that comes without widespread support; we find it hard to resist the appeals of something that most people find very attractive.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The challenging aspect of this cognitive bias is that, in the conditions of modern capitalism, we become highly vulnerable to all authoritative and beguiling suggestions about what people in general are up to. We end up experiencing adverts as wise messages about what the tribe is doing &#8211; and we follow.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tour_Eiffel_Citroen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8975" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tour_Eiffel_Citroen.jpg?resize=500%2C640" alt="Tour_Eiffel_Citroen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huge commercial interests are constantly seeking to persuade us to join trends: happy people drink champagne; your partner isn’t serious about you unless they give you a diamond ring; water parks are terrific fun etc&#8230;These ideas can become compelling, even when they are not much tethered to our own reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not that the corporations are inherently cynical or wicked. They just have to work hard to persuade you to side with them. The rewards for gaining market share are huge; the punishment for declining sales is draconian. It’s not at all surprising if they get very skilled at getting us to agree with them about what happiness might be like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It takes a lot of strength to stand up to a trend. In mid-18th century France, the dominant artistic trend was the Rococo style. It was excited by sweetly idealised romantic scenes, prettiness, ribbons, gauze and lots of pastel-coloured flowers.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-happy-lovers-1765.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8976" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-happy-lovers-1765.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="the-happy-lovers-1765" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There were some moods and feelings it was very responsive to: like instances of playful flirtation.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Fragonard_The_Swing.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8977" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Fragonard_The_Swing.jpg?resize=635%2C626" alt="800px-Fragonard,_The_Swing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the dominance of the Rococo made it very much harder to recognise the appeal of things which didn’t quite fit its template. One person who held on to his own sources of satisfaction was the painter Chardin. He liked quiet, modest and rather serious domestic scenes. He didn’t like flirtation and bucolic gardens.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-house-of-cards.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8978" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/the-house-of-cards.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="the-house-of-cards" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because he didn’t fit the trend, he was sidelined for many years. But Chardin was very determined and stuck strongly with his preferred approach &#8211; even though it meant great financial penalties. However, quite often we’re not as dogged as he was; we don’t relish battling against the dominant trends of the age.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why the proper process of consumer education starts in a somewhat unusual place: with training on how to focus on the sources of our real satisfactions and in how to hold on to these even when they lack external validation and prestige. It might involve the confidence to know (as Chardin did) that we like quiet domestic interiors when everyone else likes nymphs in pretty gardens, or to realise that foreign holidays or fusion restaurants or a certain kind of smartphone really aren’t for us, whatever our social circle and the adverts we pass on the way to the station would dictate.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13943437120_20175919d7_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8993" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/13943437120_20175919d7_k.jpg?resize=500%2C647" alt="13943437120_20175919d7_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to become better students of our own feelings of happiness. It’s often the case that we seem to stumble across things that we really like &#8211; but don’t take proper note of or extrapolate the principles behind our pleasure. For example, late one evening, we might find ourselves having one of the most interesting conversations of our lives. But we can’t quite discern why it happened. It’s put down to luck and the search for how to create such a feeling again is abandoned. Or we have a terrific afternoon one weekend walking down an old canal, finding a series of abandoned warehouses, which seem to nourish an interest in the history of industrialisation. The activity has no prestige and on our next holiday, we are led &#8211; like a leaf in a powerful current &#8211; to go to Rome, where the guide book directs us to a succession of churches, which we find rather boring (if we are honest, which we aren’t  so much).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are fatefully resigned to the idea that some very good, very pleasurable, things just happen ‘on the spur of the moment’ or by chance &#8211; or are simply matter of luck. But this is precisely where the whole process of consumption starts to go wrong. We are failing to take our moments of happiness seriously enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over time our culture has developed a very different attitude to at least one area of pleasure: the pleasure of eating &#8211; with incredible results. A recipe book is a compendium of rules for reliably re-creating a very particular sort of pleasure; and we have so many by now that the human race can be said to have achieved perfect mastery of the pleasures of the palate. Perhaps the world’s earliest recipe book is called <em>The Book of Dishes</em> (1226) by the Arabic author </span>al-Baghdadi<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It tells us in meticulous detail how to make lemon chicken, pomegranate juice, stuffed vine leaves and olive and goat stew. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image101.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8979" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image101.png?resize=550%2C640" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to recreate the pleasurable feeling of pomegranate juice</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recipes are typically undaunted by the fact that the process of reproducing a pleasure of the palate might be a bit complex, might sound odd to traditionalists, might require special equipment and might have to be rather precise at certain points. This is in dramatic contrast to the way we tend to let other (actually very important) pleasurable experiences rest on chance or simply die in the privacy of our hearts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To come to our central thesis: a recipe &#8211; in its most ambitious version &#8211; shouldn’t be confined to food. We should become the authors of our own recipe books of pleasure. In our private, individual recipe books, we should note what we like, what ingredients were necessary to produce it and therefore, what money and practical arrangements we will in future require in order to recreate the feeling. We need to overcome our surprising haphazardness when it comes to identifying and remembering what we enjoy doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were to focus more closely on our pleasures, most of us are in fact, what was benignly once identified as ‘original’ in the vocabulary of 18th-century England; that is, we are very individual, un-herd like in our essence. &#8216;Originals&#8217; were people secure and confident enough not to worry very much what others thought of them and to let their own pleasures be the guides to their ways of life. The English botanist and naturalist Gilbert White, for instance, realised that the patient study of animals was what he liked above all (no games of cards or dancing parties for him). He therefore devoted all his material resources to tracking down his favourite species and built them nests and homes in his garden. He memorably described discovering that few things gave him as much satisfaction as lying on his stomach in his garden looking very carefully at what the local hedgehogs were up to. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image002.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8980" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image002.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we tracked down our own equivalents of White’s hedgehogs, we might find ourselves slightly re-arranging our priorities. We could discover that many of the things we own bring us no pleasure at all, but that a few &#8211; expensive or cheap &#8211; really do make a difference and might henceforth become more focused targets of appreciation and expenditure. We would depart from the big trends in a range of areas, while delighting in them in others. We&#8217;d let our subjective enthusiasms direct us to extreme frugality in some categories and perhaps unbridled extravagance in others. Overall, our spending patterns would grow helpfully weirder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of consumer education has until now been unhelpfully confused with the idea of reviewing. Reviews are everywhere, but they are fundamentally flawed in tending always to assume that you’ve already decided to make a purchase in a particular product range and are wise to do so; you are just not sure which one to go for. You’re going to get a phone &#8211; but which one? You’ll be booking a hotel in Greece&#8230; but which one? However, what is missing from this mania for reviewing is the bigger prior question, the question of whether a purchase in this category is even necessary to your particular satisfaction. Is it worth getting a phone or going abroad in the first place? What sort of a person am I? What do I, in particular, need to be happy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were better at knowing ourselves, the shape of the economy would change. &#8216;Business&#8217; is nothing more than an attempt to please customers. If many businesses are only partly successful at this, it’s not the result of evil: it’s that companies don’t especially have to mind not hitting happiness targets, because a lot of money can be made via the fact that we make purchases at all &#8211; even if we don’t quite get the result we’d hoped for. Furthermore, it’s currently hard for firms to work out what to give us, given that we ourselves don’t quite know what we want. We need to get better at sending into the market the signals that would help the evolution of capitalism. We should stop going back to the hotel we didn’t quite like, or buying the same not very ideal bit of technology, or ending up in a water park, because we were unable to let manufacturers know what we’d really rather be paying for &#8211; and would happily have switched to if only it had been on offer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re imperfect consumers because of a quite basic challenge of the human condition: we’re not very skilled at making ourselves happy. It’s a tragic irony that the whole point of consumerism is to please us but that on so many Sunday afternoons, on the way back from a film or a mall, the train station or airport, we may privately acknowledge that we have once again not quite been able to lay our hands on the nerve centres of our own pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumption is a point at which modern life dramatically intersects with an age-old issue: the origins of human flourishing. In truth, consumer education is a branch of philosophy, a study of how we can educate ourselves as to the true natures, and constituent features of a good life. The challenge of becoming the authors of our own recipes books of pleasure still lies before us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In modern times, one of the criticisms you’ll sometimes hear people make about certain works of art is that they are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too sentimental</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image09.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8706" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image09.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tendency is to see sentimentality as an unintentionally funny and slightly embarrassing thing about the art of the past. In fact, sentimentality is alive today &#8211; and it’s evident not so much in art, as in a place where we might not at first expect it: in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll get to sentimentality in business in a minute. But first we need to think a bit about sentimentality per se: What is it? And is there anything actually wrong with something being sentimental? </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/song-of-the-angels-1881.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8705" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/song-of-the-angels-1881.jpg?resize=635%2C607" alt="song-of-the-angels-1881" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The basic thing that happens in</span> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sentimental</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">art, is that the negative aspects of life or a situation are repressed; and something is instead presented as wholly nice and lovely.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/young_girl_with_lamb-large.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8708" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/young_girl_with_lamb-large.jpg?resize=635%2C639" alt="young_girl_with_lamb-large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Youth, for instance, is presented as a time of simple innocence; rural life is imagined as pure and always happy; having little money is suggested to lead to an easy, contented existence. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8709" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>Luke Fields </b><b><i>The Village Wedding</i></b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or, a community is imagined as deeply united and content &#8211; a representative snapshot of a peaceful, prosperous and contented nation &#8211; where kindness is normal and everyone is sweet. No one is eaten up with envy or harbours complicated sexual longings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what’s the problem? What’s so bad about doing this?</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem One: It leads to disappointment</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an essay, <em>D</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>e</em> Profundis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; written in prison &#8211; Oscar Wilde defines sentimentality as the desire to feed off an emotion ‘without paying for it’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8710" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image001.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>`</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says: ‘We think we can have our emotions for nothing. We cannot. Even the finest and most self-sacrificing emotions have to be paid for.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a handle on what he’s saying, imagine that I want you to like me, but don’t want to pay the true price of friendship. I want to feel we’re friends (which is a very nice feeling). But I don’t want to back you up when you are in difficulties, I don’t want to hear about your problems or give you tricky bits of advice: I don’t want to actually have to do the things real friends do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I get a warm glow as I invite you to lunch at a non-specific date; or tell you you can count on me, knowing at the back of my mind that I never will live up to the promise… I am thereby being ‘sentimental’ around friendship.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8711" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C642" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jean-Baptiste Greuze, <em>Fidelity</em></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This young woman is presented as totally devoted and loyal; she will never forget how deeply wonderful and perfect her lover is; she’ll never get tetchy about how he holds his knife and fork or how loudly he snores at night; she’ll never wonder if she’s wasted her life or think that her partner’s conversation is dull, his love-making technique inept, his financial status unsatisfactory or his views about political philosophy seriously misguided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentimentality doesn’t want to engage with what Jung calls our shadow sides: our deep tendencies to aggression, negativity, spite, envy and disappointment. These ‘shadows’ are carefully omitted. It’s an attempt to spare ourselves discomfort; but &#8211; ironically &#8211; it has a painful consequence:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sentimental art feeds the tempting delusion that things could be perfect: relationships endlessly charming, countries without exploitation or violence. Unintentionally, sentimentality increases the burden of disappointment with how things actually are.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem Two: Sentimentality breeds cynicism</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilde also argued:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The sentimentalist is a cynic at heart. Indeed, sentimentality is merely the bank holiday of cynicism.’ It’s initially quite a surprising idea, because surely these attitudes are poles apart.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8712" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image11.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Franz Xaver Winterhalter, <em>Family of Queen Victoria</em></span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this sentimental portrait, Queen Victoria’s family is presented as more polite, quiet and mutually admiring than (one feels) any group of people could actually be. The natural troubles of any family &#8211; envy, boredom, guilt, spite &#8211; are kept entirely in the background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unconvincing, airbrushed representations of family life encourage an equal and opposite reaction. Exposure to sentimentality leads many people to suppose that a wholly dark view is likely to be true. So, seeing the picture, one is tempted to think that Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were probably actually quite malevolent parents, who had no real love of their children. They would, the moment the artist had left the room, become harsh and censorious and cold.</span></p>
<p>In the middle &#8211; between sentimentality and cynicism &#8211; is the mature assessment, which usually means acknowledging that things have good and bad aspects that are unfortunately deeply intertwined. Maturity involves giving up on the attractions of a clearer, simpler (but actually unfair) assessment, whether totally negative or totally positive. Maturity means realising for instance that a single person might be both kindly and generous sometimes and quite greedy at other points. Or that a nation might be really quite admirable in some ways and rather horrific in others.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sent2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8724" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sent2.png?resize=644%2C167" alt="Sent2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The art of past eras helps us to see sentimentality in action. But, to be honest, our lives are not generally hugely taken up with looking at portraits of 19th century, royal families or depictions of rural life circa 1875. So, even if we think sentimentality is a bit of a worry, we are not going to panic around these kinds of exposure to its potentially harmful effects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve raised the issue of sentimentality on art as a lead up to an admittedly unfamiliar &#8211; but actually more serious &#8211; issue: sentimentality in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business is at the centre of modern examples of sentimentality. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/ecobabymamadrama.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/JJ-Campaign-Manifesto.jpg?resize=462%2C860" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This advert is designed to encourage people to buy products like Calming Lavender Baby Shampoo and Hand-and-face take-along-packs from the Johnson and Johnson corporation. It is also, sickeningly, sentimental.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It entirely exaggerates the role of love. It tells us that love is ‘the most powerful thing on the planet’ &#8211; as if it is setting out, rather deliberately, to avoid admitting that many other factors are crucial in getting things done; and that the feeling of love &#8211; though it can be very intense &#8211; is far from reliable. One does, in fact, sometimes feel utterly weary of those one loves, frustrated, disappointed (and not nearly in receipt of enough admiration and tenderness oneself).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why would a corporation resort to sentimentality? What is sentimentality for in advertising? It’s partly an expression of deep anxiety: the anxiety that the audience is in no position to face reality. Sentimentality is a symptom of the sheer difficulty of ambivalence. Adverts don’t trust us enough to share a more complicated view of the world with us. They are &#8211; wrongly &#8211; afraid that we might run away completely if we were let in on the secret that their products can’t make us entirely happy, that they are good enough but not perfect and that corporations never really love their customers, they’re trying at best to make them a little happier in one or two areas of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are also tempted by sentimentality in their dealings with their own employees. When companies make general statements about how they approach their employees, the shadow side is typically missing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image041.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8716" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image041.png?resize=635%2C494" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission statement doesn’t dare to tell us that teamwork is hard, or that sadly, a lot of work isn’t much fun. There’s a denial of the reality that the market inevitably creates tensions between the interests of shareholders and the interests of workers (and customers). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two causes of sentimentality in business. The first is a fear of the fragility of the audience, a worry that it won’t be able to cope with the truth. You think the truth is actually OK. But you fear that other people will get excessively agitated and upset. For businesses the shadow side is this: companies have to make a profit. Businesses have to follow demand. Employees sometimes have to be pushed quite hard or fired to raise profits. They are always means, not ends. Many decision have to be based on the bottom line. Because these facts aren’t fantastic, companies get very nervous about being honest around them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, we&#8217;re by nature drawn not to the most delightful things, not to things which suppress the complexity of existence, but those which convey it, and yet still demonstrate a basic confidence and faith.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/N03523_10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/N03523_10.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="Robin c.1912 by Augustus John OM 1878-1961" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>Augustus John,<i> Robin </i></b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augustus John’s portrait of his son is endearing because &#8211; unlike a more sentimental picture &#8211; the child feels real; he could be quite naughty and then very playful; he might maybe make a big fuss about eating broccoli and then pretend to be a lion with a very sore paw; he could be great at climbing trees but also quite mean to his younger sister. The truth is we don’t really warm to perfection; we are too quickly conscious of the lie. But this is an insight that tends to fade quickly. When imagining how to get other people to like us or be loyal to our company or interested in something we’d like to sell them, we too often feel we have to omit all the weaknesses and rough bits. But it’s not what we actually warm to ourselves if we reflect on our experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second reason for business sentimentality is darker. People sometimes get very sentimental when they feel very guilty, when something pretty bad is going on just off-stage. It’s a kind of bubble wrap around brutish things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company that’s mostly spending time desperately trying to extract every cent of profit from its customers will &#8211; in a kind of reactive excess &#8211; declare it’s love for them: </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image10.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8718" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image10.png?resize=452%2C600" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Societies or businesses with a backdrop of pretty cynical attitudes &#8211; where there’s actually a lot of very brutal employee-employer relations and a lot of disrespect for customers &#8211; are also often those where there’s a lot of overcompensatory moves. When the sugar coating has to be very thick, it’s often a sign of something pretty bitter underneath. A company which has traditionally not been very concerned about its impact on the environment might &#8211; in a sentimental boomerang move &#8211; feel very drawn to representing itself with dolphins. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/emmf_dolphins1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8737" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/emmf_dolphins1.jpg?resize=340%2C482" alt="emmf_dolphins" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution to this sort of sentimentality is to relieve the pressure of a bad conscience by changing one’s ways. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Utopia, there would be less brutality, and therefore less cynicism and less sentimentality. We’d be able to discuss the truth &#8211; because the truth felt bearable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can seem as if we’re faced with a stark choice. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can be materialistic: obsessed with money and possessions, shallow and selfish. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can reject materialism, be good and focus on more important matters of the spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most of us are, in our hearts, stuck somewhere between these two choices, which is uncomfortable. We are still enmeshed in the desire to possess &#8211; but we are encouraged to feel rather bad about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, crucially, it’s not actually materialism &#8211; the pure fact of buying things and getting excited by possessions &#8211; that’s ever really the problem. We’re failing to make a clear distinction between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of materialism.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s try to understand good materialism through a slightly unusual route: religion. Because we see them as focused exclusively on spiritual things, it can be surprising to note how much use religions have made of material things. They have spent a lot time making, and thinking about scrolls to hang in your house, shrines, temples, monasteries, art-works, clothes, ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/cdn3.volusion.com/7gorz.q2kns/v/vspfiles/photos/JJ3AG233-2.jpg?resize=449%2C356" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, they have cared about these things for one reason only – because they have wanted material things to serve the highest and noblest purpose: the development of our souls. It is just that they have recognised that we are incarnate sensory bodily beings &#8211; and that the way to get through to our souls has to be, at least in part, through our bodies (rather than merely through the intellect).</p>

<h5><b>Material objects in the service of spiritual growth: Frari Church, Venice.</b></h5>
<p>The importance of material things was, for centuries, at the core of Christianity, which proposed that Jesus was both the highest spiritual being, <em>and</em> a flesh and blood person: he was the spirit incarnate; holiness em<em>bodied</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8679" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes.jpg?resize=635%2C400" alt="Última_Cena_-_Juan_de_Juanes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Jesus tells his followers about his theory of good materialism: transubstantiation:<strong> Vicente Masip &#8211; <i>The Last Supper</i> 1562</strong></h5>
<p>In the Catholic Mass, great significance is accorded to bread and wine, which are believed to be <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">transubstantiations</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Christ; that is, material objects which simultaneously have a spiritual identity, just as Jesus himself combined the spiritual and the bodily while on earth</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6-ap.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8680" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6-ap.jpg?resize=635%2C401" alt="Francis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This can sound like a very weird and arcane point entirely removed from the local shopping mall &#8211; but exactly the same concept actually applies outside of religions. Many</span> good material possession can be said to involve a kind of ‘transubstantiation’, whereby they are both practical and physical and also embody or allude to a positive personality or spirit.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BN2BKBKGB.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8681" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BN2BKBKGB.jpg?resize=338%2C338" alt="BN2BKBKGB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take this watch by the designer Dieter Rams. To the outer eye, it is an ordinary time-piece, but at a psychological level, it is also a kind of transubstantiation. It tells the time, while subtly hinting at more psychological or even spiritual ideals of purity, simplicity and harmony. It tells us how long there is till lunch, while gently trying to nudge us towards being a certain sort of person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or take this chair.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8682" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/image00.jpg?resize=359%2C478" alt="Directoire style chair with wicker seat" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It too ‘transubstantiates’ a set of important values: straightforwardness, strength, honesty and elegance. By getting closer to the chair, we stand to become a little more like it, which is an important piece of inner evolution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Material objects can therefore be said to play a positive psychological (or spiritual) role in our lives when higher more positive ideals are ‘materialised’ in them, and so when buying and using them daily gives us a chance to get closer to our better selves. When they are contained in physical things, valuable psychological qualities that are otherwise often intermittent in our thoughts and conduct can become more stable and resilient.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/h2/h2_91.1.226.jpg?resize=372%2C303" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is not to say that all consumerism just conveniently turns out to be great. It depends on what a given material object stands for. An object can transubstantiate the very worst sides of human nature &#8211; greed, callousness, the desire to triumph &#8211; as much as it can the best. So we must be careful not to decry or celebrate all material consumption: we have to ensure that the objects we invest in, and tire ourselves and the planet by making, are those that lend most encouragement to our higher, better natures.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don’t think we hate cheap things &#8211; but we frequently behave as if we rather do. Consider the pineapple. Columbus was the first European to be delighted by the physical grandeur and vibrant sweetness of the pineapple &#8211; which is a native of South America but had reached the Caribbean by the time he arrived there. The first meeting between Europeans and pineapples took place in November 1493, in a Carib village on the island of Guadaloupe. Columbus’s crew spotted the fruit next to a pot of stewing human limbs. The outside reminded them of a pine cone, the interior pulp of an apple.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But pineapples proved extremely difficult to transport and very costly to cultivate. For a long time only royalty could actually afford to eat them: Russia’s Catherine the Great was a huge fan as was Charles II of England. A single fruit in the 17th century sold for today’s equivalent of GBP 5000. The pineapple was such a status symbol that, if they could get hold of one, people would keep it for display until it fell apart. In the mid-eighteenth century, at the height of the pineapple craze, whole aristocratic evenings were structured around the ritual display of these fruits. Poems were written in their honour. Savouring a tiny sliver could be the high point of a year.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles-pineapple.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8426" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles-pineapple.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="Charles-pineapple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>Charles II being offered the first pineapple ever successfully grown in England, by the royal gardener, John Rose (1675)</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pineapple was so exciting and so loved that in 1761, the 4th earl of Dunmore built a temple on his Scottish estate in its honour:  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pineapple-450.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8428" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pineapple-450.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="pineapple-450" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Christopher Wren had no hesitation in topping the South Tower of St Paul’s with this evidently divine fruit.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/st-pauls-pineapple1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8433" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/st-pauls-pineapple1.jpg?resize=398%2C530" alt="st-pauls-pineapple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>South Tower of St Paul’s Cathedral, Christopher Wren, 1711</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then at the very end of the 19th century, two things changed. Large commercial plantations of pineapples were established in Hawaii and there were huge advances in steam-ship technology; production and transport costs plummeted and, unwittingly, transformed the psychology of pineapple-eating. Today, you can get a pineapple for around GBP 1.50. </span></p>
<p>It still tastes exactly the same. But now, the pineapple is one of the world’s least glamorous fruits. It is never served at smart dinner parties and it would never be carved on the top of a major civic building.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image15.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8435" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image15.png?resize=635%2C510" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pineapple itself has not changed; only our attitude to it has. Contemplation of the history of the pineapple suggests a curious overlap between love and economics: when we have to pay a lot for something nice, we appreciate it to the full. Yet as its price in the market falls, passion has a habit of fading away. Naturally, if the object has no merit to begin with, a high price won’t be able to do anything for it; but if it has real virtue and yet a low price, then it is in severe danger of falling into grievous neglect.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a pattern that we see recurring in a range of areas. For example, with the sight of clouds from above. In 1927, a hitherto unknown air mail pilot called Charles Lindbergh became the first man to complete a solo crossing of the Atlantic in his fragile plane, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Spirit of St Louis</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8437" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image24.png?resize=635%2C582" alt="image24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For hours, he flew in the most arduous conditions, braving wind, rain and storms. He saw clouds passing below him and distant thunder claps on the horizon. It was one of the profoundest moments of his life. He was awestruck and felt he was becoming, for a time, almost God-like. For most of the twentieth century, his experience remained rare and extremely costly. There was therefore never any danger that the human value of crossing an ocean by air would be overlooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This lasted until the arrival of the Boeing 747 and the cheap plane ticket in the summer of 1970. The jumbo fundamentally changed the economics of flying. The experiences of gazing down at clouds and seeing the world spread out stopped being (as it had been for Lindbergh) a life-changing encounter; it started to feel commonplace and even a little boring. It became peculiar to wax lyrical about the red-eye to JFK or a mention of a spectacular column of clouds that one had spotted shortly after the arrival of the chicken lunch. A trip that would have mesmerised Leonardo da Vinci or John Constable was now passed over in silence. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8439" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image04.png?resize=635%2C410" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The view from the plane window underwent an economic miracle that led to a psychological catastrophe: its cost dropped and it ceased to matter, though its real value hadn’t changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or think of the bath. For centuries, having a hot bath all to yourself at home was a remarkable, highly prized experience out of reach to all except a very few at the pinnacle of society. It ideally required the assistance of several assistants to heat the water and fill the tub, fend of draughts, hold the towels and proffer the soap. It was a special occasion &#8211; like a coronation or a victory in battle &#8211; worthy of being recorded in a grand work of art. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8441" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001.jpg?resize=635%2C592" alt="Jean-Baptiste_Pater_001" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It would be an experience to ponder and remember, to reflect upon and discuss with your friends. One would dwell for days on the wonder of immersing the body in a warm, buoyant liquid.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But improvements in plumbing and water supply, in energy supply, expansion in the size of the average dwelling space per inhabitant and the introduction of less expensive tubs have made the bath an ordinary experience. It doesn’t feel as if there is anything at all special about it. In fact, it’s maybe all just a bit too slow: one has a shower instead. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PM-100314-bathA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8443" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/PM-100314-bathA.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="PM-100314-bathA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pattern is the same: the reduction in the way we esteem the experience follows on the heels of a reduction on the cost of obtaining it. There’s a similar parallel history for light in the evening (highly prized in the age of candles, boring in the age of the halogen bulb) or for freshly laundered clothes &#8211; an astonishing, unusual phenomenon for long ages; but now the clean cotton T-shirt (which would have so deeply impressed Charlemagne or Louis XVI) isn’t worth noticing. </span></p>
<p>Why, then, do we associate cheap prices with a lack of value? Our response is a hang-over from our long pre-industrial past. For most of human history, there truly was a strong correlation between cost and value: the higher the price, the better things tended to be &#8211; because there was simply no way both for prices to be low and quality to be high. Everything had to be made by hand, by expensively trained artisans, with raw materials that were immensely difficult to transport. The expensive sword, jacket, window or wheelbarrow were simply always the better ones. This relationship between price and value held true in an uninterrupted way until the end of the 18th century, when &#8211; thanks to the Industrial Revolution &#8211; something extremely unusual happened: human beings worked out how to make high quality goods at cheap prices, because of technology and new methods of organising the labour force.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you live in a craft-based society, the quality of any object invariably depends upon how much skilled labour went into producing it. In the 15th century, swords and helmets made by the Missaglias family in Milan were especially pricey. But that was because they were especially skilled, and produced armour that was stronger, lighter, better balanced and more cleverly designed than anyone else. It was a general principle: a more expensive cloak would be more durable, warmer and more elegantly decorated than a cheaper version. A more expensive window would let in more light, keep out more draughts, open more easily, and last in good condition much longer than its less expensive rivals: it would be a more skilfully made product constructed from more durable materials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back of this long experience, an entrenched cultural association has formed between the rare, the expensive and the good: each has come to rapidly suggest the other, and the natural-seeming converse is that things which are widely available and inexpensive come to be seen as unimpressive or unexciting. </span></p>

<h5>Sallet and armor by Antonio Missaglia, 1450</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In principle, industrialisation was supposed to undo these connections. The price would fall and widespread happiness would follow. High quality objects would enter the mass market, excellence would be democratised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This promised to be an exciting moment and evangelists regularly proclaimed a new age, where universal political suffrage would be accompanied by material dignity and honour for every social class. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1911, Henry Ford started developing the car assembly line, which replaced the slower individual skilled worker. The price of cars came down quickly so that it became possible for ordinary workers to afford cars themselves. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The designers of the Bauhaus movement in 1920s Germany were similarly fired up in their work by the idea of creating household items that would be both highly attractive and very cheap, available to anyone on even the most modest of salaries.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8450" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image05.png?resize=635%2C424" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>The promise of modernity: Nice chairs, desks, lamps and rugs for everyone</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, despite the greatness of these efforts, instead of making wonderful experiences universally available, industrialisation has inadvertently produced a different effect: it has seemed to rob certain experiences of their loveliness, interest and worth. </span></p>
<p>It’s not &#8211; of course &#8211; that we refuse to buy inexpensive or cheap things. It’s just that getting excited over cheap things has come to seem a little bizarre. One is allowed to get very worked up over the eggs of the sturgeon (£100 for a small pot); but have to be very circumscribed about one’s enthusiasm for the eggs of a chicken (12 for £2). There is an intimidating hierarchy operating in the background, shaping what we are grateful for and feel that we lack and must have.</p>
<div class="image_sidebyside size-full">
                         </p>

<h5><b>The price tells us: something very special is going on here. But it may be going on in the cheaper thing too&#8230;</b></h5>
<p>
                         <div class="clear-both"></div>
                     </div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tragedy for our relationship to money is that the hierarchy operates in favour of the expensive things, which means that very often we end up feeling that we can’t afford good things and that our lives are therefore sad and fatefully incomplete. The money hierarchy is constantly making us feel impoverished, while the hidden truth is that there are in fact more good things within our grasp than we believe (and tend to notice only when we are dying or recovering from a bad illness). We are rich enough to purchase the superlative egg of the chicken; but we don’t experience our wealth here; we are left lamenting our inability to buy the hugely expensive (but not actually much nicer) egg of the almost infertile and evasive Iranian sturgeon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we reverse this? The answer lies in a slightly unexpected area: the mind of a four-year-old. Here he is with a puddle. It started raining an hour ago, now the street is full of puddles, and there could be nothing better in the world; the riches of the Indies would be nothing next to the pleasures of being able to see the rippling of the water created by a jump in one’s Wellingtons, the eddies and whirlpools, the minute waves, the oceans beneath one&#8230;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8459" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image07.png?resize=635%2C391" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children have two advantages: they don’t know what they’re supposed to like &#8211; and they don’t understand money &#8211; so price is never a guide of value for them. They have to rely instead on their own delight (or lack of it) in the intrinsic merits of the things they’re presented with, and this can take them in astonishing (and sometimes maddening) directions. They’ll spend an hour with one button. One buys them the £49 wooden toy made by Swedish artisans who hope to teach lessons in symmetry and finds that they prefer the cardboard box that it came in. They become mesmerised by the wonders of turning on the light and therefore think it sensible to try it 100 times. They’d prefer the nail and screw section of a DIY shop to the fanciest toy department (or the national museum).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This attitude allows them to be entranced by objects which have long ago ceased to hold our wonder. If asked to put a price on things, children tend to answer by the utility and charm of an object, not its manufacturing costs. This leads to unusual but &#8211; we recognise &#8211; more rightful results. A child might guess that a stapler costs a hundred pounds and would be deeply surprised, even shocked, to learn that the USB stick can be had for just over one pound. Children would be right, if prices were determined by human worth and value, but they’re not; they just reflect what things cost to make. The pity is, therefore, that we treat them as a guide to what matters, when this isn’t what a financial price should ever be used for.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image17.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8460" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image17.png?resize=635%2C385" alt="image17" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>An object worthy of immense wonder: now ignored</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But at a certain age, something very debilitating happens to children (normally around the age of eight). They start to learn about ‘expensive’ and ‘cheap’ and absorb the view that the more expensive something is, the better it may be. They are encouraged to think well of saving up pocket money and to see the ‘big’ toy they are given as much better than the ‘cheaper’ one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t directly go backwards, we can’t forget what we know of prices. However, we can pay less attention to what things cost and more to our own responses. The people who have most to teach us here are artists. They are the experts at recording and communicating their enthusiasms which, like children, can take them in slightly unexpected directions. The French artist Paul Cézanne spent a good deal of the late nineteenth century painting groups of apples in his studio in Provence. He was thrilled by their texture, shapes and colours. He loved the transitions between the yellowy golds and the deep reds across their skins. He was an expert at noticing how the generic word ‘apple’ in fact covers an infinity of highly individual examples. Under his gaze, each one becomes its own planet, a veritable universe of distinctive colour and aura &#8211; and hence a source of real delight and solace. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image06.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8463" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image06.png?resize=635%2C291" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The apple that has only a limited life, that will make a slow transition from sweetness to sour, that grew patiently on a particular tree, that survived the curiosity of birds and spiders, that weathered the mistral and a particularly blustery May is honoured and properly given its due by the artist (who was himself extremely wealthy, the heir of an enormous banking fortune: it seems important to state this, just to make sure that Cézanne wasn’t just making a virtue of necessity and would have worshipped gold bullion if he’d had the chance. He did; and he didn’t). Cézanne had all the awe, love and excitement before the apple that Catherine the Great and Charles II had before the pineapple: but Cézanne’s wonderful discovery was that these elevated and powerful emotions are just as valid in relation to things which can be purchased for the small change in our pockets. Cézanne in his studio was generating his own revolution, not an industrial revolution that would make once costly objects available to everyone, but a Revolution in Appreciation, a far deeper process, that would get us to notice what we already have to hand. Instead of reducing prices, he is raising levels of appreciation; which is a move that is perhaps more precious to us economically &#8211; because it means that we can suddenly get a lot more great things for very little money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of what we find ‘moving’ in an encounter with the apples is that we’re restored to a familiar but forgotten attitude of appreciation, that we surely once knew in childhood when we loved the toggles on our rain jackets and found a paperclip a source of fascination and didn’t know what anything cost. Since then, life has pushed us into the world of money where prices loom too large, we now acknowledge, in our relation to things. While we enjoy Cézanne’s work, it might also unexpectedly make us feel a little sad: the sadness is a recognition of how many of our genuine enthusiasms and loves we’ve had to surrender in the name of the adult world. We’ve perhaps given up on too many of our native loves. The apple is one instance of a whole continent we’ve ceased to marvel at.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8467" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="still-life-with-bottle-and-apple-basket-1894" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a commercial version of Cézanne’s work and we call it advertising. Like Cézanne’s work, advertising throws the best things about objects into relief and tells us in insistent and urgently enthusiastic and sensitive ways what is loveable about bits of the world. Advertising is skilled, for example, at pointing out the loveable things in the new top of the range BMW, the cylinders, the leather seat surrounds, the moulding around the wheel arches (lithe and muscular) and of course the army of lights, skilfully massing their beams ready to attack the darkness on the road ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only problem with advertising is that it isn’t done for enough things, or indeed the things that would be most helpful and convenient for us to appreciate. People who attack advertising get it slightly wrong: the problem is not that we love BMWs, but that so much of our love and awe has been syphoned in that direction and hasn’t been properly excited in other, more realistic areas.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8470" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image02.png?resize=635%2C448" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need an advertising pursued with the same sense of drama and intensity and ambition but directed towards biros, puddles and olives. The reason this doesn’t happen isn’t sinister or profound. It’s just we haven’t yet found a way to pay the enormous sums required to glamorise objects through advertising in the case of lower priced items.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image22.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8472" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image22.png?resize=635%2C404" alt="image22" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><b>He needs a campaign for himself</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our reluctance to be excited by inexpensive things isn’t a fixed debility of human nature. It’s just a current cultural misfortune. We all naturally used to know the solution as children. The ingredients of the solution are intrinsically familiar. We get hints of what should happen in the art gallery and in front of adverts. We need to rethink our relationship to prices. The price of something is principally determined by what it cost to make, not how much human value is potentially to be derived from it. We have been looking at prices in the wrong way: we have fetishised them as tokens of intrinsic value, we have allowed them to set how much excitement we are allowed to have in given areas, how much joy is to be mined in particular places. But prices were never meant to be like this: we are breathing too much life into them, and therefore dulling too many of our responses to the inexpensive world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two ways to get richer: one is to make more money; and the second is to discover that more of the things we could love are already to hand (thanks to the miracles of the Industrial Revolution). We are, astonishingly, already a good deal richer than we are encouraged to think we are.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite the widespread availability of good quality cheap products (watches, handbags, cars…), there remains a remarkable appetite for extremely expensive versions of them &#8211; which seems deeply weird at first sight. The so-called luxury sector appears to defy economic logic.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image14.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8481" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image14.png?resize=500%2C407" alt="image14" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image11.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8482" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image11.png?resize=500%2C557" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These two timepieces do very much the same thing. Both can tell you barometric pressure at 1,000 feet below the surface of the sea; both will be able to time a 100 meter race down to split second accuracy; both can accommodate leap years with ease; and both are elegantly styled in sensuous steel alloys. But a key difference is that one costs £100, and the other £20,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the immediate question is: why would someone spend two hundred times more on a watch? The standard response at this point is to get rather severe, judgmental and censorious; and to assume that the only reason one might buy the expensive item is the desire to show off, to parade one’s affluence and to try to humiliate others. In short, buying it is a piece of aggressive self-assertion. This sort of analysis derives from our society’s folk memory of a stock character in fiction &#8211; the mean rich idiot &#8211; whom we know from Rabelais and Dickens, Thackeray and Amis. The names may keep changing but the character is the same.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image.jpg?resize=635%2C338" alt="image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Nick Frost as John Self in a 2010 BBC adaptation of Amis&#8217;s <em>Money.</em></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet the key to human progress isn’t how energetically we denounce things, but how perceptively we come to understand the inner workings of troubling behaviour (whether it be shoplifting, bulimia or buying a Rolex). As we have arduously managed to get better accounts of the origins of crime (and therefore come to deal with it more adroitly), a similar move awaits in the area of luxury goods. We’re facing a pathology which needs to be treated with kindness and insight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This issue needs to be addressed urgently because it’s remarkably stressful to live in a society where luxury seems like a necessary route to a good life. The implicit philosophy of luxury goods is that the ingredients of fulfilment lie considerably outside an ordinary salary; which condemns a huge section of society to feelings of incompleteness. By definition ‘luxury’ is what 95% of the population either cannot, or can only just (with huge effort) afford. So there’s a genuine need to attack the brilliance with which luxury has managed to position itself as both central to life &#8211; yet unavailable. Luxury has a menacing, baffling position in relation to our ambitions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we can suggest that the impulse to buy luxury goods doesn’t come from greed or the desire to humiliate others. It springs from two motives. The first is fear; fear of most other people. The love of luxury breeds in societies where it feels very dangerous to be average, like 18th-century France or contemporary India or China. It isn’t coincidental that the love of luxury has been particularly in evidence in societies where the average existence is a properly painful place to be. It may be easy for us to dismiss as ‘superfluous’ the layers of gold, the cherubs, the diamonds and sculpted reliefs; but these can seem like very necessary tokens of separation between the owner and a genuinely squalid world beyond. They are forms of protection against the terror of an average life, in societies where average means appalling.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image08.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8484" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image08.png?resize=400%2C359" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Napoleonic_Fabergé_egg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8485" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Napoleonic_Fabergé_egg.jpg?resize=400%2C516" alt="DSC_0069" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The taste for luxury isn’t just defined by the trajectory of nations, it is also defined by a person’s place within a society. It shouldn’t surprise us that a taste relatively close to that found at Versailles should also thrive in some south London housing estates. The motives are the same: it is a desire to show that one is ‘different’, when being the same means to be very short of dignity and respect.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8486" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/image19.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also shouldn’t surprise us that certain places are rather inimical to luxury, that Rolex and Louis Vuitton, Prada and Aston Martin have done spectacularly badly in Denmark, a country which boasts the third highest level per capita income in the world and one of the most equal distributions of wealth anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Danish case illustrates one large possible solution to the social problem of luxury. The desire for luxury is inversely related to the level of dignity of an average life; as dignity goes up, so the desire for luxury comes down. It was never really about greed, the love of luxury was an individual response to a political failure: the inability of governments to ensure that an average life could be a flourishing life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8487" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="2947500661_2fea0ddc1c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But politics may take a very long time to solve this issue and while we wait, there’s another major move to undercut the debilitating need for luxury. Politics wants to change ordinary life; but another strategy is to re-evaluate ordinary life, to see the hidden worth beneath apparently unimpressive things and people. This is the move that has, traditionally, been made by certain religions, Christianity and Buddhism in particular. Both these disciplines upgrade the average, they insist that very important things are going on in humble vessels. They deny that outward show is the sign of value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In John Everett Millais’s 1850 painting &#8211; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Christ in the House of his Parents</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the central, most esteemed figure of Christianity, Jesus himself, is shown in his everyday surroundings. It is emphatically an ‘ordinary’ place that the King of Kings inhabits. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_The_Carpenters_Shop_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8478" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_The_Carpenters_Shop_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="1024px-John_Everett_Millais_-_Christ_in_the_House_of_His_Parents_(&#96;The_Carpenter's_Shop')_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millais has carefully portrayed the messy earthen floor, the bare walls, the homespun clothes, the lack of shoes; the absence of any of the period equivalent of luxury brands. But at the same time he’s asking us to see this unglamorous scene as hugely important. The most esteemed things in the world are going on here &#8211; only without much external show. It’s a message Christianity was trying to teach in many ways: the ordinary isn’t really ordinary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t have to be officially religious, or even that sympathetic to many of the tenets of the faiths, to see the worth of this move. It’s one that has developed an independent life; we see it in the visual arts without any superstitious underpinnings, for example, in the work of the Danish painter, Christen Kobke, who stokes our enthusiasm for unpretentious calm evenings by the lake shore. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8479" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="Christen_Købke_-_A_View_from_Dosseringen_near_the_Sortedam_Lake_Looking_towards_the_Suburb_Nørrebro_outside_Copenhage..._-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That we should be drawn to luxury isn&#8217;t just a fear of the average, it’s also a symptom of trust in authority, driven to a potentially excessive degree. Trust in authority is frequently a very good thing. It&#8217;s what gets us through school, allows us to drive cars safely in busy cities, means we will queue willingly at airports and follow the instructions of a fire officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied to culture, trust in authority has been useful in directing us to some great works: it is what advised us to pay attention to the paintings of Rothko and the novels W.G. Sebald (neither of which we might, left to ourselves, have encountered or persisted with). </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8480" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/No_61_Mark_Rothko.jpg?resize=480%2C600" alt="No_61_Mark_Rothko" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><b>Trust in cultural authority got us to be notice this.</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this trust can be usurped by the less deserving characters from ad agencies, who act a little like a malevolent supply teacher who work on a student’s credulity, exploiting his trust in authority, built up over years by a series of benign teachers. </span>Our willingness to do what we’re assured is the right thing gets us into trouble when it’s hijacked by people who don’t really have our best interests at heart.</p>

<p>Our love of luxury goods isn’t freakish or vainglorious. It is attuned to some genuine needs: the need not to be drawn into a degraded average existence and to follow the prestigious voices of authority, speaking to us from billboards and magazines. These goods will continue to hold a central place until we find better solutions to the problems in our natures and in our societies that they so adroitly feed upon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most of what we call ‘politics’ really revolves around the question of what you need to do to make a country richer.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than ask this of any specific country, let’s imagine designing a country from scratch. How could you make it as rich as possible? Suppose the brief was to design ‘Richland’: an ideal wealth-creating society. What would be the chief characteristics you’d need to build into this society? What would a nation look like that was ideally suited to success in modern capitalism?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8056" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="13855803075_2d0c8b59b0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditional economics guides us to eight core requirements for Richland:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– military security &amp; law and order</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– lack of corruption in institutions</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– low amounts of red-tape around employment legislation and taxation</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a technically well-educated, mobile, flexible labour-force</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– high-grade infrastructure and good telecommunications</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– fair, transparent and competitive markets</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– reliably enforceable contracts</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– low corporation tax (between 10 and 15%)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But aside from these eight, there is one other thing that invariably makes a critical difference to the wealth of societies: what we might call cultural factors. To make Richland properly rich, you’d need to ensure that a number of cultural factors were embedded in the national mentality. Here are some of these wealth-inducing attitudes:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">WORK DEFINES WHO YOU ARE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, at parties, the first thing people want to know is: what do you do? According to how you answer, people are either delighted to see you, or swiftly abandon you by the peanuts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/543642045_0464ec8832_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8057" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/543642045_0464ec8832_o.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="543642045_0464ec8832_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Seite-3</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, what is on your business card is simply who you are. All the other stuff &#8211; what you were like as a child, what you think of late at night, who your parents are &#8211; doesn’t really matter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, friendships are usually linked to work and involve covert status rivalries. If you fall behind, your friends might drop you. You have to invest an enormous amount of effort in your career, not merely to make money, but so you can have a functioning social identity: so that people will be nice to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LOVE IS EXTRINSIC, NOT INTRINSIC</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, parents place a tremendous emphasis on educational achievements. Children come away feeling not just that it’s nice to do well in exams,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but that they are more loveable human beings, more worthy of existence, if they triumph at school, especially in maths and science.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/16241388115_fec39f427a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8061" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/16241388115_fec39f427a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="16241388115_fec39f427a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Chris &amp; Karen Highland</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You therefore learn early on that love comes from successful performance: the more you achieve, the kinder people will be to you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OPTIMISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, everyone is encouraged from a young age to imagine that they might one day &#8211; perhaps by 33 &#8211; be the richest person in the country &#8211; if they work hard. Posters of rich and famous people adorn the walls of primary schools. The national anthem is called ‘I can do it!’ &#8211; an ecstatic rendition of human possibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/522695099_026b8d7ffe_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8059" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/522695099_026b8d7ffe_z.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="522695099_026b8d7ffe_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Joi Ito</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This keeps the workforce highly motivated. Dreams of successful entrepreneurship abound. But by middle age, most people in Richland have by definition failed to measure up to the exalted hopes once placed in them. They keep their regrets hidden, however &#8211; and are quietly prescribed tranquilizers and antidepressants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">EVERYONE IS ANXIOUS ALL THE TIME</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People don’t sleep very well in Richland. They’re often up at 4 am. Their worries all relate to their careers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5960469024_ba617aa78c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8060" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5960469024_ba617aa78c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5960469024_ba617aa78c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because market capitalism in Richland is very ‘efficient’. Efficiency means constant innovation and rivalry: the weaker players in any field are always driven out of business swiftly and without mercy. The stock market is ruthless about punishing underperformance (normally on a quarterly basis). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE CONSUMER IS KING</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, everything is geared towards the needs of the consumer: there must be low prices, there has to be excellent customer service, shops have to be open at all hours. There can be no sacrosanct high holidays or weekends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2680078880_d883433f98_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8062" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2680078880_d883433f98_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2680078880_d883433f98_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Andy Wilson</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even though most people are both consumers and producers, in Richland, they are taught to think of themselves primarily as consumers. In their minds, their multiple woes as producers are carefully disassociated from the scale of their expectations as consumers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE NEWS IS ALWAYS TERRIFYING</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is ‘news’ everywhere in Richland &#8211; on websites, phones and 24 hour channels &#8211; and it’s always catastrophic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3004665693_c32ab495a6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8063" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3004665693_c32ab495a6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3004665693_c32ab495a6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/caruba</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Citizens thereby learn that the world is incredibly unsafe and that terror, accident and cruelty await at every turn. There is utter silence about anything positive. Every encounter with the media leaves one suspecting that the only way to protect oneself is through the accumulation of ever larger sums of money. People take out a lot of insurance in Richland, a gift the news industry unwittingly hands to insurance brokers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SPARE TIME</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, people don’t take many holidays. Generally, they are very self-denying and scared about what might happen if they don’t remain in the office long enough. They get up early, are suspicious of any kind of indulgence and have sandwiches at their desks for lunch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2581218229_53331b00b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8064" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2581218229_53331b00b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="2581218229_53331b00b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Alan Cleaver</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other hand they are very interested in paying a lot for what they call ‘fun’. They pay a significant premium to have a car that can go at twice the legal speed-limit and for flying far away on holiday many times a year. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Activities that don’t cost much &#8211; like going for long walks round the local neighbourhood or writing poetry &#8211; are seen as unimpressive, slightly eccentric things. Though many of Richland’s psychologists speak of the benefit of parents spending time with their small children, most children are brought up by staff from low-wage countries while their parents go to work. This lack of secure attachment does wonders for the children in turn: they grow up anxious, eager to please and desperate to attain security through work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FASHION RULES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, there are powerful currents of fashion around most things: what thickness your TV screen has, what kind of ethnicity of food you eat, what models of phone you talk on. People can get rapidly dissatisfied with their current possessions and quickly excited by new products. It feels very important to be up to date. It is a serious blow to one’s self-esteem to feel that one is missing a trend. You can get into trouble if your phone is more than three years old. People speak highly of thinking for yourself, but sheep-like behaviour is far better for the shops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CELEBRITIES SPARKLE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every society has famous people in it. But Richland is very selective about its heroes: it doesn’t revere contemplative monks, wise sages or philosophers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6808408671_de92a259aa_b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8066" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6808408671_de92a259aa_b1.jpg?resize=462%2C667" alt="6808408671_de92a259aa_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Jasmine Kaloudis</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Glamour is monopolised by wealth creators, especially ones in film. Their doings are constantly reported on so that the lives of most ordinary people seem squalid and awful by comparison. News of the famous means that people try much, much harder to work and improve their apparently miserable lot. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">MERITOCRACY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Richland is seen as a very ‘fair’ place. If you work hard and are clever, you’ll get there. There’s no nepotism or insider trading. The playing field is level.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8072" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8719935889_bb99a5f2c2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/UK Parliament</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s a lovely philosophy for the winners, but more punitive for those who get left behind. They are termed ‘losers’ and are judged personally responsible for their own shortcomings. It’s a culture that is very hostile to the idea of luck. You are the author of your own fate. If things go wrong, don’t blame anyone else. There’s a very high suicide rate in Richland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LITTLE RELIGION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Richland, there’s no religion that energetically promotes spiritual goods and sees kindness and wisdom as superior to wealth and power. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In general, people are secular and mock the religious. But in so far as some people do believe, the God they believe in is remarkably materialistic: it’s a chap in the sky who believes in rewarding those who are good with dollops of money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">BAD WEATHER</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Richland has very bad weather. It combines the worst of England and the Netherlands:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>brief, mild, unreliable summers with only around seven cloudless days in it and with the temperature rarely getting into the 20s. Then come long endless dark winters with gusty, icy winds and low heavy cloud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/17970662609_8c682a23b1_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8067" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/17970662609_8c682a23b1_k.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="17970662609_8c682a23b1_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Picturepest</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, the natural world delivers a constant reminder that delight is never freely and bountifully provided by nature; good things don’t grow on trees, only unremitting human industry can provide salvation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The citizens of Richland can certainly be envied for their wealth: their shopping malls are extraordinary and the restaurants are truly superlative. But they also have to be a little pitied for some of their 4am anxieties; for their relentless doubts about their careers and for the worry that no one can really like them outside of what they have managed to achieve this quarter.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Advertising has made a very bad name for itself. We don&#8217;t trust it or want much of it around so it has resorted to springing up on us in unexpected places.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- by the side of the road </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- at a football match </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- at the airport jetway </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3253842434_b84d76ab72_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7659" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3253842434_b84d76ab72_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3253842434_b84d76ab72_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relationship between consumer and advertiser has become like a game of nagging and pestering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The advertiser feels the consumer doesn&#8217;t really want what&#8217;s on offer, but assumes that if it just keeps popping up all the time (and perhaps cracks a joke or gets half undressed), eventually the consumer will give up and buy the damned toothbrush, chocolate bar or insurance policy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering people can feel like a natural strategy for advertisers to fall back on when striving to gain our attention. After all, this is what we all did when we were very young and had no other options. A six-year-old has no capacity to rationally persuade her parents to buy her a goldfish but she will instinctively assume that asking a million times might just work (and, occasionally, it does). When we’re stressed to keep our jobs at the agency, we may return easily to such early badgering instincts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lamentable thing is that a badgering approach is unnecessary, because it isn&#8217;t as if most of us don&#8217;t want to buy things and have no material needs. We&#8217;re constantly wanting to shop. The act of buying isn&#8217;t something foisted upon us by an evil advertising industry &#8211; as people in advertising seem somehow to believe in their hearts. It&#8217;s something we naturally and spontaneously feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/38623561_adb17e6124_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7661" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/38623561_adb17e6124_z.jpg?resize=635%2C408" alt="38623561_adb17e6124_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at present, there&#8217;s simply no incentive for us to tell advertisers about what we might need because we don&#8217;t trust them not to keep bugging us if ever we were to reveal more about ourselves. They&#8217;ve annoyed us far too much already for us to let on about our interests. We don&#8217;t want to tell them that we&#8217;re potentially in the market for a new car and wouldn&#8217;t mind being shown some options for a nice woollen jacket. We&#8217;d never share such private information because we suspect how it might then all go: we&#8217;d be bothered ad nauseam, possibly for decades; we wouldn&#8217;t be presented with the real range of options and our details would be passed on to other firms selling utterly off-beat things, like inflatable dinghies and lunch boxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So instead, we just lie low and remain deeply guarded about sharing anything about our lives &#8211; which is what, in turn, leads advertisers to bully us and spy on us, to track our online moves and, when they&#8217;re really fed up and desperate, to bung up our computers with pop ups.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/fa9b534892464058aea0242965e04401/200586432/pop-ups.jpg?resize=630%2C404" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relationship between customer and advertiser has wound up being marked by a total lack of trust on both sides. Customers don&#8217;t trust that advertisers will look after their real needs. And advertisers don&#8217;t trust that customers will listen to an honest pitch.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However sad the situation, it does hint at the shape of an eventual answer. If advertisers became more responsible, and could be trusted not to foist random things on us, then we would tell them about ourselves and our needs, perhaps quite a lot. The more we thought well of them, the more details we&#8217;d reveal &#8211; as we might to a friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we only become friends with people we can trust; and that to date, doesn&#8217;t encompass the advertising industry. If these people want to earn our time and sincere attention, then they need to stop tracking us with cookies and trying to show up with hardly any clothes on in weird places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-vCAlGgAbq3s/U5Mjoo3TS5I/AAAAAAAAAP4/1rlBgVrljJI/s1600/f67c99de2af5af20e4db8d5b0c46d7c7.jpg?resize=623%2C390" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Advertisers need to behave with the sort of dignity and self-respect of people who know they could properly improve the lives of others once they got to know them well. Then we might willingly start to listen and tell them about ourselves.</p>
<p class="p1">

<p>We&#8217;ve grown used to belittling things that don&#8217;t happen to be important to us right now with the powerful term, &#8216;first world problem&#8217;. This kind of tough-minded response is understandable but a bit counterproductive. Just because an issue isn&#8217;t connected to life or death, doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t cause genuine pain or isn&#8217;t worth thinking about. A problem can be important without being life-threatening. Moreover, we should be excited by trying to solve the most advanced problems out there.</p>

<p>We are likely to have grown up thinking that the mainstream media was our friend. The common sense, natural judge of everything that matters and is important and a reliable guide to existence. So why, after spending so long with it, are we generally so overloaded, confused and oddly unfocused on the stuff that really matters?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our societies are guided by a discipline that we can still usefully refer to as Classical Economics. Classical Economics looks at the workings of supply and demand with a deliberate avoidance of evaluation. The economist today is expected to display no judgements about the worth or dignity of any activity. The aim is to make economics a respectable science like physics. When Newton analysed the laws of motion he did not distinguish whether an object in flight was an assassin’s bullet or a rose petal caught up in a warm breeze at dusk. From the point of view of mechanics, the evil of an act or the beauty of a moment are irrelevant.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Devoted to a cult of neutrality, classical economics has lost sight of its grander – and truer –purpose, which is to enable us to lead good lives. This is the goal to which Good Economics returns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical Economics maintains an amoral neutrality in connection with four major areas of human activity:</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ONE: DEMAND</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Classical Economics considers all demand or consumption to be equal in principle and to vary only in the quantities of money involved. One society might have a huge demand for wrestling matches and spend 10 billion pounds a year attending them, but nothing on poetry. While another society spends the 10 billion on poetry, and nothing on wrestling. In Classical economic terms there’s no interesting difference. And it would considered entirely wrong for an economist to say one society was better than another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461842294.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5471" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461842294.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="NY Times Chairman And Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr Rings NYSE Closing Bell" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if next year, the wrestling society spends a record 11 billion, it is cause for praise: demand is growing, which is always good, irrespective of what it is actually demand for. The classic approach does not try to adjudicate what a person, or a society, should want to consume. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">TWO: WAGES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the classical view, wages and salaries are rightly determined by what the market will bear. The theory is neutral on the human worth or merit of any kind of activity. It does not ask to what extent wages and salaries reflect the genuine contribution a person makes to the well-being of others. It cannot lament that a primary school teacher, who is devoted to developing the confidence and curiosity of a child, is paid a tiny fraction of the remuneration received by someone who bets on currency exchanges all day. Work is regarded only with respect to its financial status. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THREE: PROFIT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Profit is, too, assessed only in terms of quantity. So long as one stays within the law, classical economics is neutral on the issue of how it is produced. To make profit from running a casino is no more or less admirable, no better or worse, than to make it by designing and constructing<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>beautiful streets of small houses. The crucial factor is the rate of return on capital (assuming comparable levels of risk). The theory would advocate moving funds out of the construction of attractive streets and into gambling if the rate of return is higher and the level of risk the same.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461640484.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5472" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461640484.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Goldman Sachs Post Drop In Quarterly Profits" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FOUR: GDP (National Wealth)</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classical view is neutral about GDP. A society as a whole is assumed to be doing well so long as GDP is growing irrespective of the kinds of activity that lead this to happen. People might be working endless hours, the beauty of the countryside might be despoiled, but all that counts is whether the financial numbers are going up; anything else is irrelevant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a depressing picture. But, collectively, we have struggled to replace it with a better one. And the reason is that we have broadly accepted the core classical assumption. Which is that we must not evaluate economic activity – whether consumption or production – in other than financial terms. We have become reluctant to mix money and morals. We have become exceedingly reluctant to ask whether an activity, or a product, or a demand, is good. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Principles of Good Economics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good Economics is the study of how demand, work, profit and wealth can be organised so as to promote individual and collective flourishing. Good Economics aims at the creation of a good society. That is, one which best serves the highest interests of humanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The term ‘good’ spooks us. Privately we tend to feel we know what we think is good, and yet we get deeply nervous when the discussion gets public. We are terrified that our idea of ‘good’ will be unconvincing, or even offensive, to someone else. We get suspicious about who will decide what is to count as good. And we frighten ourselves with historical horror stories of brutish dictators who thought they were the ones who knew. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These anxieties can be addressed. In a democratic, market-oriented society, there are no mechanisms for <em>imposing</em> ‘the good’. So, if we want a better kind of economy – and many people do – the approach obviously has to be via persuasion and encouragement and the verdict of popular opinion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The good’ is the goal of each person’s individual development: the longing for satisfying relationships, work to be proud of, a calm and focused mind. There is huge scope for progress in helping ourselves towards these things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ONE: GOOD DEMAND</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Good Economics is interested in discerning and promoting signs of Good Demand within an economy. Good Demand means the degree of consumer choice related to the higher needs of humanity, that is, needs connected to a flourishing life. A Good Demand index or figure would give policy makers and the public a handy tool with which to measure not just what people were spending overall, but also, how much of that spend was taking place in the better parts of the economy – guided by the better parts of the human spirit. It would, for example, measure the amount of money flowing into education rather than gambling.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/153851122.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5473" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/153851122.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="PHILIPPINES-HEALTH-HANDWASHING DAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When people condemn &#8216;consumerism&#8217;, it&#8217;s not all purchases they are upset about. It&#8217;s consumption that seems to promote the worst sides of our natures: addiction, violence, status consciousness etc. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would set itself the task of measuring how much of our consumption was in line with our better selves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Far from despairing that the concept of &#8216;better selves&#8217; could never be defined, Good Economics would be rightly ambitious about our ability to make progress in drawing up a moral scale. It would be in sympathy with philosophy&#8217;s noblest mission: defining the ingredients of a good life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">TWO: GOOD WAGES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would be interested in measuring the degree to which an economy sustained &#8216;Good wages&#8217;, that is, accorded high rewards to jobs with highly beneficial social impacts. Unlike Classical Economics, it would not be timid about attempting the huge task of defining what &#8216;beneficial social impacts&#8217; might be. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A Good Wage economy would not be one where everyone earned the same. It would be one where income differentials tracked and reflected differences in social impacts: where salaries were better aligned with overall public worth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">THREE: GOOD PROFIT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Classical Economics gives all legal profit equal standing. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether a profit is generated making novelty ring tones or new renal medicines.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would institute a measure of Good Profit, identifying how much of an economy or a company&#8217;s profit was broadly in line with milestones of human progress.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461777874.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5475" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461777874.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="Seaside Town Of Redcar A Marginal Seat In The  2015 Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">FOUR: GOOD ECONOMIC INDICATORS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Classical Economics suggests that pure increases in economic activity – of whatever kind – are always the best guides to collective improvement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Good Economics would get fussier about demand, wages and profit. It would always want to know not just whether there was &#8216;more&#8217;, but whether it was &#8216;better&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It would not shy away from the historic task of getting more focused about defining &#8216;better&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Economics is – at its most serious – a branch of philosophy. It shouldn&#8217;t just be the neutral study of &#8216;economic growth&#8217;. It should be the study of how growth can promote human flourishing: that, in a nutshell, is the task of the new field known as Good Economics.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/464855083.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5682" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/464855083.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="New York City Prepares For Super Bowl XLVIII" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Many people today instinctively recoil from the concept of a brand.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The word brand brings with it some disturbing associations: heartless commercialism, crushing uniformity, blandness, a dumbed-down experience&#8230; A brand can be seen as a cynical way of cashing in on what might once have been a good idea by stripping away whatever was originally quirky, authentic and brave – and churning out a standardised product. It’s the corporate antithesis of art. When anyone sells out, it’s a brand that buys their soul. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are plenty of bad brands around. So it’s understandable that blame gets attached to the underlying notion of a brand itself. It becomes tempting to suppose that, ideally, we would live in an unbranded world. In fact, the idea of a brand is a really important one. A good economy needs good brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Ngv_jacques-françois_Micaud_zuppiera_e_vassorio_porcellana_di_sèvres.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5670" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Ngv_jacques-françois_Micaud_zuppiera_e_vassorio_porcellana_di_sèvres.jpeg?resize=635%2C475" alt="640px-Ngv,_jacques-françois_Micaud,_zuppiera_e_vassorio,_porcellana_di_sèvres" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a brand was invented by philosophers and art historians – though at first they gave it a different name (which we’ll get to in a minute). In his lectures, <em>The Englishness of English Art</em> (1955), the architectural writer, Nikolaus </span>Pevsner, identified some common characteristics in a range of works of English art; he saw these in things like King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, an 18th-century soup bowl and the landscape drawings of John Piper.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John_Piper_Middle_Mill.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5671" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/John_Piper_Middle_Mill.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="John_Piper_Middle_Mill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wasn’t looking for a physical common factor. Instead he was seeking something far more illuminating: a shared psychology. Pevsner characterised it as: moderation, compromise, comfortable wastefulness, a sense of fair play, a tendency to brush awkward details under the carpet and a distrust of intellectual assertion. And &#8211; he argued &#8211; this same national character is to be found as much at work as in the attitude to queuing as in the national liking for short words. Pevsner was out to identify what he called the English ‘spirit’ (or, more technically and in German, the English <em>Geist</em>).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/466909705.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5686" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/466909705.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="London Underground Workers Participate In The first Of Two 48-Hour Strikes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pevsner was searching for the distinguishing common factor that holds together a range of products – in this case works of &#8216;art&#8217;. In other words, he was identifying a brand – in exactly the same way that it’s possible to define the BMW brand by finding the common factors that distinguish a certain way of making cars. It’s not so much the radiator, or a typical ratio of height to length so much as an attitude to life: confident, assertive, competitive… to start the list.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Essentially a brand is a constellation of qualities, it is a personality in the material realm. It presents a vision of life in a hugely condensed manner via physical objects and services. </span></p>
<p>What is for sale in a branded item is not really the watch or the shirt. What we really want to purchase is something more elusive yet more important: a sense of belonging, a vision of life, qualities of mind and character. It is this large meaning which the brand conveys.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bad associations around brand spring from the way that often this vision of life is a little fake, exaggerated or plain daft. Tommy Hilfiger projects a vision of existence in which group sports are central and self doubt has little glamour. That’s a pity. Consider, by contrast, how in the early part of the 20th century, Virginia Woolf and her family and friends created a brand – known today as Bloomsbury – that stressed the centrality of conversation, flowers, flowing garments and sexual experimentation – a brand where group sports and cheeriness had very little glamour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5673" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg?resize=635%2C382" alt="NPG Ax140432; Lady Ottoline Morrell; Maria Huxley (nÈe Nys); Lytton Strachey; Duncan Grant; Vanessa Bell (nÈe Stephen) by Unknown photographer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a brand doesn’t only symbolise a set of ideas. It makes these ideas reproducible and universal. Brands allow particular qualities to multiply across the world. We tend to be rather alive to the negative possibilities here. When a branded shop moves into a town, people are often unhappy – and they may have very good reasons. However, the true culprit is not the pure idea of repetition. What we tend actually to be objecting to is what is being repeated: what’s being standardised isn’t itself impressive or wonderful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/110830956.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5674" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/110830956.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="04/03/1994. ILLUST.: PIZZA HUT, LIVRAISON A DOMICILE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 16th century, the Italian architect, Andrea Palladio, worked out some basic designs for villas, churches and public buildings in the Classical style. He built the first version in the little town of Vicenza. But his ideas spread, they were branded and universalised. They were, over the centuries, taken up in France, in the UK, in Poland, Russia and especially in the US. Thomas Jefferson in particular bought into the Palladian brand – and his own house Monticello and the University of Virginia – are key examples of franchise architecture, just as much as is the design for a McDonald’s restaurant. The key issue isn’t free creativity versus the cold hand of the brand. Rather it’s between the good, wonderful inspiring brand (like Palladio) and the less impressive versions that tend to be a lot more familiar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Thomas_Jeffersons_Monticello.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5677" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Thomas_Jeffersons_Monticello.jpeg?resize=635%2C333" alt="640px-Thomas_Jefferson's_Monticello" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brands help to overcome the unreliability of individuals. The brand offers the template and the rules, so that you needn&#8217;t be a genius to bring about something of genius. Which is very good news because there are few geniuses around and we don’t want good things to have to depend on such a rare phenomenon. This idea has historically been put into practice by many great artists like Tintoretto and Rubens, who were in such demand that they could not possibly produce all the works their clients asked for. So they evolved a brand concept whereby a lot more works could be produced in exactly the same spirit – though not painted entirely, or even very much, by their own hands. They would teach assistants how to do certain parts like the sky or drapery and evolved recipes for composition. The master’s name would guarantee the quality of the object – but it would not necessarily have hovered too much over any particular canvas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A brand makes an idea more obvious to us, more memorable and more powerful in our lives. Everyone has certain brands of soap, toothpaste or household appliances burnt into their brains so deeply that they may be amongst the last things we can recall as our memories finally dissolve with age. But, brands don’t have to make trivia memorable. They can also help keep our minds on higher things. In 1775 Goethe published his first novel,<em> The Sorrows of the Young Werther</em>. It was a big hit and soon gave rise to a branded industry. There were Werther inns (the kind of establishment the character in the novel might have liked), Werther clothes (the hero was especially keen on white trousers) and Werther Eau de Cologne. These served to keep the ideas of the book – compelling reflections on the nature of love and the painful process of growing up – at the front of a lot more people’s minds.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most brands have logos. The logo is a visual cue that immediately focuses our minds on particular qualities that we can expect of the location or object that carries it. Again, logos come in for great criticism. They seem to be everywhere and to ruin the skyline.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166060151.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5679" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166060151.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="Inside Burger King And Subway As McDonald's Faces Growing Challenge From Rivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it isn’t the logo that’s the problem. Once again, it’s the underlying qualities the logo is representing. For many, the Christian lamb is a deeply cheering logo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eyck-lamb-passion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5680" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/eyck-lamb-passion.jpg?resize=635%2C347" alt="eyck-lamb-passion" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the aim shouldn’t be to eliminate brands. Instead, the big goal is to elevate the concept. We actually need – and hugely benefit from – good things being developed as brands. We need more good things to shift from being cottage industries to being global brands. For example, it is a great pity that the British psychoanalyst, Donald Winnicott (who died in 1971), remains just one individual who gave birth to a few great books and lectures that colour the education of present-day analysts rather than, as should have happened, a brand that would outlive him, complete with centres, films, logos and a clear ideology to communicate to the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The a-moral approach to economics and business says a good brand is simply a brand that is strong and popular. It doesn’t matter very much what the content of the brand happens to be. Raw capitalism is impressed only by how many people recognise the brand and spend money accordingly. By this way of thinking, Krispy Kreme is a great brand because of its global success in getting people to eat flavoured doughnuts. But we should really be asking a different question. Which is: what makes a brand admirable in broad human terms? What makes it good in the sense of contributing to human flourishing and helping us lead the best lives we can? A good brand is one that is built round a set of genuine virtues: of qualities that properly help us flourish. We need a lot more of those brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2557766.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5681" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2557766.jpg?resize=635%2C368" alt="First Krispy Kreme Shop In Britain Opens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Put in broad terms, a brand represents the collective. It moves the focus away from questions about individuals. In a law court, for instance, it should ideally not matter terribly much which individual sits in the judge’s seat. The pursuit of justice has been to a considerable extent built into the system so that it doesn’t depend upon the chance feelings or attitudes of this or that person. The hallmark of a thriving culture is not, in fact, the dominance of the individual. It is the dominance of brands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a school, ideally, it shouldn’t matter so much which person is teaching Modern History or Applied Mathematics because the brand sets a high enough standard. Brands are deeply linked to institutions. We’ve tended to see this in terms of less alluring instances: Exxon Mobil, or P&amp;G: brands which don’t really inspire most of us, and even make us suspicious and scared. But equally, the Architectural Association is a brand as is the British Institute of Psychoanalysis &#8211; although on a small scale in comparison with the great commercial enterprises. But this means the problem isn’t brands as such, but which brands we give most attention to and which brands we let have the biggest say over the lives we live.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/485625769.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5672" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/485625769.jpg?resize=635%2C479" alt="Celebrities At ATP Masters Series: Monte Carlo Rolex Masters - Day Seven" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Brands invite the recognition that great things are not usually (actually, practically never) done by individuals acting in heroic isolation. At some point every good idea, every important insight should go through the process of becoming a brand. Because this just means that it should widen its power in the world. And it means other people can join in. The world is in great need of better brands.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Every business tries to satisfy its customers. Its products or services may be modest (cheerful socks), very practical (a petrol station with enough pumps) or rather elevated (a life-changing adventure in the Himalayas). But the underlying goal is always defined by a series of guesses as to what we, the consumers, are going to appreciate. Business is, in this sense, about understanding customers. In a functioning market society, profit should be the reward for correctly interpreting the needs and wishes of the audience ahead of the competition.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet understanding customers is rather tricky. People don’t go around carrying placards that spell out their longings. It is hard for a company to get to grips with the unarticulated – but crucial – hopes, fears and desires of the people who might buy things from them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/460836966.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5639" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/460836966.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Harrods Winter Sale" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many causes of business failure (logistics, internal communication, staff morale, succession, cash flow), but one of the most important and poignant is when businesses go bankrupt because they have failed to understand what it is their potential customers are really looking for; when the demise of the business reflects, first and foremost, a difficulty around interpreting other people&#8217;s needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So let’s consider certain key psychological insights that effective companies might usefully be alive to when imagining that elusive, crucial figure: the ‘customer’:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. A lot of what others need is psychological, not material</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can sometimes seem as if what humans need above all else are physical things: they want to move from A to B, they want warmth, sunshine, clothing, more money, houses etc. This is what the bulk of the economy is devoted to generating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the flourishing company also has a good grasp on the extent to which our physical needs exist alongside some rather more vague, yet no less real or important, psychological requirements. We have extremely strong longings for impressions of:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Calm</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Ease</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Reassurance</span></p>
<p class="p1">– Distinction</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Belonging</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Security</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Sexual confidence</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Status</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Novelty</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Purpose…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Struggling companies are often unsure around these appetites. They get the physical product or service right (with enormous effort and intelligence), but then stumble at this hurdle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, a good hotel (for example) shouldn’t merely be in the business of offering a comfortable bed. It is also there to advance ideas of calm, belonging or reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An investment bank shouldn’t just promise higher returns, it needs to understand the deeper psychological wishes that surround money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And successful car companies know full well that a car isn’t just a padded square box that goes fast: effective cars are bearers of a range of promises about the psychological profiles of those who own them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>2. The ability to teach</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good companies are good teachers. A good teacher has to be hugely conscious of all the obstacles to learning. They have to understand the hidden reservations, doubts and fears which get in the way of someone being receptive to what they have to offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although we never tend to think of commerce under the banner of education, a healthy company, ideally, is an expert teacher, which requires a crucial shift in perspective. One has to identify with the person one is trying to teach: someone who isn’t yet convinced in any way, who doesn’t at all yet know why something matters – something that the company itself has long been very sure about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/462518030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5641" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/462518030.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Classic Car Show Official Launch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teaching requires a surprising act of imagination, and translation: one has to imagine (or just remember) what it felt like not to know or care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Being kind</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Customers don’t typically say out loud that they want a company to be kind. But kindness is, in fact, one of the things we are most sensitive to; and its absence is profoundly disturbing and can be utterly ruinous to modern businesses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If a company smells too cynical, too much in a hurry to extract profit at the expense of its customers, workers or host planet, this can seem – at first – just good, tough business sense. Actually, it makes the relationship between the company and the customer highly fragile. As in a poor quality relationship, the customer might hang on while there doesn’t seem to be an alternative; but the engagement will be weak and resentful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4550538521.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5647" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4550538521.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Apple Unveils iPhone 6" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two big reasons why companies can end up being unkind: arrogance and anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Arrogance:</strong> is a fantasy that you don’t need the other person as much as they need you. It can come from too many years of success. You feel you can get away with whatever you like and they will just have to put up with it. It’s a natural trap for large enterprises because – in truth – they do not usually need any particular customer. Yet to fail at respecting one person is generally a warning sign that one’s in danger of failing to respect many, in other words, that one is close to catastrophe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Anxiety:</strong> in the face of challenges to its very existence, a company may fall prey to the sense that kindness is a luxury it cannot afford. It gets as tough towards the customer as it – perhaps unconsciously – feels the world has been towards it. It starts to get severe, casting aside the need to charm and seduce. It overlooks the first rule of leadership (and parenthood): not to pass on your anxieties to those you are responsible for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Being natural</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of failing companies and individuals have forgotten to ask themselves with freshness and originality: what do I actually like? What would really delight me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So their attempts to please others get stuck in conventional patterns. They follow orthodoxy. They don’t see that they are trying to push on others things that don’t necessarily appeal even to them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since at least the 18th century, writers, moralists and artists have been praising the idea of ‘being natural.’ Naturalness really means: confidence around being honest, simple and straightforward about what one really wants.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_557406b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5651" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_557406b1.jpg?resize=635%2C392" alt="MAURICE SAATCHI AT HIS LONDON OFFICE HQ, BRITAIN  -  JUL 2005" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Philip Hollis/REX</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The natural person doesn’t worry about tradition: about what’s come before. They are more interested in what will be pleasant or exciting or comfortable – even when that might at first seem a bit weird. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To a friend, they might suggest a walk to look carefully at the design of lamp posts; they invite you round to stack the dishwasher or dig a trench in the garden rather than for cocktails. But they don’t do odd things for the sake of being eccentric. The natural person risks being straightforward and simple in the pursuit of genuine satisfaction. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A company might show itself to be less than natural in the stilted language of a brochure or an instruction manual. The description of a resort, a piece of real estate, or airline seat is unlike anything that a real person would ever conceivably say – or want. They fabricate praise, they go in for fake enthusiasm; they fuss and show off. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They want to satisfy customers. But they are too wrapped up in convention, and too cut off from their own native enthusiasms to spot the opportunities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                                          **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider some case studies around some of these basic failures of customer interpretation. Imagine an outdoor sports wear brand. They grew strongly for several years but now things are slowing down. They specialise in clothing for very rugged adventures. A popular advertising campaign from a couple of years ago showed a woman wading thigh deep through a swamp with a knife between her teeth and the distinctive company logo just visible on her high-tech (and very muddy) trousers. They’ve had a policy of only employing – in retail and marketing roles –people who are themselves highly enthusiastic and bold explorers of wild places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company has a vision of the good life which it wants other people to share. But it is beginning to encounter the limits of the existing market of die-hard enthusiasts. It is struggling to reach the larger number of people who are less devoted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company can be seen as having a deficit around our second point: it has a problem with <strong>teaching</strong>. It has not yet understood enough about what might be holding back a lot of other people from getting more adventurous and, as a consequence, becoming potential customers for their distinctive products: hats that are good in deserts and gloves useful on an arctic trip. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4615496811.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5655" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/4615496811.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Street Style - London Collections: MEN AW14 - January 06 To January 08, 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To help them along, one might put together a short film series of ‘heroic stories’. The build up is that we think we’re going to hear stories of overcoming huge physical challenges – scaling ice-walls and hiking across deserts. But actually, the heroism is about psychology; what we’re hearing are the stories of people who really didn’t think they could face the wilderness, who maybe for a big part of their lives told themselves they were indoor types; whose intimidation had all kinds of origins which they gradually learned to realise and deal with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Private visits to some of the stores might reveal service staff who were (though good humoured) unintentionally brusque and confused around customers who were inexperienced and didn’t know what they wanted or might need. The unspoken assumption amongst the retail employees was that this was a shop for the already keen and experienced adventurer. They didn’t mean to be intimidating. but they were. This is what led to the loss of a significant number of sales. Slowly, the company should learn to be a better teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider another example: an airline set up by a self-made (now) billionaire that is losing market share to hungry rivals. The customers feel that the business is somehow ‘mean’. There is an arrogance around the way seating is allocated and charges levied on bits of extra luggage. One would never mistake the rivals for friends, but this company is starting to seem like a pugnacious enemy – despite the low fares. People will not endlessly tolerate a bullying attitude. It is time for the airline to recover the importance of<strong> kindness.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or think of a luxury hotel chain that is in trouble. It’s been losing customers despite trying to make everything so nice. The hotels are certainly grand: a doorman will promptly open the car door when you arrive; the cocktail glasses will be arranged in perfect symmetry at the bar; someone will polish your shoes; there will be specially designed chandeliers in the lobby; the sheets on your bed will have been made with rigorous precision.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/78877582.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5645" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/78877582.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Bargain hunters fill the lobby during th" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But these well-meaning people have neglected the importance of being natural. In fact, no one particularly enjoys heavy elaborate food on a room service menu; there’s something intimidating about too much gold. The advertising reads as if it was addressing a countess a hundred years ago. The hotel has overlooked what it means to feel really at home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, business consultancies aim at improving efficiency. They work to help companies perform more effectively from a technical or commercial point of view: they cut costs, improve corporate structure and examine tax mechanisms. Sometimes, the more psychologically-minded of them look at staff morale and team learning.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s a big challenge too around a more basic step: making sure that the customer is being correctly understood at more than just the level of price: that products and services are ultimately aligned with the functioning of real human beings, rather than the imagined figures in their creators’ minds. More than the commercial world is sometimes prepared to recognise, good business is – to a critical extent – also about good psychology.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When it comes to earnings, there’s an emotionally appealing desire: ideally, we’d want to live in a world where money tracked the value of what people did. &#8216;Good&#8217; salaries would mean work that was rewarded in line with how much it contributed to the lives of others. The highest pay would go to those who were most helpful to society.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some signs, at the moment, that salaries are not always unjust. A brain surgeon is well rewarded but a manicurist earns only modestly. The headteacher of a large school is paid a great deal more than the person serving coffee in a sandwich shop &#8211; and it’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>also just and fair that a cheerful and efficient server will soon earn more than one who is surly and slow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4617930661.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5528" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4617930661.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="'Mario Testino: In Your Face Private View' Vernissage" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But then there are signs of disaster. There’s the senior person in banking who makes a fortune developing products that are more beneficial to the bank that to its customers &#8211; as opposed to the nurse who is paid well below the national average for looking after people when they are most vulnerable and frightened. In such cases, the worth of what someone does and how much they get paid have drifted far apart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This injustice is very familiar. But why does it happen? Sober economists tell us that wages are generally determined by the law of supply and demand. And this law is rather chillingly amoral. It doesn’t ask how noble or honourable or kindly some person is: it asks simply how much the market is willing to pay. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/450096894.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5530" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/450096894.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Key Speakers At The Institute Of International Finance Spring Meeting" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law of supply and demand says one reason why some jobs are low paid is that there is a plentiful supply of people who can do it. If employers advertise posts at a low rate and plenty of good applicants turn up, they don’t need to pay more. This is what happens around nursing. The human value of the work they do is often very high, but there are people willing and able to do the job for comparatively low salaries. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The other reason for low incomes is lack of demand. A poet might be writing profound and beautiful poems but won’t make much money if only a few people feel any inclination to respond to her sensibility. And high quality milk or chickens that have led an athletic life are better than the cheaper alternatives; but unless there is strong demand, it will be extremely difficult to make money supplying them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, there are two basic reasons why some kinds of work are highly rewarded. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In terms of supply: whatever the human value of the job, an enterprise will be lucrative if few people can do a job and someone badly wants it done. For instance, being a hitman &#8211; there are not many people who can accurately shoot to order. Or restructuring the debt of a major construction company or closing a complex multi-party deal to develop a deep-sea oil field.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4587326681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5539" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4587326681.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Breakthrough Prize Awards Ceremony Hosted By Seth MacFarlane" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">Alternatively, rewards will be great &#8211; at least at the top &#8211; if there’s lots of demand, even bad or low-grade demand, for a product or service. Casinos, expensive sports shoes and trash TV shows all generate very high incomes for those who own or run the businesses.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classical economist’s answer is a tranquil defence of the status quo. It encourages us to</span> accept how things are. We might not much like the outcomes, but we are invited to remember that they are not the result of any sinister plot. And there isn’t anything very much that can be done to change things.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Classical economics says it’s no one’s fault if people doing good things are not paid much. It’s what inevitably happens if there is too much labour supply (as with nurses) or when there is low demand for the product (which is why few poets make a fortune). And it is simply logical that people doing things you might consider pretty bad get paid a lot when there is either high demand (as with the producers of trash TV) or because there is low supply of an in-demand skill (thus a few hitmen and bankers will get rich).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5543" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton.jpg?resize=737%2C574" alt="737px-John_Keats_by_William_Hilton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are, however, things that can be done to change this unjust &#8211; but entrenched &#8211; arrangement. It doesn’t focus primarily on trying to equalise salaries. It’s not fundamentally a problem that people get paid different amounts. We’re not too<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>worried about people who earn little doing bad, or if people doing good earn lots. The issue of inequality is far less pressing than the issue of unfairness or disproportion: what we really mind is the disconnection between merit and earnings (equal opportunity shouldn’t really be the main issue either, for this principle doesn’t aim at a better relationship between merit and earnings, it merely tries to make sure that people from disadvantaged backgrounds have the chance to participate in the existing essentially distorted money-making system). If manufacturing ugly memorabilia routinely leads to poverty, that would be fine. And people who earn lots doing a great deal of good deserve their riches. What we aim at here is a Good Salary: a salary that is aligned with the contribution someone makes to the good of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The path to a Good Salary is Education, for ultimately, Education is the word we give to the attempt to train and guide Demand. It is also what restricts or releases Supply.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158532882.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5532" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158532882.jpg?resize=635%2C478" alt="England Manager Roy Hodgson Visits Great Ormond Street Hospital" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nurses, typically, provide a very valuable combination of good will, a high capacity for empathy and an appetite for hard work. But when supply is high, even of something good, there is a danger of a lack of appreciation. It’s like with water in a rainy country: it’s key, but its value is overlooked. In principle we greatly admire what nurses do, only we stop noticing in practice. The task is to turn latent appreciation into active appreciation (so that there is an impetus for a salary rise).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is an aesthetic-political act. In a comic play by Aristophanes, the women of ancient Greece withdraw their sexual services to their husbands, who had come to take them for granted. When the supply is stopped for a little while, the men take notice. Strategic withdrawal to increase appreciation is what, ideally, unions and strikes are for. The key thing is to remind people that they really do value this service very much, and should, therefore, be willing to pay more for it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lysistrata1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5549" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Lysistrata1.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Lysistrata" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">A strike is only one move though in a broader attempt to make a case for the merit of an activity or thing. Remember that our notion of merit is extremely flexible and prone to revision.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are  many moments when we would, as individuals, be willing to pay more for the work someone does for us &#8211; if the case were eloquently made. </span>Collectively we would pay more if the contribution that certain people make were more active in our minds. That is the task of political agitation &#8211; and of art.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what can we do for those &#8211; like poets &#8211; who are doing good things but are not paid much because there is low demand for what they have to offer &#8211; or for nurses who we know do good things but whose causes we forget when supply is too high.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50516672.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5551" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50516672.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="Edith Sitwell;Gore Vidal;W. H. Auden" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The route will always be via Education. If the product is genuinely valuable, it must actually have a lot to offer people but &#8211; for various reasons &#8211; they don’t see it at the moment.  There’s a latent need that could be unlocked. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to unlock demand, the product might need to be tweaked. At present, the poet is devoted to a specific, technical form of writing. But that might not be the most effective way of communicating what is uniquely valuable in their thinking. The task is to define more accurately the good that is on offer in something like poetry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, Education teaches us a truer account of what we need. Better Education shifts Demand in good directions. So the key move would not be to have &#8211; for instance &#8211; more poetry taught in schools by government decree. But, rather, to develop education that is more focused on self-knowledge, which would increase the demand for carefully-expressed insight, thus boosting the market share for poets and taking them a step closer to a just reward for their work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What can we do when people are paid more than their just salary? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">The most obvious answer is the flip-side of the one we have just given: we need to decrease demand, get people to be a little more cautious about certain media, or clothes, or foods they currently invest in.</p>
<p class="p1">At the same time, education should play a role in breaking the monopolies that are responsible for over-elevated demand in some professions and sectors of the economy. The reasons why lawyers and property developers earn so much is not that their services are so highly valued, but because they sit at the head of tightly controlled cartels. They are exploiting Demand by restricting Supply. Not enough people know how to get into their ranks. It&#8217;s &#8211; broadly speaking &#8211; an Education and access problem.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461510376.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5555" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461510376.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="JAPAN-ECONOMY-FINANCE-STOCKS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Education &#8211; at the moment &#8211; typically teaches us to be workers, rather than capitalists. We know how to work for others, but initiating a profitable venture or taking the lead in enterprise feels to many people mysterious and closed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason that there are outsized profits in some industries is that these are operating as cartels and quasi-monopolies. Education and anti-trust laws have a role to play.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The short-term emotional solution</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves however, won’t bring about a quick change. For a long time value and money won’t track each other anything like as well as they should. We’re going to have to live with rewards that are higher or lower than the ideal Good Salary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459270094.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5557" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459270094.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="2014 Champions Of The Earth Award" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To stay sane, in the meanwhile, we have to embrace a tricky (but emotionally calming) move. We have to fully accept that for the time being money is not a good indicator of worth. To some people this sounds so obvious it’s shocking even to have to say it. But &#8211; collectively &#8211; we are very far from giving it whole-hearted assent. In fact, we do tend to see money as the primary marker of success. A few enclaves aside, the poet who sells little is not granted anything like the esteem that is given to the producer of a mass &#8211; but vulgar &#8211; television show. In theory we believe that the primary school teacher is making a more valuable contribution to society than the Victoria’s Secret-girlfriend of a premier league football player. But our society in general gives much more admiration and respect to the latter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The problem isn’t simply that money has come adrift from value. It’s that we frequently act as if money did indeed tell us the crucial thing about a person. This attitude has been taken up by the mainstream Left. They often speak as if the fundamental thing that’s wrong with society is financial distribution. They want profits to be shared more widely, with the average income getting higher and the highest incomes being severely curtailed. While this can sound laudable, it actually endorses a deeper misconception. It says: what matters is how much money a person has, and tries to reduce income differences out of a sense of fairness. In other words, it accepts the proposition that salary is the central mark of the good life and therefore wants to raise salaries for the many.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/72352284.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5560" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/72352284.jpg?resize=635%2C614" alt="Man looking at paycheck" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deeper contention, however, is that salary isn’t a reasonable test of value. This has been taken much more seriously by Christianity, which at its best moments simply admits that, given the state of the world, money has little relevance to assessing the worth, or worthlessness, of a life. Its thought-experiment of being judged after death by a merciful and omniscient God, is never imagined in terms of asking how much money a person made. The judgement is projected as being about such things as how loving an individual has been, how sorry for their failings, how tender to the weak and lonely, whether they forgave those who wronged them. Whether they were in the top or bottom ten percent of income distribution in their country doesn’t come into it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> In line with this, Christianity &#8211; at its best &#8211; has strongly advocated other markers of value: humility, generosity (relative to how much or little one has), piety. Its saints, who function as moral celebrities, were often poor. A great many of its clergy have taken vows of poverty. Its foundational figure, Jesus, comes across as simply not being very impressed by people who have money; while<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>feeling compassion for them, as people especially exposed to spiritual danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5562" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="767px-Rembrandt_Harmensz._van_Rijn_048" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Without remotely taking up the whole Christian world view, one can be impressed and inspired by this concerted effort to develop a scheme of values which gives only a small role to a person’s economic status.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The earnings-worth indicator</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The earnings-worth alignment is one of the most important indicators of how well (or badly) a society is functioning. We should have a public index that measures where we are. In the Utopia, value and salary are in harmony. It is impossible to get rich doing something essentially worthless, and everyone who contributes well is well paid. In the dystopia, money is standardly made in harmful, degrading ways and those who aim at the public good never get properly rewarded. Every society is somewhere between these, but tending on the whole more to one or the other. The Good Coefficient would put a number on where we are and let us see whether we were moving in the right direction or not. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the economy, consumer demand is hugely important. The term ‘consumer’ capitalism acknowledges that economies are largely defined by what people want; by how they use their money.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Governments carefully track how much demand there is &#8211; and panic when there isn’t enough. They sometimes move directly to stimulate consumption. For example, in December 2008, the Australian government gave a ‘present’ of $1000 or more to almost every family in the country, encouraging them to go out and spend so as to avoid recession.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Fluctuations in the the total amount that people are spending each month have direct consequences for employment, consumption tax revenue and investment confidence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/142408235.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5488" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/142408235.jpg?resize=635%2C439" alt="General Views Of Trading At The NYSE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, the focus is very much on the <em>quantity</em> of demand: how much money is being spent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Very little attention is devoted to its <em>quality</em>. </span>It’s considered less relevant <em>what</em> people are spending on. They might be buying doughnuts or taking French conversation classes; seeing a psychotherapist or purchasing sports cars. In terms of GDP, unemployment and the stock market, it doesn’t matter in the least what they are buying, so long as the total spend is high enough (the only caveat is that it is a headache for the state if too much expenditure goes to overseas businesses.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, clearly in other ways it does matter what we spend our money on. Because the combined purchasing choices of millions of people shapes the kind of society we live in and the kinds of lives most of us end up leading.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/167421725.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5492" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/167421725.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="A Season in Kyoto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">If everyone wants gameshows on TV and fast food pizza for supper, a lot of us will end up working in those industries. Because there’s such a wide demand for watching football, the star players become wealthy public personalities and their values and attitudes get a great deal of attention. If, on the other hand, there is little demand for poetry or couples therapy or ritualised tea drinking by moonlight in straw and wood huts (it was big in 16th-century Japan), few people can end up working in these areas &#8211; and if they do, they won’t earn much.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What is Good Demand? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">This is where a major statement of value judgement comes in: there is better and worse demand. Demand for guns is &#8211; we can say with assurance &#8211; less &#8216;good&#8217; than demand for education. Demand for healthy food is better than demand for junk food. We should feel less nervous about treading into the area of values. After all, in our own lives, we know there are better and worse things to spend money on. It&#8217;s not different at a macro scale.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461514754.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5502" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461514754.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Rose's Luxury, A Restaurant With A Rather Unconventional Approach To Service" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take an expensive meal you had. The<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>vodka martinis, the broccoli and cheddar quiche with quinoa crust and the fashionable dessert were very good indeed. But the conversation was lacklustre, you had a row with your partner on the way, you stayed up too late and felt exhausted the next day. You spent quite a lot of money but didn’t manage to target your real needs very well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Or &#8211; more positively &#8211; maybe last year you bought a very nice bedside lamp. It felt a bit expensive at the time (though not in fact very much more than the restaurant meal). But you have found you’ve been reading more in bed, rather than watching television. You’ve been waking more refreshed. It was a great investment and has genuinely contributed to improving your life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So Good demand is defined as: a consumer choice that is in line with an accurate, fruitful understanding of one’s highest needs. It properly pays off. It contributes to a better life, in the long term. </span></p>
<p class="p1">There won&#8217;t be a single set of purchases right for everyone, but that&#8217;s not the point. The issue is merely to get the debate started and to draw attention to the fact there are better and worse purchasing decisions &#8211; and that a society needs to discuss what these might be.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How demand goes wrong </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the moment, the quality of demand is very hit and miss. There are some major reasons why we, as individuals, easily end up demanding the wrong things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a start, it’s hard for us to define our needs. We know we want to be happy. But our understanding of what would work best for us is terribly vague. So we are prone to grasping at whatever is blinking at us most intensely and attractively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50537173.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5504" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/50537173.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Mrs. William Beale" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">What&#8217;s more, we&#8217;re creatures of the herd: everyone else is doing something, so we naturally assume it must be working for them &#8211; even if privately it isn’t. We like to fit in. It must be time to upgrade the TV&#8230;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moreover, there is a hugely active industry encouraging us to want things, not so much because it is in our own true interests to consume, just because it serves the profit motive of certain businesses. Advertising is founded on our inability to hold on to an accurate picture of our true needs &#8211; and to be swayed by random desires instead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459791058.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5508" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459791058.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Girlfriends Guide To Divorce - Season 1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that, individually, we don’t get the happiness we seek. And collectively we end up with a profoundly dysfunctional economy. The forces of production &#8211; and therefore jobs, investment and profit &#8211; are often at odds with our best interests. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Tools for raising the quality of demand</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Raising the quality of demand doesn’t imply a draconian government imposing some supposedly high-minded agenda on a reluctant public. Demand, in a market oriented democratic society, is and can only ever be voluntary. Raising it can’t be a matter of forcing anyone to do anything. What we need is the more important, more humane, task of <em>encouraging</em> ourselves to be wiser in our purchasing choices. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a couple of major ways this can be done: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Consumer education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Between roughly 1950 and 1980, the English cookery writer, Elizabeth David, undertook a heroic campaign to improve national taste. In endless books, articles and television appearances she suggested things people might like, she wittily mocked low-quality goods, she taught people to have higher expectations, and how to enjoy and feel confident around things that might at first have seemed alien or forbidding. (She had a major impact on the growth of the olive oil industry, which when she started was regarded as an irrelevant oddity.) She is an inspiring example of a phenomenon we don’t pay enough attention to: the education of the consumer. She was securely convinced that poor choices &#8211; like buying margarine or refusing to buy spinach &#8211; were not innate unmovable characteristics. In her mind they were simply what happens when you don’t get the chance to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elizabeth-David1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5512" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elizabeth-David1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="Elizabeth-David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an approach with very wide application. With the right, engaging, guides we can overhaul our ideas of what we want in areas far beyond cooking. We’ve done it to some extent around food. But travel, furniture, housing design, education, psychotherapy and relationships all stand in need of their own Elizabeth Davids. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Advertising</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advertising is a major way of changing demand. At the moment, too often, it seems to be an attempt to seduce people into making poor choices by overselling products that cannot in reality deliver on the implied promise. </span></p>
<p class="p1">But this is rarely the fault of the agencies who make the ads. They can only work with what their clients have to offer. But there’s clearly a better option. Genuinely beneficial products, that do promote our better selves, could more vigorously be brought to our attention and their merits rigorously explained. Advertising has a key role to play in helping us to want better things.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Consequences of Good Demand</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Good Demand were more normal, it would transform society. </span></p>
<p class="p1">There&#8217;d be fewer jobs that felt demeaning or degrading because more demand would be directed towards our true needs. Profit wouldn’t look sinister or suspect. It would be a sign that a company was doing the right thing and doing it rather brilliantly.</p>
<p class="p1">We&#8217;ve been too ready to accept that &#8216;what people want&#8217; is some kind of immovable force. In fact, it&#8217;s entirely subject to change. It&#8217;s simply a pity that the only people who actively seek to change what people want are corporations with large advertising budgets and often rather doubtful things to sell us. It&#8217;s time for philosophers and others to engage in the complex, ethical task of influencing public wants: the task of creating better demand.</p>
<p>It’s not a law of nature that we have the preferences we do. We are open to influence. It can be bad influence, but we are also open to being pushed in better directions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over several decades, the measurement of Gross Domestic Product has become the primary way by which we try to tell whether the economy is moving in the right direction. An increase in GDP is taken to show that things are going well, while any decrease is regarded with anxiety.</p>
<p>It’s not an unreasonable assumption. We intuitively understand that GDP gives a rough measure of a flourishing economy. The countries with the highest GDP per capita – Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Denmark, Sweden and Canada – are also pretty successful in many other ways. They are, for instance, all very close to the top of the Human Development Index, which assesses life expectancy and levels of education.</p>
<p>In line, though, with the basic neutrality of Classical Economics, GDP only measures how much financial activity there is. It does not concern itself with how good this activity is, from the point of view of human flourishing. If a nation became obsessed with buying lottery tickets or ringed its coastline with grim apartment blocks, GDP would certainly rise, but not in ways that would constitute progress towards a more flourishing society. GDP is not irrelevant to the good society. But it is a very imperfect guide.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461817160.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5456" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461817160.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Land Securities Group Plc Construction Sites Ahead of Sales Figures" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The ultimate goal of work and money – trade, buying and selling, manufacture, enterprise, corporate activity, financial investment: the whole array of activity which is currently designated Capitalism &#8211; should be human flourishing. That is, an economy geared to flourishing and meeting our highest private and public needs. Good Economics – developed by The School of Life – is the study of the quality of commercial activity, not just the quantity. It aims to track how well (or badly) our actual economy is serving its ultimate purpose. To what extent is it aligned to its true goal? In what ways are we making progress?</p>
<p>It’s not so much that we need to measure overall levels of happiness (though that’s not a bad idea at all). We need some more morally focused economic dials. There are many determinants of happiness which are not closely tied to the economy, like whether we make good decisions about relationships, how forgiving we are, whether we appreciate nature, how we cope with our mortality. There are many areas of wisdom that contribute to the well-lived life and to collective happiness and they all need attention. But we should here consider the economy in a more closely focused way and ask to what extent it is in itself addressing its purpose as an agent of human flourishing.</p>
<p>We’re not suggesting that societies should stop keeping track of their overall level of economic activity. Instead, we want to add some extra dials to the dashboard that tell us more about the quality of that economic activity.</p>
<p>Good economics is crucially concerned with six things that we should be measuring with all the careful attention presently given to GDP. We should be keeping a close watch on:</p>
<p><strong>One: Motivation levels </strong></p>
<p>Typically, motivation is seen as linked to levels of pay. Pay more – the theory goes – and you get great devotion from your employees. But this isn’t quite right. The highest levels of motive –which can be truly extraordinary – arise when people understand that they are serving a genuinely good purpose. Their own role may be modest, but they bring their best efforts to the job because they are proud to be doing it – because of what it is they do, rather than simply because of how much they get paid.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459986434.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5457" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459986434.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="CEO Of Afghanistan Dr Abdullah Abdullah Visits Sandhurst Military Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>We can identify certain organisations or enterprises that have harnessed very high levels of motivation: the Armed Forces in the UK, the Swiss Federal Railways (neither of which offers particularly attractive financial rewards). So, we know it can be done. What we want from statistics is to find out how unusual such levels of motivation are. Are they becoming more or less widespread? Are five percent of employees at this high level – or ten percent? The goal, in the end, is that it should be normal to love your work.</p>
<p>The motivation index shows the percentage of people who feel a high level of devotion to their job for other than purely financial considerations. The higher the figure, the better the economy is, in the large and deep sense, doing.</p>
<p><strong>Two: Misemployment levels </strong></p>
<p>We are all too familiar with the idea of unemployment. And we may be very glad just to have a job at all. The employment rate measures how many people have a job – but it is silent on the character of the job. Ideally, work harnesses people’s best energies and talents, which are precious resources, and directs them productively towards some admirable and socially beneficial result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9190" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p>Misemployment data shows how many people are in work but do not have a ‘good’ job. Not in the classical sense of a job that pays a comparatively high wage. But in a more basic sense of whether their job really is one that a civilised society should be glad anyone is doing. A good job can be modest. But it must be valuable to others. Clearing rubbish from the streets is not prestigious, but it is not misemployment. On the other hand the financial planning sector is firmly white collar but (at least in countries like Australia and the USA where the industry is poorly regulated) the work is frequently not in the best interests of the client and – from a public point of view – essentially worthless. People are employed and are paid, sometimes rather well. But they are often misemployed. The selling of credit cards by retail banks misemploys many people, whose days are spent working out how to get more people to take up credit simply because it benefits the bank if they do.</p>
<p>We want to know what portion of the working population is engaged in activities that are well-directed towards our collective flourishing.</p>
<p><strong>Three: Earnings-Worth Ratio </strong></p>
<p>Traditionally economists have paid attention to who gets paid what and have analysed this as broadly reflecting the state of supply and demand in the job market. But there is a natural longing that earnings should be connected to a person’s level of contribution to the good of others. Sometimes this ideal seems to be realised. The cancer specialist gets paid a lot more than someone stacking the shelves at a supermarket. But it is dispiriting and frustrating to see (as we too often do) people providing a very worthy service – teaching young children, nursing the dying – for a small reward while others do things that are far from inherently admirable or beneficial, like producing trashy television shows or identifying tax loopholes, but for which the rewards are very high indeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456142684.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5459" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456142684.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Teacher Surprised With $10,000 As A Knowledge Universe Early Childhood Educator Award Winner" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>So we can assess to what extent, for any particular kind of work, whether the rewards are roughly in line with – or far above or far below – the worth of the activity. What we want to know is what proportion of jobs are rightly rewarded. In the ideal economy it would be the universal norm. This figure would also tell us something important about the distribution of relative wealth. Societies tend not to resent income inequality when they believe that higher incomes are generated by the greatest contribution to the good of others. What we deeply resent is when some individuals make fortunes from activities that bring no tangible rewards to others and may even be opposed to our best interests.</p>
<p><strong>Four: Right Demand</strong></p>
<p>As consumers we are continually making decisions, large or small, about what to buy. Classically, economists have been interested in the overall amount we spend. But it is important that we assess how wisely we are spending our money. The question should not simply be how much demand there is but how much of this demand is good, or right. Right demand is wise consumption. We always hope that what we buy will enhance our lives. But frequently we don’t grasp our own best interests, or understand our higher needs clearly, enough. So the choices we make don’t actually help us flourish.</p>
<p>Of course sometimes they do. And we want to know to what extent. To study this we need to investigate in detail the experiences of consumers. Did buying that t-shirt or going on that holiday serve your long-term needs? Did it do so more or less than you might have thought? Was it, on reflection, a wise purchase? As with polling data on voting intentions, there’s no need to ask absolutely everyone in order to get a fairly accurate picture of how demand is playing out in the life of the nation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714504.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5460" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714504.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Greeks Prepare For Possible Eurozone Departure After Next Week's General Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>Right demand is immensely significant for the overall character of an economy, because it is demand that in the long run guides the efforts of business and thus defines the kind of work that we end up doing.</p>
<p>Measuring right demand does not, of course, in itself create right demand. But it lets us see something about why we end up spending our working lives as we do. And it therefore gives crucial focus to our ambitions to create a better economy.</p>
<p><strong>Five: Right Profit</strong></p>
<p>Instead of just assessing profit overall, we need to get more ambitious. We should set out to distinguish and measure right profit. Profit can arise in many ways that are not particularly admirable. It can come through exploitation, through the abuse of a monopoly position, by preying on the gullible, by employing slave labour… It is not surprising, with such instances in mind, if some people end up resenting the whole idea of profit.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461820980.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5461" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461820980.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Chief Executive Officer Of SAP SE Bill McDermott Interview" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>Yet, this is not the whole story. Ideally, profit occurs because a business has found a way of delivering genuinely beneficial products or services at a fair price, where the price is above their costs. It might be a lovely hotel that wins loyal visitors with its charming, simple rooms and interesting, friendly staff. It could be a publisher that is able to guide authors to the most attractive presentation of their ideas. Or perhaps an architectural practice that has cracked the problem of delivering beauty rather than luxury. Right profit comes from being efficient in the deeply honourable task of helping people live better lives.</p>
<p>We know that at present some firms, though far from all, are making right profit. What we need to find out is the proportion. How much of the cumulative profit take of business is right profit?</p>
<p><strong>Six: Right Price</strong></p>
<p>The right or just price is determined by what it costs to produce something, or deliver a service, if everyone along the way is treated fairly and decently. We’ve become habituated to the idea that the price of anything should be squeezed as low as possible and we typically take our custom to whichever supplier offers the cheapest deal.</p>
<p>But overall this attitude serves us badly. Partly, that’s because we become the collective cause of so much suffering and anxiety. But in addition because we are not only consumers. We are almost all just as much a part of the productive side of the economy. Right price means that we, in turn, will be treated well in our own work.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714538.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5464" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461714538.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Greeks Prepare For Possible Eurozone Departure After Next Week's General Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>We can already see deliberate efforts to set a just or fair price, like organic duck eggs or fair-trade tea. What we want to measure is how widespread the practice of setting a just price is. So the index tells us what proportion of sales meet this standard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Putting a figure on all these factors would certainly be a demanding task; though modern societies have a very good track record in addressing technical problems of measurement. The resulting information would not just be of specialist interest. It would give us tools with which to build an economy that more reliably increases satisfaction rather than merely wealth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business is a central human activity. In some form or another most of us are involved in business activities most of our lives. It’s the primary mechanism by which human energy, talent and intelligence is harnessed, put to use and rewarded. But anti-business feelings are widespread. There’s distrust of large corporations, doubts about the profit motive. We have the nagging worry that the Capitalist approach to economics might not be properly serving our best collective interests. And yet a world without business seems scarcely realistic.</p>
<p>As with many of our biggest challenges – cities, government, the economy, families – we can’t (and don’t really want to) abolish the thing that’s giving us trouble. We want to improve it. We want finer cities, better government, less anxious families. So too with business. The goal isn’t to get rid of commerce, but to get it to serve our long-term interests better.</p>
<p>Business does not have to be bad. We should try to get business right. To do this, we have to follow twelve principles of good business.</p>
<p><strong>One: Make profit from needs, not from desires</strong></p>
<p>Business means &#8211; at base &#8211; selling someone something. From the pure point of view of commerce, it doesn’t much matter <em>what</em> you deal in: you could be selling shoelaces, crude oil, nanotechnology, handguns, the collected works of Tolstoy. What counts is how profitable the transaction is and what return it brings on invested capital. Entrepreneurs identify peoples’ desires (so long as they are not prohibited by law) and seek to service them profitably.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/186106943-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5256" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/186106943-1.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="The Real Housewives of Miami - Season 3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>It might sound fine, but this is the classic defence for selling bullshit. There are plenty of people who desire the low end of the press, crass television, substandard food, bloated, ugly McMansions, two-million-euro watches and cars that look like stealth fighters. So, inevitably, businesses will evolve to profit from their wishes. Capitalism has not traditionally been interested in whether these are sensible, admirable or worthy desires. Its aim is neutral: to make money from supplying whatever people happen to be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>Philosophy, by contrast, has long recognised a crucial distinction between desires and needs:</p>
<p><em>A desire is whatever you feel you want at the moment.</em></p>
<p><em>A need is for something that serves your long-term well being.</em></p>
<p>And it’s our needs that are required for a satisfying, fulfilled life (which Plato, Aristotle and others call a life marked by <em>eudaimonia</em>).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, desires and felt wants are not reliable guides to a good life. We know this painfully well in small matters. You desire more chocolate biscuits; you want everyone to fit in with you; you feel like lying in bed all day. Desires hog all the attention and it’s very easy for us to lose sight of our true needs. This is no one’s fault. It’s a natural cognitive flaw: the outcome of evolution. In the state of nature, desires don’t split off from needs. The human desire for sweet things served us exceedingly well for almost all of our history: it led us to like bananas and coconuts and apples – things that are very good for us. It’s only in artificial environments that desires can become a problem. The moment sugar refining was invented, the desire for sweet things became a mortal danger. In advanced technological civilisation, our desires can work directly against our needs.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/79655677.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5261" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/79655677.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="War and Conflict, Post World War Two, Great Britain, pic: April 1949, Three London children enjoy the thrill of purchasing lollipops as the Hackney sweetshop well stocked with sweets as rationing becomes a thing of the past" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>The problem is, we’re more aware of our desires than our needs. Desires are obvious. Needs might not be.</p>
<p>Capitalism goes wrong when it exploits this cognitive flaw: large numbers of businesses sell us stuff that we desire but which (in all honesty) we don’t need. On longer, calmer reflection we’d realise those things don’t actually help us to live well.</p>
<p>Sadly, it’s easier to generate profits from desires than from needs. You can make much more money selling bad ice cream than by marketing Plato’s dialogues.</p>
<p>In a utopia, good businesses should be defined not simply by whether they are profitable or not; but by what they make their profit from. Only businesses that satisfy true needs are moral.</p>
<p><strong>Two: Successful capitalism requires education not instinct</strong></p>
<p>Business is guided, in the long run, by demand. And Capitalism tends to assume that we intuitively know pretty much what things we should have in our lives: where to go on holiday, what clothes to wear, what to eat. We might need some emotive prompting, perhaps. But our current economy is suspicious of the idea that people might need to think rationally and exhaustively about a holiday, a meal, a jumper, a car. (Not least because one might come calmly and reasonably to the conclusion that a proposed purchase will contribute little or nothing to one’s long-term benefit.) In strict capitalism, it sounds heretical to say that demand might be wrong or mistaken. How can you possibly say that someone has bought the wrong thing: how snobbish, how mean. Yet, if we look at this issue modestly &#8211; and think only about our own lives &#8211; it’s obvious that a person can purchase the wrong things when the person in question is oneself.</p>
<p>Good capitalism requires that we address two, core educational needs. Getting us to focus on what we really need, what the real challenges in our lives are. And getting us to focus on the value of particular goods in relation to our needs: that is, how do these particular purchases help with <em>eudaimonia</em>?</p>
<p>Businesses can get more meaningful when there is more education of this kind around. The better educated a society, the more likely it is that better businesses will have a dominant position.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/146582168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5258" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/146582168.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="BedZED Eco-Village" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>There’s a parallel with democracy: you can’t have a functioning democracy without an educated electorate. Equally, though we haven’t given the point due recognition, you can’t have a noble kind of capitalism without an educated consumer base.</p>
<p>So, in search of a better economy, we should direct our attention not simply to shopping centres and financial institutions, but to schools and universities and the media. The shape that an economy has ultimately reflects the educated insights of its consumers. When people say they hate consumerism, what they often mean is that they are dismayed at peoples’ preferences. The fault, then, lies not so much with consumption as with the preferences. Education transforms preferences not by making us do what someone else tells us. But by giving us the capacities and skills to understand more clearly what we genuinely do want and what sort of goods and services will best help us.</p>
<p><strong>Three: We need to be seduced by the good not sent on a guilt trip</strong></p>
<p>Those who want to improve the economy often seek to focus attention on cruelties and injustices which may lurk behind apparently innocent purchases.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/179874077.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5243" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/179874077.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Mumbai Sweat Shop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>They point out you are not just buying a shirt, you are ruining someone’s life. They remind you that the grapes that have come half-way round the world to grace your table are helping melt the Quelccaya ice cap in Peru. Some people are responsive; feeling guilty, they change what they buy.</p>
<p>But mostly we’re not like that, we have a much quicker way of dealing with guilt: we ignore it, we switch off, we get defensive and say we don’t care; we tune in to something more cheerful. So, making people feel guilty can actually entrench their behaviour.</p>
<p>We really do need to do something about the ice and the appalling work conditions. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles and the lives of distant others, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make these things not just &#8216;important&#8217;, but also beguiling.</p>
<p>Instead of moralists seeking to modify behaviour by inducing guilt, we need rival businesses seducing customers to buy more admirable products. We need to be eased away from problematic purchases by an environment in which it is more attractive to do the right thing. Good businesses reward us for the slightly higher price we will inevitably have to pay or the little inconvenience we will need to put up with. They make local, seasonal fruits feel more chic; so our pleasure in distinction, fashion and style lead us to renounce the far-flung grapes (and their air-miles) and go instead for a nearby apple.</p>
<p><strong>Four: The task of advertising is to keep our true needs in view</strong></p>
<p>Advertising can often seem like a low, slightly shameful activity. The fear is that advertising creates false wants: it promotes desires we would otherwise never have. It encourages dissatisfaction, envy and frustration. It stimulates vain and shallow attitudes.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/m22383192911.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5263" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/m22383192911.jpg?resize=635%2C587" alt="m2238319291" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if we strip it back to essentials, advertising is basically the attempt to get us to see that something could be important to us. They might not often be getting it quite right, but the underlying idea &#8211; of drawing attention to needs &#8211; is not in itself bad.</p>
<p>The advert says, in effect, you might not have realised just what a good contribution this kind of thing could make in your life. Works of literature and art are often making the same sort of move. Tolstoy’s novel <em>The Death of Ivan Ilyich</em> tries to get us to see that we need more compassion in our lives. In a crucial sense the novel is an advert for compassion.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/41v9237ovWL11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5248" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/41v9237ovWL11.jpg?resize=635%2C596" alt="41v9237ovWL1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But, unfortunately, the more noble products have often been caught up in a snobbish (and misguided) disdain for advertising. They renounce the task of telling the world why they are good, desirable and attractive – and how, in fact, they will contribute to the good life.</p>
<p>There are many things we might buy, which could to a lesser or greater extent help us live better lives. And advertising wants us to see the ‘<em>eudaimonic</em>’ potential of a particular product. Sometimes, of course, an advert might wildly overstate the case. It tried to get us to believe that a certain brand of champagne will improve our social life or that better car insurance will lead to a happier family. The problem is one of exaggeration.</p>
<p>Yet, if there are cases in which we tend to overestimate how much a product can help us, there are also many cases in which we significantly underestimate our need for some other thing. Our society has invested heavily in advertising chocolate bars but hardly at all in advertising couple therapy &#8211; even though the latter may have as much (or probably a great deal more) to contribute to our well-being.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy, for instance, remains comparatively marginal as an industry, while confectionery is massive, because we are so much more alert to our interest in sweets. In good business, advertising is a serious and noble undertaking. It is the attempt to understand and to explain the way a product or service really can assist us in our flourishing. And to get that valuable, important message across despite everything else competing for our attention.</p>
<p><strong>Five: Advertising comes first</strong></p>
<p>The people who make adverts are often extremely good at homing in on what we truly want.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4a9d5_0000.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5249" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4a9d5_0000.png?resize=635%2C356" alt="4a9d5_0000" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The team advertising VW cars decided not to concentrate on the durability of the rubber from which the tyres are moulded or the excellent quality of the wiring. They understood that deep down most people are only moderately interested in the mechanics of cars. And that often our desires are not focused so much on automobiles themselves but on the kind of life we think we might be able to lead around them.</p>
<p>VW adverts understand how great it would be to be part of a warm, funny, down-to-earth extended family. They have glimpsed the truth about our longings. And then, they have the somewhat strange task of slotting in the actual product and insinuating that the car belongs naturally in this great family.</p>
<p>Traditionally, businesses develop a product and then consider how to advertise it. The people thinking imaginatively and seriously about family life are brought in only at a late stage of the enterprise – after the people dealing with things like fuel efficiency, electronics, and anti-corrosive paint have done their work.</p>
<p>In a more evolved version of capitalism it would be the other way round: businesses would start by considering advertising – in the sense of identifying what it is, truly, that people want – and then focus on product development. They’d start with the idea of the strong, warm family and seek to develop the products that would most contribute to that. The adverts are far ahead of the product. We need to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Six: A good business combines command of fun and goodness</strong></p>
<p>Usually fun and goodness have a tricky relationship. Things which are fun are intuitively, naturally alluring, warmly engaging, captivating: cartoons, sweet drinks, alcohol, lazing about, action films. While the things that are good require a bit more effort, self-control and attention. They may be worthy, but they are dull. And this is broadly reflected in patterns of business success. It’s easier to produce things that appeal to the less-elevated sides of our character. Bigger fortunes are made selling french fries than stone-ground bread or made running gossipy, sensationalising newspapers than serious broadsheets; pubs make more money than bookshops; status driven-luxury brands are more successful than fair trade co-operatives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/140310938.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5265" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/140310938.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Women ride Boris Bikes in Hyde park in L" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Logically, it must be harder to make things which are both appealing and good. Because the enterprise needs to solve two big problems rather than just one. The moral producer has to master both <em>fun</em> and<em> goodness</em>. Lots of people have mastered fun; and a fair number of people have mastered goodness. But very few have mastered both. It’s not impossible. It’s not that goodness makes fun impossible, or that fun rules out goodness. It’s just that the target is smaller &#8211; harder to hit.</p>
<p>This integration of fun and goodness is crucial because whether we like it or not we live in a competitive world. Those who advocate goodness have tended to be hostile to the idea of competition; and so they leave the public realm in the hands of those who only care about profit.</p>
<p><strong>Seven: Know yourself</strong></p>
<p>Along with love, finding a job that’s right for you is one of the areas in life in which self-knowledge is crucial. It requires a realistic understanding of one’s needs and potential – and, especially, of one’s limitations. There is a dangerous abandonment of career choice to ‘intuition’. Each person is supposed to work out for themselves what to do with their working lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/socrates-635x691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5267" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/socrates-635x691.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="Athens, Greece - 10 Mar 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>There is continuous loss of potential. Someone who might be a fantastic maths teacher spends many years as a dissatisfied and not terribly effective lawyer. A dental technician might have been happier as a gardener. A chair designer might not have thought of entering into politics (to which, in fact, they could have contributed very well). Someone ends up as a professor of literature when their sensitivity to character and irony might have been invaluable in the higher echelons of the police service. Our career choices are troubled by lack of understanding of what our genuine strengths are (which is not a matter of how we happen to feel but of how we rate relative to others) and by lack of understanding of where those strengths can best be deployed. And we are distracted by the very imperfect distribution of status.</p>
<p>For good business to flourish, we need to give very much more attention to a fundamental question: what kind of job should each person do.</p>
<p><strong>Eight: In good business a job serves the true needs of others</strong></p>
<p>One of the primary things people want from work is a sense of contributing to the collective good. That’s not surprising. Work is just purposeful effort: and we long to feel that what we have put our energy and time into is worthwhile. Our labour should be well directed. Of course we want to be personally rewarded, but we are profoundly social creatures and we need to sense that we are valued members of a community and doing our bit. People have an incredibly strong urge for meaning. Essentially, meaning comes from improving the lives of others, either by reducing suffering or increasing noble pleasures.</p>
<p>The problem is that a lot of jobs do not provide this. A big source of workplace suffering is the fear that our jobs are meaningless. It’s our recognition that there isn’t enough connection between our daily labour and the human good. We are employed, yet it is misemployment.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/86045612-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5269" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/86045612-1.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="A man offers photo leaflets advertising" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Good business is directed at genuinely helping people and makes a profit on the assumption that what it offers is helpful and so people are right to pay the price. The employees of the firm don’t simply get rewarded by getting paid; they get rewarded by experiencing themselves as assisting in making genuinely good things happen for other people.</p>
<p><strong>Nine: In good business, externalities are properly identified and accounted for</strong></p>
<p>Typically, the price of a product or a service does not actually take into account the full cost of producing it, because some resources have – inadvertently – been given free to the producers. In the 19th century, for instance factories were often allowed to discharge raw effluent into streams and rivers. They didn’t have to pay to have their waste products treated and disposed of safely. Society was, in fact, subsidising their products – but without having particularly intended to do so. So too with financial institutions that are too big to fail: their costs are reduced because they don’t have to provide for themselves all the safety nets they should in truth.</p>
<p>A good business culture is one that accepts the true cost of production and supply and in which everyone involved in the supply process is treated decently. The just price reflects these costs. In a good society, the just price would be the normal price.</p>
<p>Whenever a supplier provides something below the just price, they have to be taking a shortcut somewhere. They have to be offloading some cost; they must be treating someone badly; they must be skimping on quality without admitting it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/148196175.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5271" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/148196175.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Primark Expands In Germany" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>As we get collectively nicer, we care more about the path a product took on its way to our lives. The long, expanding history of niceness extends our concerns to the well-being of others who are connected somewhere along the supply chain.</p>
<p>In a good business, the price of the product is just, that is, it reflects the cost of supplying a thing while treating everyone decently along the way.</p>
<p><strong>Ten: Do good through accumulation, not through dispersal</strong></p>
<p>The standard trajectory of philanthropy is: acquire a fortune by rigorous means and then disperse it to good causes. Plutocrats like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick or Andrew Mellon made money in so-called ‘low’ areas of the economy like coal mining, railways, abattoirs, and packing factories – areas where you squeeze costs as tightly as you can and are always looking to reduce benefits as much as possible. However, once the money is in the bank, these rich people wholeheartedly turn their attention to ‘higher’ causes – among which art (and all that it celebrates, like kindness, beauty and tenderness) looms especially large.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PM-140314-moneyC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5273" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PM-140314-moneyC.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="2009 Frick Collection Young Fellows Ball" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Getty</h6>
<p>It’s not ideal to ignore the higher needs of mankind for many decades while pulling together an astonishing fortune and then, later in life, suddenly to rediscover these higher needs via an act of immense generosity towards some localised little shrine of art (an opera house or a museum). Would it not be better and truer to the values underlying many works of art, to strive throughout the course of one’s life, especially within the money-generating day-job, to make kindness, tenderness, sympathy and beauty more alive and real in the world?</p>
<p>Tantalisingly and tragically, the difference between beauty and ugliness, goodness and cruelty is in most enterprises a few percentage points of profit. Therefore, for the sake of just a tiny bit of surplus wealth, wealth that isn’t strictly even needed, human life is daily being degraded and sacrificed.</p>
<p>It would be more humane if rich business people agreed to sacrifice a little of their surplus wealth in their main area of activity and in the most vigorous period of their lives, in order to render the workplace more noble and humane – and then bothered less with dazzling displays of artistic philanthropy in their later decades?</p>
<p>What we’re asking for is enlightened investment where a lower return is sought on capital in the name of Kindness and Goodness. There would be less fancy art at the end of it, but the values within works of art would be far more widely spread across the earth. The true test is how much goodness is done in the process of accumulation.</p>
<p><strong>Eleven: People should be rewarded really well and really reliably for doing good. Goodness is not its own reward</strong></p>
<p>We live in a society in which – as is often lamented – money seems to be the overriding motive; children from the age of five say that their primary ambition is to be rich. Cynically one might say that everyone is corrupt. But one might point to a more generous explanation. In the absence of a better alternative money feels, to a lot of people, like the most reliable and most genuine reward, because maybe – at the moment – it is the most reliable reward.</p>
<p>Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/billgates1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5274" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/billgates1.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="GHANA-US-AID-HEALTH-PEOPLE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The rich are not, therefore, working to make more money with an eye to spending it. They are making money in order to be liked. They are doing so for the sake of status, as a way of keeping score and letting the world know of their value as human beings. The rich work for love and for honour. They stay up late at the office out of vanity – because they want to be able to walk into rooms full of strangers and be swiftly recognised by those that matter – and deemed miraculous and clever for having made fortunes, whose size is carefully recorded by the media the world over.</p>
<p>Wise societies that have properly understood the psychology of the rich now have a trump card to play. As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>Twelve: 80% of profit should come from the top 20% of our needs</strong></p>
<p>At present the overwhelming share of business activity is directed at meeting fairly basic needs: moving about, energy, food, shelter. That is, at present, Capitalism is mainly directed at the bottom layers of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.</p>
<p>For most of history the economy of nations has almost exclusively been devoted to sheer physical survival, with only a tiny portion of human effort and resource going into higher needs. Mostly people were feeding themselves and making huts, with a very small surplus being directed to the more elaborate lives of the rich.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5251" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg_.png?resize=635%2C449" alt="MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.svg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The distinction between higher and lower needs is something we understand in relation to our own lives. For instance, we know that maintaining a long-term relationship is both hugely important and at times extremely difficult. And we know that that’s a higher need than getting a new jumper. It’s not that there’s anything wrong with jumpers – only that their role in the big scheme of our lives should be minor.</p>
<p>We understand we have higher needs – for love, self-esteem, creativity, friendship and moral growth. But we don’t usually imagine commerce being able to help us. We have got a prejudice that paying for something can’t be connected to goodness. Though, in fact, there has long been an assumed link. The person who is offended by the idea of paying to address higher needs might have booked a trip to Florence or Bilbao to visit an art gallery or paid for a concert ticket, on the assumption that the art or the music will address their higher needs.</p>
<p>The fact is, commerce has only barely scratched the list of true needs. We need to live in beautiful cities, we need to have good advice and psychological support, we need to manage our emotions, we need to sustain strong families across generations, we need to cultivate our minds, we need to live in societies in which it is normal to be wise, kind, self-possessed. These are vast, immense undertakings and we have collectively a huge way to go. The fact that these ambitions don’t look the same as constructing highways of building pipelines doesn’t at all mean they are divorced from work, business or commerce. They are goods and services which have to be created by ingenuity, organisation and effort – in short, by work. And that work has to be remunerated. Far from worrying about what we might do when there is no more work, we should be preparing ourselves for almost endless labour to reach the true goal: widespread fulfilment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is entirely understandable that many people are disillusioned with capitalism. Because business as we currently know it is not as good as it should be. Our objection is not, in fact, to business as such but to business that is bad. The response is not, therefore, to wish that business would go away but to work to improve it so that it properly satisfies us as consumers and producers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We believe in censorship. Sometimes. Of course, that’s a very unpopular view these days; censorship looks small-minded, defensive and the enemy of a hard-won freedom to express oneself without interference. People associate censorship with book burning, political repression and ignorant intolerance. The heroic events which ended censorship in Europe seem only to bear this out. For instance, the censorship of Diderot’s Encyclopedia in 1752 was a petty attack by the Church on a sophisticated and deeply useful intellectual project. The ban on D.H. Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover was a comparably idiotic step. When the publishers, Penguin, were tried in 1960 under the Obscene Publications Act, the prosecution appeared dowdy and dim, while the defence was passionate and intelligent. In the history of censorship, it always seems as if it is something of real value – profound, earnest and true – that is condemned and someone vile, corrupt and absurd who is trying to do the censoring.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3773" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipA.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="Risque Reading" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Censors as fools: the Chatterley ban</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But maybe that’s no longer always true. Maybe, just maybe, that phase of history (in which the censored were always good and the censors always bad) has, in the developed countries at least, passed in many ways. The real threat nowadays is perhaps not that wonderful truths are in danger of being repressed by malign authorities but rather that we will drown in chaos produced by aggressive and uncontrolled commercial interests, that we will be overwhelmed by irrelevant, greedy, noxious and unhelpful trivia, and that we will be left unable to concentrate on what is genuinely important and good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3774" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipB.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The FSA's Martin Wheatley Delivers His Report Into LIBOR Reforms" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Freedom of expression or just a pain?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A key argument of those who attack ‘censorship’ today is to claim that we all need to hear all the messages all the time. But do we? Do we, for example, need to hear a message about what kind of scent it would be nice to buy when walking past the riverbank in central Paris?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipC1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4221" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-200314-censorshipC1.jpg?resize=635%2C364" alt="PM-200314-censorshipC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Perfume advertisement on the facade of the Musee D’Orsay, Paris, 2011</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Chanel advert is depressing to the human spirit because it enacts on a large scale, in a conspicuous and prestigious place, a weakness that we know we need to overcome in ourselves: our tendency to escape into distraction, narcissism and useless consumption. The advertisement unintentionally supports our worst sides.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The argument here is that things that draw us away from our true potential should not be paraded in front of us, asking for admiration, at every occasion (on the bus, on the back of the airplane seat, in the street…). In the case of the Musee d’Orsay, censorship would mean taking care that the public environment reflected, and thus comforted and supported, our better natures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censoring an incongruous billboard on the side of a much loved building may not be too controversial. But such an example reveals underlying principles which can be put to further use. Unhelpful messages can be targeted in a number of areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/176633845.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5154" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/176633845.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Real Housewives of New Jersey - Season 5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We know humans can get like this: but does it help us to see them too easily?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take TV, for instance. Television broadcasts have long been censored on grounds of violence and sexuality – and there is widespread agreement that this is an acceptable, and even welcome, restriction on liberty. We know perfectly well that images of an extreme kind are readily available elsewhere if one really wants to go and hunt for them; but an important distinction exists between what people do completely in private and what is acceptable more or less ‘in public’ over the airwaves. But the insight which leads us to censor images because they are too graphic or gory actually applies more broadly than these two usual categories. For the problem is not primarily to do with sex or violence; the real concern is that some scenes that are paraded before us are humiliating to our collective dignity. They give us a shameful view of human nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censorship is not necessarily about making it impossible to view such material. What it does insist on is the private and personal character of the interest: it refuses public endorsement. The most sinister programmes and adverts are those that are confident about their own merits, when they are in fact spectacularly unworthy of regard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a democratic, market-oriented society, public culture is hugely important. It guides our collective ideas about what is admirable or shocking, what counts as normal or weird. It generates a shared perception of status. All public things shape our individual lives, and they make their way into politics and the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Censoring the odd message deserves to be considered not always as an unenlightened suppression of crucial ideas, but occasionally as a sincere attempt to organise the world for human flourishing.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Caspar David Friedrich, <em>Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog </em>(1818)</h5>
<p class="p1">The world needs changing in all sorts of urgent ways: the great question is how to do it. The most popular and appealing answer has long been that one should try to write a book, retreat to a mountain-top, lay down one’s thoughts with passion and cogency, try hard to sell as many copies as possible and wait for change to emerge.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Immense prestige has surrounded this activity for the last 200 years at least and it can seem, from a distance, that it has been deeply successful as well. Some books have undeniably made a splash (<em>Das Capital, Thus Spake Zarathustra, Silent Spring, The God Delusion</em>…)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-18919157.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4295" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-18919157.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="Richard Dawkins in London" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, big book sales aside, the world has continued to change a lot less than it should, remaining surprisingly committed to its familiar wicked ways, despite the existence of so many wonderful, thoughtful, revolutionary and popular books.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we’re missing an insight. Books – however marvellous they may be – cannot, on their own, change very much, and the widespread belief that they can, strongly holds back progressive causes and the effectiveness of enlightened minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A book is of course an ideal place to lay down an ambition, sort out one’s thoughts and gather a constituency. But that’s about it. A book on its own cannot bring about real change because the world as it currently stands isn’t held together simply by ideas: it is made up of laws, practices, institutions, financial arrangements, businesses and governments. In other words, its muscles are made up of institutions and therefore, the only way to bring about real change is to act through competing institutions. Revolutions in consciousness cannot be made lasting and effective until legions of people start to work together in concert for a common aim and, rather than relying on the intermittent pronouncements of mountain-top prophets, begin the unglamorous and deeply boring task of wrestling with issues of law, money, long-term mass communication, advocacy and administration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the <em>Republic</em>, Plato confessed to a profound and melancholy understanding (gathered from bitter experience) of the limits of intellectuals, when he remarked that the world would never be set right until, in his words, ‘philosophers became kings, or kings philosophers’. By which he meant that thinkers should stop imagining that ideas can change reality and recognise that only institutions, ‘kingship’ in this context, have any chance of working a proper influence on the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2015" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/The_Acropolis_Hill.jpg" alt="The_Acropolis_Hill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">How do you change this?</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Partly, the problem comes down to temperament. The types who have good ideas generally aren’t good with money, they get bored with details, they may have the spiky characters which mean they can’t get on with other people, they don’t like going to the office or sharing the platform. Our collective ideal of the free thinker is that of someone living beyond the confines of any system, disdainful of ‘boring things’, cut off from practical affairs and privately perhaps rather proud of being unable even to read a balance sheet. It’s a fatally romantic recipe for keeping the status quo unchanged.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Shelley/Nietzsche: both wanted to change things, neither was too good with administration</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result those with an interest in changing things have typically run what are, in effect, cottage industries. They may have managed to secure a brief spike of fame for themselves, but they haven’t been able to place their achievements on a stable footing, consistently replicate their insights or bridge their weaknesses. Sole authorship cannot be a logical long-term response to solving the complexities of the most significant global issues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is not, of course, devoid of institutions, just most of them are the wrong sort. The mightiest institutions are commercial corporations with unparalleled power, scores of employees, a ruthless focus on profit and a single-minded interest in the material side of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s one exception to this that change-aspiring thinkers should spend some time studying: religions. What makes religions distinctive and inspiring in this context is their genius for getting organised. Whatever one thinks of their ideas (this news outlet is deeply secular), religions are not just about ideas, unlike what atheists sometimes make the mistake of thinking (taking them on at the level of ideas is therefore doomed because they are, in fact, first and foremost institutions). Religions are enormous agglomerations of people with a relentless appetite for administration and bureaucracy. So for example, Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism have all managed to stick around for a very long time because they have related larger ideas about the salvation of mankind to such ‘boring’ activities as running banks, legal teams, community centres, orchestras, youth movements, weekend retreats, radio stations, lecture halls and clothing lines.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They start them young</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Plato’s hope that philosophers might be kings, and kings philosophers, was partially realised many hundreds of years after he expressed it, when in 313 A.D., thanks to the efforts of Emperor Constantine, Jesus took up his position at the head of a gigantic state-sponsored Christian church and thereby became the first quasi-philosophical ruler to succeed in propagating his beliefs with institutional support.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2020" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/coin_of_emperor_constantine1350009158052.png" alt="coin_of_emperor_constantine1350009158052" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An intellectual making friends with power</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A similar combination of power and thought can be found in all the major religions, alliances which we can admire and learn from without subscribing to any of their ideologies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with the world today isn’t that we lack good ideas. We have great, sound, beautiful, enlightened ideas to last us a hundred generations. Enough new books! We don’t have to work stuff out. We have to make what we already know very well more effective out there. The urgent question is how to ally the very many good ideas which currently slumber in the recesses of intellectual life with proper organisational tools that actually stand a chance of giving them real impact in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1">To recap: if you want to have an impact and affect society in the long term, writing things down and giving them to other people to read in the way we do in the contemporary world is fated to be horribly ineffective &#8211; for reasons that only one group of people seem properly to grasp: the religious. From a completely secular starting point, it can be worth studying religions to learn how to alter behaviour.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Repetition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to believe that people don’t do the right thing because they don’t have the right ideas. But in truth, we already have so many nice ideas at the back of our minds; the problem is, we don’t act on them, and we don’t do so because, at key moments, we lack reminders, motivation and encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7859" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C384" alt="11146655355_c6e2cf5f1e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too often, social reformers have implicitly believed that if you just tell people what is right once, all will be well. However, it seems we need to be told things hundreds of times over long periods before they have any chance whatsoever of affecting how we actually behave. Religions are therefore rightly obsessed with repetition. Three or five or ten times a day, they’ll tell us more or less the same thing, because they know that what seemed really convincing at nine in the morning will have entirely gone by evening. Religions have calendars that split time up into tiny segments, each of which has some divine truth tagged to it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes we see a film that makes us want to change ourselves and the world. We leave the theatre vowing to reconsider our entire existence in light of the values shown on screen. And yet by the following evening, after a day of meetings and aggravations, our cinematic experience is well on its way towards obliteration, just like so much else which once impressed us but which we soon enough came to discard: the night sky we saw on the motorway, the line of poetry a friend told us about, the sweet feelings we had after hanging out with a child…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is arguably as much wisdom to be found in the novels of Tolstoy as in the Bible – but the big difference is you’re only meant to read Tolstoy once in your life, if that, whereas a committed Christian or Jew might go back to the Bible every day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ritual</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Wordsworth_001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4300" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Wordsworth_001.jpg?resize=635%2C483" alt="NPG 1857,William Wordsworth,by Benjamin Robert Haydon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Portrait of William Wordsworth, Benjamin Robert, 1842</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A ritual is a repeated, communal event connected up with private individual evolution and enlightenment. The secular world is deeply suspicious about, and inept with, rituals. It thinks of them as ‘fake’ and too bossy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But religions have rituals for everything. All the key moments of life are ‘ritualised’: that is, they are put onto a public footing and given an outward shape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the feeling of relief, gratitude and pleasure that it’s finally springtime. Lots of secular writers have written about this, Wordsworth for one. But the problem with Wordsworth is that – once university is past – we all forget to read him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no such danger of forgetting spring exists if you’re a committed Jew, however, because you have a ritual in its honour in your diary. This month sees the celebration of the ritual of Birkat Ilanot, which involves the faithful being asked to come out of their houses and go into the fields to say prayers from the Talmud at the foot of blossoming trees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s only one of religion’s many beautiful and useful rituals. We need rituals to foster and protect emotions to which we are sincerely inclined but which, without structure and active reminders, we will be too distracted and undisciplined to make time for.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/675px-Chartres_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4302" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/675px-Chartres_1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C573" alt="675px-Chartres_1-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Chartres Cathedral</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world has lots of interest in beautiful things: there are elegant boutiques, celebrated designers, fashionable artists, famous singers and lauded buildings… And simultaneously, there’s a high respect for important ideas and concepts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what’s lacking is any particular drive to try to unite these two elements: to unite beauty with truth, that is, to try to make the most important concepts and ideas attractive and seductive (and therefore far more effective) through the medium of art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what religions have, for their part, excelled at doing. They’ve realised that if you put down an important idea on paper in somewhat pedestrian prose, it won’t have any lasting or mass impact. They’ve therefore, over their history, engaged the most skilled artists to wrap their ideas in the coating of beauty. They have asked Bach and Mozart to put the ideas to music, they have asked Titian and Botticelli to give the ideas a visual form, they’ve asked the best fashion designers to make nice looking clothes and they’ve asked the best architects to design the most impressive and moving buildings to give the ideas heft and permanence.</span></p>
<p class="p1">This is rarely done now. In the modern world, the people who make music are not particularly in touch with the people who have ideas. Therefore many songs, even the great ones, are rather banal at the level of theme, however catchy and inspiring they are in their melodies. Similarly, fashion is seen as an exciting but rather frivolous activity disconnected from anything as grand as changing the world. Serious people rarely think that what they’re wearing may have a grave impact on how what they’re saying is received – something that would deeply surprise a Catholic bishop getting his stunning robes ready for a service. And architects are now rarely invited to put up buildings just in order to glorify and beautify an idea – as the builders of Chartres Cathedral did.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world isn’t being changed as effectively as it should be because many of us are forgetting to study the tips that can usefully be drawn from religion. We should use the history of religion to inform us about the role of repetition, ritual and beauty in the name of changing how things are.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cate Blanchett is on a roll, winning multiple prizes of late, and she’s been nominated for an Oscar too. But she’s been doing something even more impressive than looking stylish and getting tearful on the winner’s podium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s been taking her son Roman, 9, along to the ceremonies. At the recent Golden Globes, the boy looked endearing, impish, well-behaved and curious, and she seemed to be paying him lots of attention (at one point tenderly ordering him an orange juice when a waiter had set down some sparkling water next to him), even though there were plenty of other demands on her time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4225" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettB1.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Cate Blanchett and her 3 sons out for a walk in Manhattan." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we respond so positively?</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to get cynical about this. Isn’t she only doing this to make us like her? But there’s another prior and more interesting question hovering in the wings: why would we like her more simply because she was nice to her kids? Why is it so heartwarming to see a celebrity or a politician being kind to a small person?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has to do with some of our deepest anxieties around inequality. Cate Blanchett is a hugely powerful actress. She has earnt $45million. She commands $5 million a film and a few years back, won a contract to promote Giorgio Armani’s new fragrance, ‘Si’, for $10million. At an award ceremony, Cate’s entrance turns heads. Everyone wants to talk to her. She could humiliate you with a dismissive look. But by bringing along her son to an event (she could very easily have found a babysitter), she’s sending out a signal: she’s reminding herself and, importantly, us of her humanity. Blanchett’s sons certainly won’t care much for their mother’s worldly self. They judge her by a different register. They care whether she helps them with the Lego City firestation, or plays the game with the pillows and the duvet. They tell her frankly that her films are so boring (they didn’t last ten minutes through ‘Blue Jasmine’). And when she patiently explains it’s bed-time or that they can’t have any more ice-cream, they complain that she’s a stupid poo-face. A bit like a court-jester in the Middle-Ages, children play a vital role in the lives of the powerful: they keep them sane by refusing to take them seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cate wouldn’t turn dismissively on her heels because one of her sons wasn’t impressed by her taste in fashion. And she’d be understanding, and more than ready to make a joke, if Roman burped during her speech. Powerful parents love their children even though they have no power, status or money – which is extremely cheering news for most of us, who are in rather short supply in these areas as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children hence function as a bridge between power and humanity in societies that are oppressively, scarily hierarchical. They provide an opportunity – in our age, the single greatest opportunity – for the powerful to rehearse their capacities for kindness, without looking weak, half-witted or slightly unhinged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3747" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettC.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="PM-310114-blanchettC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Without the child he’s just a guy with launch codes sprinting strangely indoors</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When powerful people are gentle with children (usually their own), they reassure us that they understand vulnerability and know how to be sweet towards weakness. Their ease meets our fears. After seeing him on an impromptu play-date, we can take comfort in the idea that President Obama won’t ever curtly say to a restless child keen for a run-around: ‘Shape up or ship out’. And that signals that he probably wouldn’t do the same to us either, even if we’re not three feet high or eager to chase him round the Resolute desk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Renaissance, when the Catholic church went on a drive to boost the profile of Mary, it cottoned on to a crucial move. The best way to suggest that Mary was a nice person was to demonstrate that she knew how to be kind to her child, because this would also imply that she could be kind to everyone who needed her, young and old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4227" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310114-blanchettD1.jpg?resize=635%2C499" alt="PM-310114-blanchettD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Mother to the child-like parts of all of us</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The shameful secret of adult life is that it’s not just children who are child-like. We are all intermittently hysterical, terrified, pitiful and in dire need of consolation and forgiveness. Without bearing grudges, adults tend to be nice to children even when they’re not at their best. Around children, we know how to offer a generosity of interpretation, and a sensitive recalibration of our expectations. No-one thinks a six year old is an idiot because she can’t do long-division; we just accept that it will take a bit of time for her to learn. When children get ill-tempered in the car, we don’t think they have it in for us; we recognise boredom makes people slightly desperate. We’re that bit slower to anger; that bit more alive to potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all deserve more of this kind of attention – but we don’t generally get it. We readily offer children the sort of kindness that we are woefully reluctant to offer one another. We want a world where people are nice to their own children. But even more than that, what we want is a world where people are nice to the childlike parts of other people, including people who aren’t their children, and most of all, nice to those slightly shameful, deeply human and childlike parts of us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5 class="p2"></h5>
<h5 class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/207877923_5f9f8cc75a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6826" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/207877923_5f9f8cc75a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="207877923_5f9f8cc75a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Kew Gardens: here, too, death may come at any time</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A New Zealand-born accounts manager received “non-survival head injuries” after being hit by a Lebanese cedar branch blown off by a gust of wind in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew, south-west London. She was walking through the popular tourist attraction with two friends when she was suddenly struck. The friends of the 31-year-old described hearing a loud “crack” before realising a branch was falling. Despite paramedics battling to save her, she was pronounced dead at the scene. It would have been such a nice day out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why do we care about such stories? For centuries in Europe, artists were trained to produce ‘memento mori’, works of art that would remind their viewers of death. They usually featured a skull and an hourglass.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310314-treeB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4232" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-310314-treeB1.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="PM-310314-treeB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The point of these works wasn’t to make people despair, just to focus on what really matters</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Horrific accidents could serve a similar refocusing function. Most of what upsets us from day to day is disconnected from what ultimately gives our life its meaning – and yet these stresses absorb our energies with vicious intensity nevertheless. Vivid reminders of mortality put our prosaic obsessions into question. When measured against our limited time spans, the true insignificance of some of our concerns is emphasised and our narcissistic, frivolous tendencies can cede to our more sincere and purposeful sides.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News of sudden accidents in parks humbles us into acknowledging that, if life is as fragile as this, if we really have no guarantee that there are decades left ahead, then we don’t want to be people who spent an afternoon arguing with a beloved, who refused to forgive a friend for a minor transgression or who neglected a genuine talent in favour of an unhappy sinecure. The thought of death has the power to rearrange our priorities, returning to the surface the more valuable parts of us which have a tendency to get submerged in the everyday struggles. Evidence of what there is really to fear has the chance to scare us into leading our lives as we know, in the core of our being, that we properly should.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news offers us the opportunity to use its grim stories as our own, modern version of ‘memento mori’. Horrific accidents should cease to be merely records of private pain. They should help us to embark upon the far more important task of living in accordance with our true talents and interests in whatever precious moments we may have left before a falling tree branch calls time on us.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We like it, though we might not always admit that we do, when a celebrity falls from grace. Yesterday they were on the red carpet, everyone was their friend. Now they are in a humiliating divorce; or they are up on drugs charges; or maybe they’ve been caught trying to punch an employee . They had what looked like such a great life; now it’s all falling apart.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/conversationsabouther.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jeremy-Clarkson-014.jpg?resize=611%2C367" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It can seem pretty squalid to enjoy this kind of news. How evil must we be to actually take pleasure in seeing someone go through hell in public. But perhaps something rather different, and a lot more to our credit, is going on. We are mesmerized because we crave intimacy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When you really are close to someone it’s not only their good sides you see; you get to know them more deeply. You see their sufferings, you are there when things go wrong. Part of what constitutes a close friendship is acquaintance with the dark stuff: you know all about the terrible divorce; the drinking bouts and the insecurities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But mostly this doesn’t happen. Mostly we only ever encounter the edited, airbrushed surface of public figures. We say we like strength and admire success. We do, but weakness and failure makes us more connected to the people we like.</span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4379358632_a6c982aa78_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9725" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4379358632_a6c982aa78_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4379358632_a6c982aa78_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p2">It can be easier to feel closer to someone – when things aren’t going so well for them</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Weird though it sounds at first, people become more likeable when we know their flaws. They seem more like us. We’re routinely terrified that if people knew what we are really like they’d ditch us. If they knew what we’re like when we’re in a rage, or drunk or depressed or when we lash out verbally at someone, they’d think we were monsters. Yet the truth is, because we are all like this to some extent, it is actually reassuring, even nice, to hear about the messes in the lives of others. It’s not cruelty that takes us there, but the need to know that we are normal, that our own troubles are not a unique curse, but that similar things happen even to people who – on the surface – have all the things we lack.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the background, with a lot of celebrities, we can sense a huge effort to be perfect. If only they can cook better than anyone, if only they can act in the most successful films, if only they can make a fortune, then people will – at last – like them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But, paradoxically, the celebrity who tried and failed may actually be more likeable. They are doing something more important than they ever could through being perfect. They are rehearsing in public something we all need to do: learn, somehow, to live with our awful flaws, our vulnerability, and our secret patheticness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we only ever see models of poise and accomplishment, we end up with a very strange relationship to ourselves. We start to think that our own muddled, troubled selves are not acceptable and are abnormal in terrifying ways. The limited information we get about other people usually encourages that distorted picture. So it is a great relief – genuinely heartening and welcome – to be shown that it’s normal to be messed up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we take pleasure in reading these stories we shouldn’t be ashamed of ourselves. We are circling round something important, though not quite closing in on it as yet. It’s not that we need to stop, we just need to do it better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The pact with disgrace should go two ways. We benefit from their public humiliation; so we should reciprocate and extend to them the compassion we so desperately want others to give us.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the average citizen of a developed nation, the World Cup generated a deeply unusual emotion. For a few weeks (depending on the fortunes of one’s team), we were allowed to feel happy, perhaps very happy, about something other than ‘me’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is weird, for the whole temper of modern life suggests that there’s only one person who truly counts: you. Your career, your appearance, your spending power, your house, your car, perhaps your kids and your partner too… – but this comprises the sum total of all you’re really meant to be invested in, and to care about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until there’s the World Cup – then suddenly you may find you care with extraordinary intensity about the fate of a group of your muscular, tattooed countrymen on a pitch far away, passing a ball between each other with awe-inspiring dexterity. The team’s progress seems to symbolise the destiny of the entire nation, with which you now identify yourself completely. When your team scores, you share a joy with millions of your compatriots, with whom you feel newly close. Your PowerPoint presentation or forthcoming sales conference cease to matter quite so much. And when you lose, it isn’t hyperbole to say you feel heartbroken, as after the collapse of a relationship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-20286897.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3754" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PA-20286897.jpg?resize=635%2C489" alt="Brazil WCup US Soccer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This kind of collective pride is deeply suspect among the intellectual elite, but it has enormous benefits. First and foremost, it takes the pressure off all of us. It lightens the oppressive responsibility we otherwise feel to ensure that our own lives are stellar and heroic. We don’t have to do it all ourselves. We can instead be proud to belong in a very minor way to a noble and inspiring collective enterprise. Rather than being mediocre on our own, we can find greatness in joining a mighty cause. We can find happiness in something in which we have a small stake, but that goes far beyond us. We can transcend our mean-spirited, insatiable egos.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, with all due respect to the World Cup, the collective pride it generates is undermined and complicated by a range of factors. Firstly, the pride doesn’t last long enough. Even if one’s team wins, it’s still an event that happens only every four years. Secondly, the thing we’re being asked to feel proud about is, in the end, like with all sports, not quite serious: not connected to the truly salient issues and dilemmas of mankind. When everything has been said and done, as even the most loyal football supporter should admit, it’s still just kicking a ball around. And thirdly, the Cup doesn’t give us any clues as to where we might go next with our appetite for collective pride. Once the flags have been put away and the thrills and heartbreaks recede, what are we meant to do with the powerful and beautiful longings we got to know in ourselves? Do we really just have to wait almost half a decade for another brief burst?</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2925257495_9d8593af3d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7803" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2925257495_9d8593af3d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="2925257495_9d8593af3d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The World Cup is valuable in revealing that there’s a big part of us that longs to live more collectively. Yes, we care about ourselves, our emotions, and our careers rather a lot. But this kind of narrow selfishness, so artfully fostered by modern capitalism (you create more anxiety and hence make more money by telling everyone to watch out only for themselves), is deeply exhausting, enervating and in the end unfulfilling. There will, by definition, always be far more ambitions than there are glorious destinies to go around; most dreams won’t come true. How nice it can be, then, to be able to tap into collective achievement and invest ourselves in the best sides of communal life and action.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If our longing for collective pride was taken more seriously, we’d learn to invest more money and energy in things that were owned by everyone, because we’d recognise that this would include us – and could deliver a particularly intense satisfaction unavailable when we have merely feathered our own nest. It may be fun to buy a really nice new sports car (with leather seats and a turbo engine), but there is something properly stirring about being a part owner, along with 65 million others, of the next generation of high speed (200 mph) trains, the Hitachi Javelins, that regularly pull in to London’s St Pancras Station.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And of course it’s interesting to try desperately to fight your way to a promotion at work, but perhaps even more fun to feel that you live in a country which has just managed to build one of the most beautiful, serene and dignified schools in the world, the Marais du Billet school in Lausanne, Switzerland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MCM-Le-Marais-du-Billet-07-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3757" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MCM-Le-Marais-du-Billet-07-1.jpg?resize=635%2C533" alt="MCM-Le-Marais-du-Billet-07-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To console themselves after their dramatic exit from the World Cup, this kind of school is exactly what the Swiss should now be directing their collective energies towards – for it is in every way the equal, and possibly also surpasses in terms of lasting impact, the goals that Xherdan Shaqiri scored with such elegance against Honduras.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What are the ideal targets for collective pride? The ancient Spartans directed their pride towards their military strength. Their neighbours, the Athenians felt proud of the beauty of the Parthenon, the quality of their playwrights and the wisdom of their philosophers. A really fine society is not one that has outgrown collective pride. It is one where people are proud of genuinely great and admirable things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a philosophical thought experiment, let’s imagine the citizens of a future utopian society being asked (when there were no large sporting events unfolding) to list some of the things that they were collectively proudest of in their society:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. The education system</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this ideal imaginary state, in many towns the state high school is the most beautiful building. The curriculum is focused on psychological development and practical skills; it compensates for, and corrects, the failures of home life. School teaching is a highly regarded profession, very well rewarded and difficult to get into. A residual private system struggles to keep up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. The elegance of the cities</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just that there are a few standout famous buildings. Citizens are proud of the diffuse, general beauty of their urban environments. In this utopia, it’s normal for a very ordinary street to look exceptionally charming: you don’t have to pay a premium. Citizens are especially proud of the fact that you don’t have to be rich to live in a beautiful neighbourhood. It’s easy to get around because the transport system is not just quick and safe – it’s pleasant. The stations are treated as public architecture. There’s a lot of censorship over public advertising and signage.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7801" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3895730993_f3fd5aa477_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><strong>3. Low divorce rate</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s entirely straightforward to get divorced. But people tend not to – because of the collective investment in the stages leading up to marriage and because of the sophisticated support provided by the state when things get tricky. The Ministry of Human Relationships (MHR) has a powerful voice at the cabinet table. No government would ever contemplate cutting back its budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. The honours system</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public honours are taken very seriously, but what’s really notable is what they’re given for: the encouragement of maturity, the display of wisdom, the promotion of beauty and the alignment of profit with the meeting of higher needs. Getting an honour is a major focus of ambition for leading entrepreneurs, business and media figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MargaretCalvert-Pic.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3761" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/MargaretCalvert-Pic.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="MargaretCalvert-Pic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Celebrity culture</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a country obsessed with celebrities. Much of the media is devoted to tracking what they do, what they think, where they go on holiday, the clothes they wear, the ups and downs of their relationships. Celebrity interviews are considered the most prestigious jobs in journalism. One of the top celebrities is a part-time waiter in a cafe and is widely regarded as the most well-balanced person in the country. His attitude to shoes, travel (he loves going camping near the lakes) and relationships have been highly influential. Another public hero is the woman who designs road signs. She is deeply admired for her courageous free-style dancing and her attempts to deal with her bad temper.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. The prestige of the careers advisory service, the marriage bureau</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since finding the right things to do with your life – and finding the right person to live with – are the most consequential tasks of a lifetime, it makes sense to give them the greatest attention, guidance and support. The most promising people are recruited into these services so that the maximum level of collective intelligence can be directed at getting these parts of life to go as well as possible. Tourists often marvel at the scale and beauty of the ministry headquarters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. The therapeutic national galleries </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The public collection of art has been reorganised in the service of wisdom and maturity. Instead of arranging the galleries chronologically, the works are grouped (and interpreted) around key themes like anxiety, cheerfulness, facing death etc.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. The cloud festival</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An annual event which takes place early in the evening on 2nd October. Everyone takes time (usually around fifteen minutes) to contemplate the sky. There’s quite a bit of build up; celebrities discuss their favourite kinds of clouds and why these mean so much to them and what they are hoping to see this year. The elderly reminisce about the spectacular 1981 cumulonimbus. Young people are earnestly instructed on appropriate behaviour and how to cultivate the correct inward attitude.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. The world’s highest per-capita consumption of elderflower cordial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not illegal, or even particularly frowned upon, to drink alcohol. But they drink so much elderflower (and other cordials) because on the whole they are very keen on keeping cheerful and focused.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. People often forget the name of the prime minister</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good government is not dependent upon which particular elected representative is in charge. Mostly, the issues which affect everyone’s life are linked to policies which are developed and applied over many years. Elections tend not to be about the personality of party leaders, but more about refining the direction in which the state is travelling.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">11. What’s on broadcast TV</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are very popular programmes about the amateur conversationalist of the year (it was won by a tax accountant last year); the search for the nation’s best argument-calmer-down; there are mesmerising documentaries about people knitting; the regulation of TV has passed away from a telecoms operator to where it should always have been: the health department that also deals with smoking and the sugar content of biscuits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other things people might be proud of:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the richest person in the country is a psychoanalyst</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they have opened the world’s most beautiful suspension bridge</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there are no three star michelin restaurants</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the commissioner of police is transgender</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the proportion of GDP spent on overseas travel is the lowest in the OECD</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there are no crossword puzzles in the largest circulation newspaper</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- on average the heads of primary schools earn more than dentists</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- there is a national reputation for being tactful</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- health insurance plans cover treatment for addiction to internet pornography</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve been so sensitive about what can go wrong around various kinds of collective pride that thoughtful, serious people tend to feel very uncomfortable with the very idea of group activities and causes. The rallies in Nuremberg evoke the constant fear that every expression of collective pride will morph into intense collective aggression and insanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another reason for suspicion is that moments of collective pride seem retrospective, celebrating something good that already exists, whereas in truth, when there are still so many problems around, we are more focused on aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is entirely understandable. But collective pride remains a very important factor in the construction of good societies. Pride in genuinely good things creates a powerful – and hugely welcome – sense of belonging. It assuages loneliness and provides benign motivation. In a secular, complex and specialised world, we need to feel that we are not just stray individuals dependent for our esteem on our own achievements, but also that we are members of a wider entity that we admire and for which we are prepared to work and make sacrifices – an entity which, to put it romantically, we feel ready to love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Yuan Zhouming makes a meagre living polishing people’s shoes twelve hours a day on the streets of Wenzhou, a large city in south-east China. His wife ran off a few years ago, so he takes his four-year-old son around with him while he’s working. The little boy used to beg for food, dart into the road, and sometimes try to steal things from passers by. So the father has taken to tethering him with a rope to keep him out of mischief. He lives his childhood on a tiny patch of pavement. It’s not cruelty, it’s desperation. The father just can’t do his job and keep an eye on Yuan Wang at the same time. At night, they go home to a single squalid basement room. The boy has a teddy bear – his one comfort.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Theoretically, we know quite well that there is something called poverty in China. And we realise that many children in all countries have hard lives. But if we’re honest we have to admit that mostly we’re not moved by these abstract facts. We don’t really take it in.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2842" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artB.jpg" alt="Poor single father's struggle to bring up his young son, Wenzhou, China - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© HAP/Quirky China News/REX</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">News is always running into this difficulty. Unemployment in Greece is 28%. The average wage in China is $7,890 US per annum. There were 300,000 car thefts in France last year. 28% of boys in the UK aged between 8 and 16 say they enjoy reading – compared with 62% of girls. The prestige of data is fed by the tempting but false idea that ‘knowing the facts’ is what matters. Abstract statistics look clever and serious. But so often they just wash over us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The chained boy and his shoe-shine father take us in the opposite direction. We are creatures designed for intimate contact, for local lives and personal relationships. For ideas to become powerful in our souls, they need to be anchored in experience. We need to feel them, see them. This is what art, at its best, lasers in on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2843" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artC.jpg" alt="Poor single father's struggle to bring up his young son, Wenzhou, China - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1816, French newspapers reported that a naval frigate, the Méduse, had run aground off the coast of Africa, with the loss of 133 lives. Only a few survivors made it, clinging desperately to a raft for many days. It could have just become one more tiny forgettable item in the vast catalogue of maritime disasters. But the great French painter, Gericault, made it live in the imagination of humanity for ever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In just the same way, thanks to the art of documentary photography, the story of Yuan Wang and his father has the chance to become more than a dull statistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2844" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-artD.jpg" alt="PM-200214-artD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You would have been unlikely to think of the story for more than a second – until it became a work of art.</span></p>
<p class="p2">News organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information – assuming that if the information is significant, it will go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We merely get bored and turn away when they’re heaped in front of us. In order to matter to us, news has to become skilled at entering our imaginations: it has to accept the resounding truth that bare information isn’t sufficient. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Media organisations want us to care about the bad stuff that is happening out there – and the best way they feel they can do this is to tell us about the gore, the bombs, the landslides, the murders and the calamities.</p>
<p class="p2">In the media’s coverage of global events, the focus is relentlessly on the shocking and the bloody. It’s a strategy that sees complacency as the obstacle to progress. People don’t realise how bad it is out there. If they knew, they’d act.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2879" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/157044107-1.jpg" alt="SYRIA-CONFLICT" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this involves a fundamental misunderstanding of human psychology: when a troubled bit of the earth is seen as deeply awful, news of outrage and horror make little impact. It confirms the bleak belief that the region is beyond all reason and redemption already.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is in part what makes the photographs of Tanya Habjouqa so striking – and so shocking, because rather than showing us hackneyed imagery reducing Palestinians to either proponents or victims of violence in the West Bank and Gaza, she has trained her lens on very different things. She has looked at what is fun, charming, sweet and deeply normal in one of the most troubled regions on earth – the kind of stuff we know intimately and intuitively from our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2881" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TANYA_0002.jpg" alt="TANYA_0002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What every 12-year-old does in pools around the world: they see how long they can float and hold their breath for. Ain Farah, West Bank</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, we know that ordinary things continue in places associated with terror, hatred and intractable conflict. But the media generally only shows us things that make lives there different. Countries disappear into their worst moments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank become suicide bombers and tanks; virulent extremists and wailing mothers. And so we stop caring, which has serious policy implications. Widespread indifference makes diplomatic disengagement inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The route to caring about the extraordinary is through the ordinary. We need to feel close to the ordinary moments of others’ lives before we can care about what happens to them in their tragedies. This is a brute fact about the mechanics of sympathy which the media has forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2882" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/TANYA_0011.jpg" alt="TANYA_0011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Girls from Ramallah, trying on dresses for an upcoming school dance</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If these girls were in Essex or Hamburg, it would be merely another night out. Here it becomes an achievement. It radiates hope. The people doing the bombing suddenly seem shallow by comparison. Why don’t they care about the things that actually matter to people and the real pleasures of existence? It’s moving and reassuring that the attractions of dancing and high heels are not going to be extinguished, for they are astonishingly resilient, much harder to get rid of than fear and prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2883" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Occupied-Pleasures-by-Tanya-Habjouqa_31-1024x682.jpg?resize=1024%2C682" alt="A toy store van drives along Gaza's beach high way." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The power of normality. Sponge Bob might not seem impressive in a shopping centre in Manchester or Lyon. But it becomes moving to imagine a child coveting a SquarePants doll or the parents organising a themed party – in the Gaza strip</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels paradoxical, but if we don’t see people as sharing our concerns, our pity will be abstract and insubstantial, easily put aside.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2884" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6-ladies-who-rally-photograph-series-by-tanya-habjouqa.jpg" alt="6-ladies-who-rally-photograph-series-by-tanya-habjouqa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Tanya Habjouqa</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Women who rally in the West Bank. Like the women in Nashville. Like your cousin. Like your best friend’s sister. The driver loves Top Gear. She can’t be denied basic rights. She is why diplomacy matters intensely</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to retrain our war photographers to show us not just the horror, but also – as importantly – the everyday. Currently, despite the media’s amazing technological capabilities, despite the bureaux, correspondents, photographers and camera operators, we are given no information whatsoever about ordinary occurrences. We don’t know whether anyone has ever had a normal day in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for no such thing has ever been recorded by a Western news organisation. We have no idea what it’s like to go to school or visit the hairdresser in Bolivia; it’s entirely mysterious whether anything like a good marriage is possible in Somalia; and we are equally in the dark about office life in Turkmenistan and what people do on the weekend in Algeria.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That should change. The ideal news organisation of the future, recognising that an interest in the anomalous depends on a prior knowledge of the normal, would tell us about street parties in Addis Ababa, love in Peru, in-laws in Mongolia and rally-driving in Nablus, so that audiences would be prepared to care just a little more about the next devastating typhoon, violent coup and appalling cluster bomb.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In their more serious moods, news organisations tell us they want to explain the world to us. And that often means talking about money.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s certainly a lot of information about money in the news: our eyes are regularly directed towards a variety of key indicators on the economic dashboard, including the money supply (M1, M2, MZM), central bank reserves, factory orders, the consumer price index (CPI), building permits, jobless claims, the deficit, the national debt and, most significantly of all, the GDP.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2897" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chart5.gif" alt="Chart5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The complexity of the financial machine soon shuts most of us up. Only a tiny percentage of us have any real understanding of the workings of the economic system we exist within. This isn’t a coincidence. We’re badly educated more or less on purpose. It’s a strategy to keep us quiet. Conveniently, most of us will constantly struggle to grasp quite what might be going on within essential terms like arbitrage, Basel 1 and 2, cyclically adjusted current budgets, price/earnings ratios or quantitative easing. As we follow financial events in the news, we ask, in utter confusion: what is the growth rate of money? How do hedge funds operate? What does the LIBOR rate determine? What is liquidity? How does inflation targeting work? How can a government ‘print money’ and what are the long-term consequences? Why are some people rich and others poor?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Those kindly commentators occasionally employed by news organisations to help us with our confusions certainly try hard to offer us explanations, but their explanations have a habit of leaching from our minds just hours after we have heard them. But even if we don’t understand much, sometimes we still wonder whether things are arranged as they should be. Lying awake at night, for instance, some of us may wonder, in a sincere and yet inarticulate way, why it is that the world built by capitalism is not (bathos intended) nicer. Why is there still so much suffering all around? Why do some have so much and others so little? Why are most jobs mindless? Why can’t there be more security and leisure? Why do anxiety and fear persist almost everywhere? Aren’t we destroying the planet for no particular reason or reward? (By this time it may be getting very late, and only a stubborn few will continue to press on..) Couldn’t we start again in some new way, rejig things, perhaps pass some laws and experiment with bold new ideas in order to create a freer, less anxious, happier world?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2898" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/natural.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Blend Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are made to understand – in a variety of subtle ways – that these aren’t serious questions (growing up means being made very aware of the dangers of being idealistic or even worse ‘naive’); these are the sorts of questions that fourteen-year-olds write poems about or argue with their parents over. In the morning, we’ll put them firmly away. They don’t belong to the standard narrative of economics in the news. We may blanch to think of what any properly intelligent and sensible person might make of them – someone like, say, the chair of the Federal Reserve, the most powerful economist in the world today.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2899" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/yellen.jpg" alt="Yellen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Paul Beaty/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But our questions only seem immature because we have a false image of maturity. We associate maturity with a sober acceptance of a great many things that we should refuse to accept. Standard economic news is mostly a story of pain, teaching us a lot of complicated but sound reasons why a great many nice things aren’t possible: why we can’t wave a magic wand and make poor countries rich; why competition and therefore anxiety are necessary in a market economy; why total job security makes people lazy; why a country has to reward its winners and punish its losers; why rich people can’t be proportionately taxed; why we can’t all live more simply yet still with dignity; why governments can’t limit the free market in the name of higher values; why inane consumer goods are an indispensable part of a flourishing economy; why it’s good for growth if people don’t generally share and recycle their belongings and why we can’t afford too intense a concern for making the world beautiful and clean.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So we end up with a news agenda dominated by reports of the workings of a highly complicated social science that wrestles with problems of near cosmic scale and incomprehensible difficulty, upon which it periodically delivers pronouncements at once pessimistic and resigned – and on the other hand, we have a host of naive, innocent, impassioned but powerful longings that are carefully concealed and mostly go unmentioned for fear of sacrificing claims to decency and adult seriousness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Occasionally, the tensions get too much and there are explosions. A group of people collectively declare that they’ve had enough, paint some placards, buy megaphones and take their positions outside the central bank, the fast food concession or the oil company headquarters. A few weeks later, after some moments of exuberance and struggles with heavy-handed police, the makeshift camps are hosed down and the news moves on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2900" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/occupy-1.jpg" alt="Occupy Wall Street" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Bebeto Matthews/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These explosions are undermined by a fatal naivety, that is, by a set of the best possible intentions to improve a problematic situation – combined with a lack of any effective or forensic knowledge about what has caused it in the first place. A complaint that might have occasioned an intricate political argument instead ends up as a primal scream.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is partly to blame for this incoherent rage; it is the news that helps to raise audiences that cannot make sense of and feel hopeless about their condition and that are fed a diet of economic analyses that skilfully crushes ambitious considerations of how to create a more equitable world. The protesters rightly recognise that there are things wrong with the economic system – but they find it hard to zero in on the specifics of the difficulties. It would take concentrated periods of guided interrogation and study to understand the mechanics of the financial machine – as well as to lay a skilful finger on the realistic options for its reform. Tantalisingly, there are a great many very sensible options out there – which, non-coincidentally, we never hear about in the news for very long.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most news is uninclined to provide a proper economic education equipped with a robust political dimension, either because it is itself confused and distracted about, or benefits from, status quo. It isn’t the task or within the power of news to solve all economic conundrums by itself. Its power is more secondary, and yet still it is considerable: the news has the ability to define the agenda, by leading the attention of an audience to what it believes to be the issues of importance and then to deliver an interested and knowledgeable constituency to governments and corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At present, mainstream news organisations chiefly track the day-to-day activities within the economic establishment. They tell us what is going on, but not with any conviction of what might or should happen. In so far as the news creates an agenda, it is a limited one: whether one should intervene to bolster the labour market or not, leave or join the currency union, remain strict about inflation or be less vigilant. The economic ‘debate’ as it is seen through the lens of the news does not stray beyond tightly-defined lines which restrict both an audience’s expectations and its sense of what might be possible. Depart from the agenda (ask about reconceiving what a shareholder is and should be, for example, or question assumptions about growth and well-being), and with bewildering speed, one ends up in territory deemed ‘radical’ and therefore, ridiculous – even if most of what we now take for granted (a minimum wage, child protection, environmental legislation) started off by seeming entirely radical, if not insane, to ‘sensible’ opinion.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2902" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_805674a.jpg" alt="Evening Standard newspaper headline on the credit crunch,  London, Britain - 09 Oct 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Ray Tang</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A perfect news service would analyse current events, but also convey a bold sense of the economic principles that would ideally underpin society. It would be guided by a sense of where one should be going, operating with an economic utopia in mind, a community both prosperous and civilised, concerned as much with money as with its proper ends: fulfilment, fairness, generosity, beauty and kindness. It would be doctrinaire only about the destination, while remaining empirically flexible about the means of getting there – unlike right and left wing analyses that grow brittle and tiring through their axiomatic support of predictable means.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While continuing its regular routine of analysing derivatives, yield ratios and the state of M2 money supply, economic news should not forget its ultimate responsibility to a larger quest for a world capable of sustaining less anxious and ruinous, more secure and more meaningful working lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such an agenda, however fey it sounds within the context of classical economics, is at this point in our history too significant to be stumblingly raised only in private in the middle of the night or else shouted in a hoarse voice from a megaphone seconds before a police charge.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Last week the Dow Jones Industrial Average started on Monday at 16,162.70 and rose and fell each day. It surged on Friday towards 16,400 but fell back to close at 16,321.71. It was not an all-time high (a few weeks ago it peaked at 17,576.66). Still, the long term trend is definitely upwards.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Dow, which is the world’s most prestigious financial index, takes a daily temperature reading of the US, assigning it an astonishingly precise number. Behind this lies an almost unimaginable complexity of human behaviour: deals were made and broken off, sales teams in Mexico reported above average orders for catering equipment, slightly fewer bicycles than expected were bought in New Zealand, predictions were made for the future demand for copper in India and the state of negotiations in Syria was scrutinised, Putin’s attitude to the Ukraine was speculated upon, millions of meetings took place. All this activity, hope, anxiety and thought is summed up in a single figure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2819" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesA.jpg" alt="PM-060314-dowjonesA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to treat such numbers with a high degree of reverence. They seem to be telling us something of immense importance. They hint at an answer to the great question of existence: are things going well or badly, is the world doing OK? How is life on earth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really worth asking such questions and reflecting heavily upon them. This is what philosophers traditionally like to do.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2820" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesB.jpg" alt="Japan Toyota" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sales of Japanese cars are stagnant in Brazil – the Dow noticed on Wednesday and made a correction</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the numbers do not actually answer our question, for the links between the Dow Jones figures and what is actually going on in our lives (their rise or fall) is vague. It’s not that there is no connection whatsoever. The financial health of major US companies does have indirect, distant links to the economic side of everyone’s life. Yet the quality and character of daily life is powerfully affected by a great many things which the financial data does not recognise, for example, your health, the view from your window, the quality of your relationship, the state of your ambitions, your degree of envy, how your kids are doing. These may, indeed, be rather more important in determining ‘how things are going’ than the Dow Index. But the Dow doesn’t entirely admit this. It seems to be making a larger claim: to know how your life is going – and it brings to this claim a panoply of impressive arrows, charts and incomprehensible acronyms which cow us into believing in its authority, rather as our ancestors might have trusted in the confused mumblings of a priest sitting on top of an altar in a darkened temple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2821" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesC.jpg" alt="New Bank of England Governor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">Teenage angst numbers under review</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all our expertise, we have not yet learned how to devise reliable indicators of the state of nations and individuals. We do not have a daily set of figures to record what truly matters. It might help, for example, to know the incidence of unnecessary embarrassment or whether arrogance is becoming 0.1% more or less common. We don’t have figures measuring supplies of patience, tact and forbearance. We don’t have indices around envy, infidelity and fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of these vital indicators, we cling to the signals offered to us by Wall Street. We use words like depression and exuberance, terms well known from personal life, to describe the movements of stocks and shares.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To ask for better indices of national well being sounds whimsical. Yet it ought not to, for we need data that homes in on things that matter greatly for what our lives are actually like. Issues like jealousy, boredom, frustration or anger shape our destinies just as much – if not more – than the fortunes of 3M (the Minnesota Mining Company) and the twenty nine other corporations whose trading forms the basis for calculating the Dow Jones figures.</span></p>
<h5 class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2822" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-060314-dowjonesD.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We need an index to measure this</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big issue here is how we can get a diversity of indicators on our national dashboards. We are not in the least suggesting the suppression of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. What we want to see is the rise of other – equally important – figures that report on a regular basis on elements of psychological and sociological life and which could form part of the consciousness of thoughtful and serious people. Today, a government cannot get rewarded, or chastised, for the impact its policies have on the frequency of domestic rows because rows are not recorded. When we measure things – and give the figures a regular public airing – we start the long process of collectively doing something about them.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It can be strangely appealing to be very down about the future of humanity. When we think of the future, apocalyptic scenarios come so naturally: flooded cities, energy crises, civil wars. We’re afraid of being naive. After all, we were promised jetpacks and won’t be so easily taken in again.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8075" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532.jpg?resize=468%2C532" alt="article-0-032E0941000005DC-109_468x532" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>We like to tell ourselves we’re too intelligent to be excited by the future. But there’s another possible explanation. We’re oddly a bit resentful: it can be painful to imagine all the things we’re going to miss out on.</p>
<p>Imagine going back in time to 14th-century Europe and confronting people with the solutions which &#8211; a few centuries later &#8211; became readily available.</p>
<p>One might meet a woman whose six-year-old daughter has just died of scarlet fever. She’d be hysterical with grief. One would then explain that in 744 years time, there would be (on the very spot where she was standing) a chemist where &#8211; for £2.50 &#8211;  she could have got the antibiotics that would have saved her beloved child.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ptolemy_map_15th_century.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8076" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Ptolemy_map_15th_century.jpg?resize=635%2C486" alt="Ptolemy_map_15th_century" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>Or imagine describing Heathrow Airport and the Boeing Dreamliner to a man who had starved, suffered seasickness and been taken prisoner on a three-year-round pilgrimage from Berkshire to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Or telling a guy with toothache about the anesthetics which he wouldn’t be able to get for another 623 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medieval_dentistry.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8077" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Medieval_dentistry.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="Medieval_dentistry" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Or confronting Jamshīd al-Kāshī &#8211; a 15th-century mathematician who spent years of his life doing vastly complicated calculations to work out the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle &#8211; with the fact that his sums would one day be do-able with a small plastic box picked up next to the express checkout at the supermarket.</p>
<p>We could imagine such people coming to deeply resent news about the future. Instead of seeming inevitable, our miseries can come to appear like cruel, temporary accidents. We stand to realise that in the broad span of history, people don’t have to suffer many of the things we’re going through &#8211; we just happen to be condemned to them because we’ve been born at the wrong time.</p>
<p>A visitor from the future will no doubt pity us as much as we pity our medieval ancestors. They’ll feel so sorry that we had to have an unhappy marriage &#8211; 27 seven years of anguish, shame and frustration for both parties &#8211; which would so easily have been solved in a few minutes by having a minor adjustment made to the Ventral tegmental area of the midbrain of one of the parties.</p>
<p>They’ll feel appalled that we had to die of pancreatic cancer. Or work so hard in a more or less meaningless jobs when, at last, robots are truly doing everything and there’s a guaranteed income for everyone on the planet equivalent to what a Swiss dentist earns today.</p>
<p>We’re often negative about the future to defend ourselves against recognition of how absurd much of our suffering will seem from the position of 300 years from now. We are faced with the cruel thought that solutions to some truly horrible problems of today might be just over the horizon. But unfortunately, still too late for us.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_Museo_del_Louvre_1818-19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8078" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_Museo_del_Louvre_1818-19.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="800px-JEAN_LOUIS_THÉODORE_GÉRICAULT_-_La_Balsa_de_la_Medusa_(Museo_del_Louvre,_1818-19)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p>The 19th-century French painter Gericault focused on the agonies of this kind of missing out in his monumental depiction <i>The Raft of the Medusa</i>.</p>
<p>The sailors of the shipwrecked vessel <i>Medusa</i> had drifted for two weeks. In the painting, Gericault shows us the moment when the survivors who are still clinging to the raft finally catch sight of the ship that will rescue them &#8211; the tiny sail can just be seen on the horizon. But for many the rescue was too late: they died just before the ship could reach them. A few days, or even hours, sooner and they would have been spared the most horrible agonies.</p>
<p>We too are like the survivors on the raft. The rescue ship will come &#8211; but too late. We should feel a reasonable and appropriate pity for ourselves. We deserve compassion because &#8211; even if they are comparatively comfortable &#8211; our lives are still actually very hard when considered in the light of the future. We can identify a new kind of comparative poverty that we are suffering from: when a person is poor not in relation to what others around them have now, but poor in relation to what people will have at some point in a dimly imaginable more advanced and more intelligent future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making clever machines. It’s coming along very well. There are already some phenomenally smart boxes out there, including the ATM, your mobile phone and the automatic landing system on an Airbus A380. People can do all the tasks these machines perform for us, only much more slowly and very much less reliably.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/maxresdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5828" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/maxresdefault.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="maxresdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people think of how machines will help us in the future, the emphasis naturally falls on the performance of rational executive tasks: machines that will help us to calculate, plan, translate, divide, carry, move and build.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But one should also envisage a rather different and far more exciting scenario, one in which computational power isn’t merely directed at the scientific and logistical dimensions of existence, but also at its emotional and psychological ones. It is time to imagine not merely AI but also, and even more significantly, what we here call A<em>E</em>I: Artificial Emotional Intelligence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need AEI rather badly because our emotional frailties dwarf our incapacities in raw mathematics or data management: we make extremely poor decisions about how we should manage relationships. We have little idea what job to focus on and when to quit. We don’t know what to spend our money on. We get holidays wrong. We have no clue how to repair friendships or handle tricky employees; we fumble as to how to get reconciled with our parents and (some of us) how to write a good novel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_3731522c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5831" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rexfeatures_3731522c.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="Star Wars Day, London, Britain - 03 May 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">© Rex</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The emotional intelligence required for these things is – at the moment – in very short supply. It exists, but in isolated and mysterious pockets: a few people seem to cope but on a basis that is desperately private and concealed, the way that a wild strawberry might have seemed before the invention of farming.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, at heart, emotionally-wise decisions aren’t luck at all. They are the result of our brains, which are complicated networks of synapses in brine, resolving certain puzzles very well – and they are therefore logically also forms of intelligence that can be replicated and improved upon artificially, with the help of microchips and code. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are at a juncture in history where we can already perceive what is coming: a particular type of scarcity will start to give way to abundance. A sort of transformation that has occurred many times before in different areas of existence – agriculture, transport and energy – is about to strike the field of emotional intelligence. We’re about to make emotional intelligence as common and as cheap as electricity or pencils. We’re not used to thinking that the next big thing will be tackling the scarcity of wisdom, but this is – we feel – what’s on the cards.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span><strong>SIX AREAS WHERE </strong><em>AEI</em><strong> WILL REVOLUTIONISE THE WORLD</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Self-knowledge</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Knowing yourself is at the heart of directing efforts successfully &#8211; and communicating inner needs and perspectives to others. The idea of self-knowledge has always had high prestige but the opportunities for acquiring it have been restricted. It’s taken too long, been too chancy or (if one seeks help via a therapist) too costly. The current lead-vehicles for self-knowledge – books – are highly inefficient, are directed at a generic reader rather than you in particular and carry insights that drain quickly from our leaky minds.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_57211171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5832" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_57211171.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="Library study" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI will draw on more reliable information about what is really going on inside our brains and will tell us and those we care about who we are, what we are feeling and what we should optimally seek at any point in time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, we are often deeply ignorant about where our talents lie, what our flaws are and what are true interests might be. Our c</span>onsciousness doesn’t grasp at all well what is happening to its owner. For example: I might not realise that the true cause of my irritability is tiredness; I might think it&#8217;s simply that my partner is being excessively obtuse. But AEI  will get us the self-knowledge we need. It will map brain activity and alert us in good time as to the reality of our psychological lives. Or I might feel that the dullness and anxiety I experience most days could be solved by throwing in my job and going travelling for a year &#8211; whereas in fact, the real issue might be bound up with a need to address my relationship with a competitive older brother.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With AEI technology, the work of therapy – to help us understand ourselves – will be hugely speeded up and made more reliable and cheap. We will get much better in two areas in particular: knowing what job we should be doing. And knowing whom we should try to form a relationship with and how.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_502265949.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5833" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_502265949.jpg?resize=635%2C524" alt="GettyImages_502265949" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today’s dating questionnaires and career counselling tests will – from the perspective of twenty years hence – seem as barbaric and hopeless as medieval brain surgery strikes us now. We will at last be equipped with machines to which we can address not the simple puzzles of our times (‘where is the nearest pizza restaurant?’ ‘how much is $100 US in rupees’?), but also the truly important emotional questions with which we fumble: who should I marry? Is this job in line with my true talents? What should I try to be?</span></p>
<p class="p1">AEI will give us a picture of our inner selves which will prevent us making so many catastrophic errors on the basis of a fatal inability to interpret our own emotional functioning and psychological potential.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Education goes desperately wrong, because we’re not good at knowing what particular individuals are capable of, what they really need to know, when it’s best to try to teach them – and what manner of instruction will suit their temperaments best.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_461762836.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5835" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_461762836.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Financial Education in Shanghai University" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all know from our own lives that there are moments when we’ve made remarkable strides and others where progress has been slow, but our society has yet to arrive at sound generalisations. The idea of how you make ‘a good teacher’ is still shockingly mysterious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People are therefore funnelled, sheep-like, into classrooms and talked at for hours in ways that serve a lot of them rather poorly. But our educational problems aren’t just around schools; throughout life – in relationships, at work, in families – we are always stumbling because of deficiencies in learning. AEI will help us to evolve towards the best versions of ourselves. We should – ideally – die with far fewer regrets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: News Media</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re agreed that high-quality, widely-disseminated information is vital to a flourishing society. That’s why certain news organisations make huge claims about how well they keep us informed – and what good citizens they help us to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_156249125.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5836" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_156249125.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Crisis Talks Continue At The BBC Following The Resignation Of Director General George Entwistle Over The Newsnight Scandal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, news media feeds our brains in highly inadequate, sporadic and often manic ways. We do need good information, in the right doses, about the right subjects, to help us lead our lives. But we’re currently far from getting it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_453494052.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5837" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_453494052.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="BuzzFeed Gets $50 Million To Propel Value Past Old Media Titans" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Bloomberg/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This matters so much because the media sets the backdrop to politics: it establishes the general picture of what life is like in our society (of which we witness only a tiny portion firsthand) and defines the parameters of what politicians can change and address. Getting the right information into wide circulation, however, is exceedingly difficult, because our brains are designed to be more engaged by the wildly exceptional (an axe murderer, a celebrity wedding) rather than the important and the sober. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a future with AEI, we’ll know how to lead people to information that is genuinely fruitful for them and their nations, rather than merely click-baiting them with stories that shock, titillate and horrify, but don’t manage to change anything in the world other than the bank balances of the evil geniuses at Buzzfeed. We’ll get better media and in turn, better democratic politics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Great works of art are at present incredibly rare. We are trying hard to ‘farm’ art, but it’s not going very well. We have costly writing and art schools that start with the best intentions, charge a fortune and are the focus of intense hopes, but they turn out mediocrities by the hundreds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_478045327.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5839" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_478045327.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="&quot;Vs./Better&quot; Charity Art Exhibition Opening Reception" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">A Tolstoy, Picasso, Lennon or Louis Kahn are still agonisingly unique. AEI will stop us having to feel so grateful to them. We will, for example, be able to produce novels like those of Tolstoy on an industrial scale, but geared towards our own particular circumstances and cultural references. <em>War and Peace</em> is often appreciated for its wisdom and insight. But the author exercised his mind on understanding the world he knew best: that of wealthy Russians living in the 19th Century. As his readers, we are left alone to guess the implications for our own radically different lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With AEI to hand, we would be able to direct Tolstoy’s emotional genius on the specifics of our own lives. We would be able to summon up a Ugandan Tolstoy or an East London Tolstoy: the same level of maturity and compassion, the same verve in characterisation and storytelling, but all focused on what it’s most important for us to dwell on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task for AEI in the arts will be to replicate and diffuse a level of wisdom and talent once only lodged in a few rare minds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Shopping</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consumer society is really about choice, and in so far as it makes us happy (rather than leads us to squander our wealth and energies), it’s about wise choice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_135445029.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5840" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_135445029.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Shop West End VIP Weekend - Sponsored by American Express" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This opens up a huge area for AEI. Think of what we have to choose (and how badly we often do so): travel destinations, art, books, clothes, foods… At the moment, we tend to operate on a mixture of intuition, hope and habit and are routinely abused by advertisers along the way. We have massive frailties in this area: we’re heavily influenced by what others are doing (though it might not work for us);<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>impulse plays a big role (though it’s not the most reliable guide); and we leave a lot of things to chance (we go for what happens to be most readily available). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI will mean encoding consumer intelligence. Just as we might work out a sum in our heads and then check it on a calculator, so we will be able to check our decisions on an AEI device. We can imagine already what would happen with an ideal travel agent, book store attendant, art tour guide or personal shopper. AEI will make these figures into daily realities, revealing how we can be persuaded, moved and motivated to acquire goods and services in line with our true needs. Money will, at last, make us as happy as it can.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Relationships</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s extremely hard to be wise around relationships and the consequences of our unwisdom are devastating. We have great difficulties when it comes to communication, we suffer from impatience at not getting what we want, we are defensive in discussions and have troubles talking calmly through hopes and failings around fidelity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">AEI means we will be able to tap into the lessons that others have, often very painfully, learnt. Each couple will not be faced with having to confront every hurdle anew late at night in the bedroom. If you could at critical moments (in your head) dial up your most patient, experienced, sensible and generous friend and get them to talk you through an issue, feeding you helpful moves – a huge quantity of distress might be avoided. Relationship AEI will take the wisdom out of the ideal friend’s head and gives us all access to it when we most need it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_56614046.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5841" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_56614046.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="Couples gaze into each other's eyes by c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">*** </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, there are some big anxieties around AI: what if machines take over that are really versions of very cunning, powerful people? This way of thinking is based – rightly – on our sense of how rational, executive intelligence can be impressive but also horribly brutal: Vladimir Putin is highly intelligent, Goebbels was in some ways extremely smart. Massively increasing rationality can be a frightening prospect. But the cure to these fears is to focus on what sort of intelligence AI should really emulate and enhance. Increasing <em>emotional</em> intelligence isn’t frightening, it is the key to all that we most value: empathy, creativity, kindness and generosity. We face a race to ensure that we can have adequate levels of maturity and wisdom to counterbalance the enormous increase in our technical prowess. Worries about machines ‘turning evil’ might be more accurately expressed as a fear that they will lack emotional intelligence. This doesn’t have to be the case.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today &#8211; unlike any other period in history &#8211; the major impediments (to economic progress, better politics and more flourishing lives) are all psychological. It’s mainly the flaws in our emotional capacities that ruin existence. But we’ve not yet really concentrated on addressing how to make ourselves more mature. It’s been left to the hazards of individual experience. AEI will use technology to reduce the randomness. Just as, now, everyone can spell ‘scythe’ or work out the square root of 11935, thanks to AI, we should all soon be able to connect with machines that help us correct the range of our emotional failings. The age of AEI is urgently due.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He looks like an ordinary guy. He could be the taxi driver who took you to the airport, a maths teacher or the manager of a gym.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2950" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageA.jpg" alt="Media Summit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, he’s one of the richest and most powerful people who has ever lived. Co-founder and current CEO of Google, he has a personal wealth of upwards of $20 billion and a profound role in shaping the modern world. Just into his forties, he may still only be at the early stages of his career.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4211" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageB.jpg?resize=635%2C543" alt="PM-200214-pageB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Just a nice guy</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The down-beat, casual personal style seems endearing. How nice that he’s not at all pompous. But those jeans and T-shirt signal something deeply disturbing and cause us immense underlying psychological problems. By stressing how average he is, Larry projects the idea that it is within the reach of everyone to be like him. If you’re not a multi-billionaire by the time you are forty, there might be something wrong with you. Through his manner, Larry tells us implicitly: one of the world’s largest, most powerful and respected corporations is being run by an ordinary down-to-earth guy. That message has a nasty sting in the tail: it might be abnormal to be you, who also looks so ordinary but, sadly, has no corporation in the background. This is pretty devastating. Larry is a great business leader in many ways. But, without meaning to, he has hugely damaged our pride.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2952" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageC.jpg" alt="PM-200214-pageC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world presents itself as egalitarian – and it is, in the sense that, in principle, people can come from any background and get to the highest positions. It’s just that, in practice, most people almost always don’t get very far. It’s the way of the world. There are more ambitions than there are glorious destinies. We are the victims of class, genes, biology, bad luck and our own lack of inspiration and confidence. We are told repeatedly that we are free to succeed. What is less often stressed is the way social mobility works both ways: we are also free to fail – but when we do so, we can blame only ourselves for our mediocrity. We are, to use that crushing word, losers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a new kind of agony, this status anxiety. In the past people at the very top went to great lengths to show how different they were from everyone else and how inconceivable it was that you could ever get to be like them. Their clothes, habits, ways of life were utterly distinctive. They made it clear that they were not normal in any way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4213" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageD.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Portrait of Louis XIV of France" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span class="s1">Louis XIV was not like you</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Louis XIV of France liked to wander about in ermine cloaks and gold brocade coats. He carried a golden stick. He sometimes donned a suit of armour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4214" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-pageE.jpg?resize=635%2C451" alt="Portrait of Louis XIV of France" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was all very haughty and unfair, of course. But it did have one great advantage. You could not possibly think you could get to the top and be like Louis. You couldn’t envy the king, because envy involves thinking it is theoretically possible to secure what the envied person has already got.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not trying to tell Larry Page to put on a golden suit or carry a sceptre. He can keep wearing the jeans, but we – his viewers – should appreciate what problems all this causes us. We need to work on greater compassion for ourselves. It’s hard to live in modern times when the rich and powerful often look just like us. Unexpectedly, we all pay a price in anxiety, every day, for those wardrobe choices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2956" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200214-pageF.jpg" alt="Earns Google" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is almost universally agreed that education is hugely important. But we are not particularly sure what we want from it. Our large commitment to there being good schools ironically has not been matched by concern about what they are for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of education is to prepare students for adult life. So the role of schools should be thought through only after we have identified the challenges of adult life. If school is essentially conceived as a training, we need to explain what it is training <i>for</i>. What are the relevant difficulties and challenges that we need to be equipped to deal with?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1323" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150855855.jpg" alt="BASIS charter school opens in DC." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© The Washington Post/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are two fundamental tasks education should help us with: <i>working</i> and <i>sustaining good relationships.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These goals are generally acknowledged, but in a hazy and distant way. We hear that studying literature might help the imagination or that knowing some history will make us more capable of understanding current societies. But these pieties don’t generally rise above the level of generalisations – and are not explored with thoroughness in the actual curriculum. We do not assess courses and classes as we should – according to the help they really do provide in the task of being a good adult.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we work backwards from life, it is clear that schools fail all but a tiny portion of their students. This is a generic problem, as much in evidence in posh, highly academic private schools as in more deprived, government-run ones. Trouble around work and relationships remains very widespread indeed. Human ingenuity, energy, goodwill and talent is still being lost on an industrial scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1324" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/165442320.jpg" alt="11/16/05 - TORONTO, ONTARIO -Nadia is the 7th grade teacher we're following with a monthly series th" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Toronto Star/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get more ambitious about education doesn’t necessarily mean spending more money, building more schools, employing more teachers, or making exams more difficult. Rather, it should chiefly mean focusing more clearly on the real purpose of education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, unlike today, schools would be designed by people who asked systematically about the main problems in people’s work and home lives – and then worked backwards to put adequate, thoughtful responses in place in the training years. In order to address our needs, a future national curriculum might specify that the following subjects would be studied:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Capitalism</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is at present a conspiracy of silence around the economic system we live within. We find it hard to change its bad sides (or defend its strengths) because we simply cannot understand how it works. Nothing captures this more than that we currently study maths when, in truth, we should really (from a very young age) study the one thing that maths is used for by 99% of the population: money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, there would be extensive classes on the workings of Capitalism. One would study how profit occurs, why some areas of activity are much more profitable than others and how economic opportunities arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1325" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150771522.jpg" alt="Woman working in books with Euro bank notes, Symbol: tuition fees, free learning aids, etc." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© U. Baumgarten via Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim would be to demystify the economy and to educate citizens to be realistic both about the opportunities they’ll have and the economic constraints they’ll face. Students would be taught to see that an economy is ultimately always the creation of society, not an act of God or nature. This is crucial since so much of how our lives pan out is broadly determined by the kind of economy we live in: why are there more jobs in nail bars than in therapy rooms; why do footballers make more money than brain surgeons and why do so many jobs have titles like assistant regional distribution executive, rather than carpenter or farmer? All this and more would be explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An important unit in this subject would be the study of change in society. What enables revolution (whether of a commercial, ethical or political kind) to occur? A great deal of attention would be paid to the fact that mostly our frustrations and disappointments do not directly lead to improvement. And yet – this point would be written up in large letters in every classroom – improvement truly is possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1326" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/165283240.jpg" alt="165283240" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Toronto Star/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under the heading of change, students would study material which, at present, is classed as history. They might look at the Chartist movement of the 1840s, the Russian Revolution or the Reformation, but from a totally practical point of view, as potential revolutionaries themselves. What lessons could one learn from each event? One would never (during one’s whole time at school) simply try to understand the past for its own sake. One would only ever investigate it as a series of case studies from which one was trying to extract useable wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Business</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this set of courses, students would learn how to deal with the world of work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They would learn what the options really are – and the relationship between early choices and subsequent destinies (the purpose would be to reduce the chances of anyone in the future waking up aged 48 in despair, wondering what they had done with their life). They would learn what a business idea really is. They would discuss productive and less productive sectors of the economy. They would understand the role of cash flow, HR, leadership, marketing and competition. They would learn how to deal with colleagues, burnout, envy, office politics, interviews and sackings. They would spend three hours a week exploring and discussing what they might do with their future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1328" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/167068189.jpg" alt="Mature students on MBA course, University of Westminster" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this would begin from the age of 8 – rather than being left as a set of arcane secrets available only to an elite who can embark on a ruinously expensive MBA aged 27.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Consumption</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the view of what you’d need to learn would be very broad. It would reject the Romantic assumption that we each hit, by instinct, upon our own understanding of what is right and good for us. Instead, the education system would work on the assumption that we can learn how to enjoy ourselves, what to admire and how to flourish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Schools would pursue these topics with an eye on students’ actions as consumers. The economy we get depends very largely on what we want to pay for (McDonald’s, Easyjet or…). So consumer education is vital, and in no way a trivial after-thought.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This course of study would explain the relationship between consumption and flourishing. The underlying idea would be that one ought always to buy the things that have been ethically produced and that help one to become a better version of oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1329" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/187085293.jpg" alt="Top Christmas Presents For 2013 Revealed" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There would be units on: what to read, what kind of clothes to buy, what films to see, what TV programmes to download, what food to eat, what furniture to invest in, where to go on holiday. In each case, students would learn to ask how a given purchase would meet their needs. Courses on consumption would often overlap with the self-knowledge lessons [see below].</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In special classes, specific items – a coat or a car, a novel or a sofa, a water jug or a Picasso poster – would be analysed in terms of their potential to fulfil us. Students would be required to analyse what kind of person would benefit from ownership of these precise items. They would have to define the need which consumption meets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose would be groundbreaking: not simply to generate infinite consumer choice, but also to bring up generations that would know how to choose wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Self-knowledge</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The self-knowledge classes would be central to the whole system of education. Students would be introduced early on to the idea that we are extremely prone to misunderstanding ourselves, that we do not automatically have a correct or insightful view of what we are up to, or are bothered about or grasp.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They would be taken through ideas (many derived from psychoanalysis) as to the roles of delusion, defensiveness, projection and denial in everyday life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1330" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107828668.jpg" alt="SLUG: dc-arts26 DATE: 01/20/2006 PHOTOGRAPHER: Sarah L. Voisin/TWP id#: 176656 Washington, DC The Fi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There would be individual tutors on hand with whom students could work to develop a map of their characters, with particular attention paid to their neuroses and defences. After this module, students would quite easily, and with good cheer, be able to describe in what ways they were a little mad (as we all are). They would know rather a lot about how they were difficult to live with, and what sort of people it did them best to spend time around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial unit would be devoted to career self-knowledge: what job are you best suited to do? Ending up in a job that you like and feel is worthwhile is a huge – perhaps the biggest – attainment. Self-knowledge in the area of employment offers protection from the ravages of envy. We get less bothered by the fact that others have more glamorous, more highly paid careers if we see clearly why such options would not really fit our characters or temperaments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b><i>Relationships</i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">School is a preparation for coping with the difficulties (and making the best of the opportunities) of adult life. And the Utopian society would be intensely aware of the social and individual cost of every unhappy relationship. So there would be huge emphasis on gradually acquiring the knowledge, attitudes and skills that help people live well together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1331" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/150673324.jpg" alt="CHINA-EDUCATION-DANCE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early years, getting on with others would be a central focus of attention. After puberty, the focus would be on relationships. There would be units on kindness and forgiveness. Pupils would pass not when they know the theory but when they could demonstrate in practical tests their actual readiness to forgive when there are reasons to feel righteous and to be kind when its tempting to be vindictive. Techniques for the reduction of anxiety would receive much attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under relationships there would be classes on how to have an argument, on the successful ways of persuading and on allowing oneself to be persuaded. Students who did well would feel some of the same glory as is currently accorded to those who pass maths exams with honours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, school buildings would also be a focal point of civic pride, widely admired for their beauty and serenity. Running a school would be one of the most prestigious and well paid jobs. Only the most wise, kindly and insightful people would be employed as teachers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1332" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144850620.jpg" alt="TUKE SCHOOL, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would not only be children who went to school. Adults in general would see themselves as in need of education. One would never be done with school. One would stay an active alumni, learning throughout life. In the adult section, there would be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. There would be career advice for the middle-aged. Schools would be where a community gets educated, not just a place for children. So children would feel that they were participating in the early stages of a life-long process. Some classes would have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia the phrase ‘I’ve finished school’ would sound extremely strange.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1335" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/845125101.jpg" alt="Queen Paola of Belgium (R) and Princess" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, education would be viewed in a properly holistic way. It wouldn’t just be something that took place in classrooms. Anywhere where citizens were influenced and conditioned would fall under the remit of the education department. So the department would control media, broadcasting and the arts, because newspapers, galleries, museums, theatres and television channels would be seen as essentially educational – and judged, developed and controlled so as to maximise their effectiveness in teaching the things we most need to learn. There’s little point spending millions educating the citizenry in wisdom in classrooms then allowing a tight-knit group of banal and venal television executives or newspaper proprietors to pump out material that directly undermines the preceding effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re so hung up on the challenges of running a massive education system, we’re failing to pinpoint the real source of our problems. It isn’t primarily about money, salaries, discipline… Troubles here are only a consequence of a more basic difficulty that precedes them all, namely, right now, with no one quite meaning for this to happen, but with untold consequences and costs,<i>we’ve got the wrong curriculum</i>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">While most of its energy is devoted to briefing us about the gruesome ways in which various people have recently blown up or bled to death in a brutal stabbing, in the area known as ‘health news’, the media takes on a very different project. Here it constantly collects information to assist us in the task of living for a very long time – or possibly even, though it doesn’t ever come out and say this directly, forever.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, we have been told – by scientists (always ‘scientists’) – that eating seven portions of fruit and vegetables a day will hugely prolong our lives. Cranberries are now far healthier than was ever thought. Bananas continue to attract the admiration of ‘scientists.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2409582661_22387a9d53_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7847" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2409582661_22387a9d53_z.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="2409582661_22387a9d53_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Scientists! Those magical beings permanently poised to alter the nature of reality, busy inventing microscopic robots that will travel through our veins; synthesising drugs to regulate our moods; mapping our genes; cloning our organs and limbs and reassessing the life-and-death-giving nature of everyday foodstuffs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To live in modern times is constantly to be reminded that thanks to science, a golden land is on the horizon. This is partly why we must keep checking the news in the first place. We might hear that death has been abolished.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2918" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-020414-fruitB.jpg" alt="PM-020414-fruitB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Religious art never lets you forget that death is lurking beside your ripe peach</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, one day, in 800 years time, it will be. But it will be a little late for you and me. And an extra plate of grapes and peas won’t help. The end of the story is written in stone. Religions used to be less squeamish here. They used to talk a lot about death, then place the task of preparing us for it at the heart of their collective missions. They were generous about our need for consolation and comfort in relation to something which no scientist was about to abolish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern news is harsher. It keeps making us hopeful about science without letting us accept the inevitability of where we are all heading. It doesn’t talk with any honesty about final things, it merely keeps drawing our attention, with deranged zeal, to the newly discovered anticarcinogenic properties of blueberries, courgettes and cassava.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew Ridgeley recently turned fifty. In the mid-1980s, he was one half of the world’s most successful pop duo, Wham! Alongside his friend George Michael, he topped the charts in the UK and the US.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After the band split, he tried acting, car racing and a solo performance career. But nothing came to much. He now lives in an old farmhouse in a remote part of Cornwall, with his partner of many years, Keren Woodward, who used to be in the girl group Bananarama. He plays golf, goes to the pub and worries about sewage being pumped into the sea. He looks like an accountant or someone whose cement mixing business has done rather well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4238" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyA.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="PICTURE SHOWS EX-WHAM POP STAR ANDREW RIDGLEY IN CORNWALL.  THE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Bill Griffiths</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, it is natural to think of Andrew as a bit of a failure. He fell off the stage of stardom. He’s the guy who used to be famous. He’s been forgotten. He has given in to ageing. George Michael has gone on to have a stellar solo career, has made enormous amounts of money and kept himself at the centre of public attention. He’s still wooing the public and putting a lot of thought into getting his eyebrows right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2910" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyB.jpg" alt="PM-280214-ridgeleyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Michael: Still looking for love from everyone</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact it is Andrew who has been successful. And this triumph shouldn’t just be a matter for him. The kind of success he now has is deeply important for the modern world to understand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2911" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyE.jpg" alt="GEORGE MICHAEL AND ANDREW RIDGELEY IN WHAM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s all so opposed to what he used to stand for. Andrew was at the heart of a hugely infectious view of life. He was a high priest of an ideology, if you like, which was preached through music.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2912" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyC.jpg" alt="WHAM" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">80′s pop had immensely seductive ideas about sex, relationships, family life, work and personal style. It told us that nothing should stand in the way of having a good time. If anyone tells you to knuckle down, to work hard, to put others first, to feel sorry or ashamed, to think of the future – ignore them. They are conformist oppressors who don’t know what life is really about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an addictive outlook. It picks up accurately on what, at moments of high excitement, feels like the truth. It lashes out at anything that causes resentment, boredom or disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2913" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-ridgeleyD.jpg" alt="Crowd At Last Concert By Pop Group Wham! At Wembley 1986." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely successful. But it’s also a disaster. The trouble is that it only works for short manic bursts. Life can’t be properly lived this way. This is what Andrew has discovered. That’s why he’s so important. He’s not someone coming from the outside pouring scorn on what a lot of other people like. He’s the guy who was there. He knows exactly how big the allure is. So we can trust him when he turns his back on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t generally think of resignation as a virtue; it sounds like failure. What it means, though, is recognising that big things in life – an OK relationship, a secure sense of self-worth – require giving up some excitement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pop idea of life was so unhelpful because it pretended that excitement was the way to a good life. So it made casual sex seem wonderful, it made the after-party look like the high point of social life. It was the continuation of a Romantic philosophy: the ecstasy of the moment is what counts. On the other hand, resignation means seeing that the ecstasy of the moment is often (sadly) the enemy of what we really want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4240" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-ridgeleyF.jpg?resize=635%2C434" alt="PM-280214-ridgeleyF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Quite a lot really is enough: Wham and Bananarama discover the meaning of life.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrew’s long-passed successes as a performer and song-writer have left him well off by ordinary standards. However, he could have made a great deal more money if he had really set his sights on continuing in the world of fame and glamour. This may seem like a minor issue, but a huge part of how the world works is driven by people’s relentless ambition to have ever more status and money. One thing that Andrew therefore does is to define for us a conception of being satisfied, of having enough – even when more would have been an option, but at the cost to relationships, health and family.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to think that it doesn’t matter much what kind of music is popular. So long as people like it, don’t worry, it’s just a bit of fun. But music is one of the biggest influences that shapes a culture. It encourages an attitude to life. The songs get inside our heads and the ideas they carry with them stay there – influencing how we value ourselves and our goals.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The life of Andrew Ridgeley belongs in the public realm. It’s one of the great moral fables of our time. It’s the story of one man’s redemption – from manic, narcissistic pleasure seeking to maturity. But it’s not just his story. He shows us what we need to do collectively, as a nation. We live in a Wham! society – and yet we need (as it were) to move to Cornwall.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s just one thing Andrew might still do. And that’s write compelling songs about his ordinary down to earth life now, with its ordinary pains and longings, its reconciliation with reality mixed with the odd idealistic dream. Or perhaps he could just suggest that we listen to London Grammar, who are on to that already.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Despite good intentions, modern societies are profoundly unequal. Yet contemporary culture encourages the feeling that in crucial ways, everyone is, in fact, on the same footing. Not in terms of current possessions and status, but in terms of potential. Today, you may be short of cash, low on prestige and bruised by rejection. But these are – so it’s insinuated – transient troubles. Hard work, a positive attitude and a couple of bright ideas can fix the issue in due course. There are always some encouraging stories circulating: for example, of the guy who trailed around South America for five years not doing very much of anything, then came back home and started a business making sportswear that got sold for just short of a billion. Or the woman who made a fortune with a retail recommendation app created in her kitchen.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2396" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1603649-1.jpg" alt="The Hamptons in the Summer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">© Getty</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Traditionally, the thought that someone somewhere had some great asset you lacked (a business, a prestigious job etc.) would have felt like an impersonal fact, with no bearing on your inner life, because there was no possible route from where most people were to the possession of such a thing – anymore than a peasant could hope to become a knight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cleric-Knight-Workman1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4209" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Cleric-Knight-Workman1.jpg?resize=635%2C453" alt="Cleric-Knight-Workman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Where it doesn’t feel like there’s a possibility, there is no envy</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the spirit of modern society is one of intense equality, which is a torture in terms of envy, for when egalitarian ambitions circulate in societies that tell themselves that anyone can do anything, the experience of envy goes into over-drive. We don’t envy everyone, we do so only when we think their advantages are within our reach. So when almost everything feels like it could be ours (but a lot never can be), the opportunities for envy grow dangerously large.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, our society both generates untold quantities of envy and also (in a strange hang-over from the Judeo-Christian past) seems to condemn anyone who might admit to experiencing the emotion too intensely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-069.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4205" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/06-069.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="06-069" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sufferers of envy suffering eternal torments in hell, according to Dante in the Divine Comedy</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, to feel embarrassed by our envious feelings risks encouraging us to repress them – and therefore, to lose out on deriving some hugely important lessons from them. While envy is deeply uncomfortable, squaring up to the emotion is an indispensable requirement of a decent life. It is a call to action that should be heeded, for it contains garbled messages sent by confused but important parts of our personalities about what we should be doing with the rest of our lives. Without regular envious attacks, we couldn’t possibly know what we wanted to be. Instead of trying to repress our envy, we should hence make every effort to study it. Each person we envy possesses a piece of the jigsaw puzzle depicting our possible future. There is a portrait of a ‘true self’ waiting to be assembled out of the envious hints we receive when we flick through a magazine, turn the pages of a newspaper or hear updates on the radio about the career moves of old schoolmates. We should calmly ask one essential and redemptive question of all those we envy: ‘What could I learn about here?’</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we are extremely bad students of envy. We start to envy certain individuals in their entirety, when in fact, if we took a moment to analyse their lives calmly, we would realise that it was only a small part of what they had done that really resonates with, and should guide, our own next steps.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might not be the whole of the restaurant entrepreneur’s life we want, but really just their skill at building up institutions. Or we might not truly want to be a potter (when we think more closely about it), and yet we might need a little more of the playfulness on display in the work of one example we read about in a Sunday supplement. What we’re in danger of forgetting is that the qualities we admire don’t just belong to one specific, very attractive life. They can be pursued in lesser, weaker (but still real) doses in countless other places, opening up the possibility of creating many smaller, more manageable and more realistic versions of the lives we desire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we have sucked all the goodness from envy, we also have to acknowledge that there will be limits to its benefits. We need to know both how to use it and at other points, how to quieten its pangs. Too many random reminders of other people’s success too soon may simply terrify us into inactivity and unwittingly prevent us from putting any single plan into practice. We leap from target to target without knowing how to focus. In order to achieve anything on our own, we need to be free for extended stretches from the psychological pressures exerted by news of others’ feats. We require periods of inner seclusion and calm if we are ever going to finish off something worthwhile, that is, something that we may ourselves one day be envied for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to be able to postpone competition, to the moment when it can properly challenge us, rather than simply crush us. The student at a creative writing class who envies Hemingway or Nabokov is not going to be helped by the full intensity of the comparison between their writings and those of these masters. We need stretches of constructive inferiority – time to assess the scale of the mountain and to begin climbing with steady concentration. Envious rivalry, if it breaks in too soon, produces only despair and distraction.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlikely to be helpful if envy of them strikes too intensely in the first term</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also need to remind ourselves of statistical realities, because exposure to the media encourages us to forget them constantly. While the supplements are continuously filled with success stories, success itself will always remain highly anomalous, achieved by no more than a few thousand out of many millions – a detail that the media carefully (and sadistically) keeps carefully out of our imaginations. In contrast to what it suggests, most businesses in fact fail, most films don’t get made, most careers are not stellar, most people’s faces and bodies are less than perfectly beautiful and almost everyone is sad and worried a lot of the time. Mediocrity is the human norm. We shouldn’t lament our own condition just because it doesn’t measure up against deeply unrealistic benchmarks, or hate ourselves solely for our inability to defy some breathtaking odds.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">About as likely as being struck by lightning</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another crucial strategy – to lessen the grip in which envy holds us – is to understand more accurately and fully what the success of others depends upon. Perhaps these envied figures are not as much like you as they seem to be. Your sense of equality – responsible for much of your agony – may be misplaced. When you meet the target of your envy at a party or see them in jeans in a glossy magazine, they do of course seem very ‘normal’ and dangerously like you. But, in fact, they may have a highly unusual brain adept at synthesising vast amounts of financial data in ingenious ways. They might have a PhD in mechanical engineering. Or they are driven to work eighteen hours a day. Or they have a ruthless streak, which you are fundamentally not capable of or interested in. An anti-equality argument stresses that success often comes down to a raft of qualities which one has forgotten one doesn’t possess. The haunting thought – why them, why not me? – should therefore no longer invite simply self-torture and panic. It should instead edge us towards admiration. There are in truth real differences between oneself and the envied person. One isn’t really their equal. It isn’t just laziness, bad luck or some kind of persecutory force that explains our situation. We may arrive at the sane realisation that, when viewed dispassionately, certain accomplishments are truly beyond us. We can become appreciative spectators, rather than disappointed rivals, of those who have accomplished great things.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Typically, envious feelings swirl around unexamined. We carry them about guiltily but blindly. This gives rise to outbursts of bad temper directed at innocent bystanders (especially one’s partner); the sneaking hope that something bad is going to befall the person we envy and a sullen sense that one’s life is second-rate. But rather than repress the experience of envy, we should undertake a Philosophical Exercise to a) focus it and b) lend it perspective.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4216" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia.jpg?resize=635%2C375" alt="Jheronimus_Bosch_Table_of_the_Mortal_Sins_Invidia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things, Jheronimus Bosch, 1500</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The exercise below needs about 10 minutes to carry out. The questions and tasks are prompts. They’re not all going to be relevant. They won’t cure envy in one swoop. But they seek to reduce its trauma and start us on the path of dealing better with a powerful and difficult feature of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step One: Acknowledgement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s so unpleasant to admit to envy, we rarely do it head on, even to ourselves. Therefore, under the heading I admit I am envious of  …, make a list of the people who have recently triggered the emotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Woman who lives in that house in Well Walk</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gina (at the tennis club)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blunt declaration can be deeply freeing in itself. It is an admission, counter to neo-Christian moralism, that one is daily riven by envy and that this is profoundly normal, and even a sign of health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Two: Accuracy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For each person, write down the obvious immediate reason why their life seems to be terrific:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: read about him in the newspaper this weekend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A: seems to have some big job in TV.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: has 250 shops around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it can seem as if we want to be exactly like the person we envy. We want to have their life, pure and simple. And yet our circumstances, aptitudes and needs are likely to be extremely different from their own, even though we do still need to learn something from them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Try to identify one or more reasons why it would be odd, impossible or even quite undesirable for you actually to be the person you envy:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: I am not an actor and would hate to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A.: I hate the world of TV.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: I have no interest in communications businesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But your envy isn’t crazy. There is something real that you are latching on to, it’s just a question of pinning it down a little more accurately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So now look again at the names on your list, and try to find a small but significant thing that it is genuinely realistic to admire and to want to learn from:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: he has managed to be popular and cheerful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A.: she seems decisive and unburdened by anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: the idea of being creative for oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You should now have converted a PERSON into a set of ADJECTIVES:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Simon: popular/cheerful</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">G.A: unanxious, decisive</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Guy who had that phone business: creative, independent</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Three: Picturing your future Self</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ask yourself what you would need to do to infuse your present life with the qualities you have identified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Complete the following sentence with all the people on your list:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From [person X] I envy, I could realistically learn…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resist the impulse to denigrate those you envy. Settle into the position of a student of your own envy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Step Four: Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels like you are deeply equal to the people you envy. But in what way are you not in fact their equal? What genuine qualities do they have which you lack?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fill in the following sentence:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels like I am equal to X because… (I am the same age/gender/nationality…)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I am not equal to X because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Questions/tasks</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Every life is incomplete: what do you think the people you envy might envy?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What do you think are the statistical chances of accomplishing what the person you envy has accomplished? How common is this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Imagine turning envy into admiration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- In what way is it reasonable enough that you might not have got this thing, given how things are…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Imagine someone who likes you describing how you are OK, even quite admirable, without the thing they envy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Name as many things as you can that you craved in the past and then acquired, but which failed to improve your life as much as you had anticipated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Contemplate one of these images of planets far from our own:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost every developed nation boasts of having a rather unusual institution at its centre: a state broadcaster. These state broadcasters receive taxpayer’s money on the basis that they serve the public interest in a way that commercial broadcasters never can. In exchange for our cash, they frequently broadcast shows about ancient history and documentaries about endangered species.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/previous.presstv.ir/photo/20121118/rasouli_amir20121118084018007.jpg?resize=650%2C365" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept behind such institutions sounds plausible, but in truth, there’s terrible confusion about what they should really be doing &#8211; and in the process, societies squander a lot of opportunities to increase their well-being.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.radiotimes.com/uploads/images/original/43665.jpg?resize=647%2C432" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to tackle the many appalling problems they face, modern governments have developed levers they can pull to adjust behaviours. Most obviously, they have the law. They also have the tax system, health policy, and school and university curricula. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In relation to some of the big challenges, government levers work extremely well. But in relation to others, the results are patchy at best. There’s one crucial area where they hardly seem to work at all. A large, arguably even the largest, share of the issues undermining advanced nations are what one call ‘psychological’ at their root, that is, they have to do with our minds, with our deeper patterns of thinking and feeling. These problems include: family breakdown, domestic violence, poor parenting, alcoholism, drug addiction, obesity,  depression, chronic anxiety, delinquency and loneliness. Taken together, these 10 issues cost national governments an overwhelming share of their annual national budgets.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2763/4120236025_fac3949f45_b.jpg" alt="" width="564" height="374" /></p>
<p>Currently, there is no easy way for governments to address these problems. At best, they tinker with the odd ghoulish public advertising campaign, try to add on a class about this or that onto the school curriculum, play around with the tax system, give advice to social services, trial a bit of subsidised psychotherapy, print leaflets about parenting &#8211; and hope for the best.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the results tend to be very poor, because better relationships aren’t really fostered by a change in tax law, few people read leaflets, there’s not much money for public service ad campaigns and it’s naive at best to imagine that you can address large-scale social issues by tacking on talks to 16 year olds in schools on Friday afternoons.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/bpec.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/dc1.jpg?resize=654%2C436" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>In order to stand any chance of addressing national psychological ills, you have to get into people’s minds on a huge scale, with charm and skill, at regular, repeated intervals. This is where the tantalising opportunity lies. Just within reach of most governments, available for no extra money, stands the most powerful lever imaginable: the state broadcaster. Broadcasting truly works, it’s the single most effective way of changing mentalities, a million times more helpful than a book, leaflet or class. Revolutionaries have always known that; it’s why they always drive the tanks to the TV station first.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000T2AkqHQ4BOA/s/600/480/Egypt-Revolution-Day-05-024.jpg?resize=600%2C400" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, state broadcasters are aware that they should be making programmes that foster ‘the public good.’ But they’re desperately vague about what the public good really constitutes. At times they seem to hit the mark, but more by accident than conscious design. The dominant conception of public good seems unhelpfully bound up with broadcasting shows about the high arts &#8211; though very few nations are in fact undermined because not enough of the population know about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">La Traviata</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Wagner’s Ring Cycle.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/1.bp.blogspot.com/-CUrqwpVpcMY/VMAbvd-_xXI/AAAAAAAAFL4/GmoI-kJd8LE/s1600/15_Tosca_eb_-750.jpg?resize=547%2C444" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Governments should redefine what the public good actually means. They know what it is because they have &#8211; via their statistical offices &#8211; incontrovertible evidence about what the public bad is. Their statisticians constantly tell them the figures on obesity, drug addiction and broken families. Public broadcasters should therefore be charged with a simple mission: annually orienting all their output to addressing the 10 leading social problems statistically undermining their nations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This threatens to sound horribly worthy. Wall-to-wall programmes about obesity and family breakdown? Surely no one would watch! One imagines excruciatingly tedious shows by egg-head psychotherapists. But that’s precisely not what the mission would be. The challenge wouldn’t be (as now) to make the odd unpopular programme about important things; but to turn out consistently compelling work that tackles the most vital themes.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/23500000/Jo-Frost-supernanny-23526604-624-351.jpg?resize=624%2C351" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>This is what tax payers’ money would really be paying for: to foster the genius required to create brilliant mass entertainment, the very best comedies, dramas, game-shows and documentaries, about the most salient issues. To date, this has only been done sporadically, more by luck than design. The challenge would be to generate this material with institutional consistency.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cf2.foodista.com/sites/default/files/styles/featured/public/field/image/jamie%20oliver_7.jpg?resize=607%2C400" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>To say that programming should keep the national good in view still leaves the creative remit extremely broad. With a little thought, one can use pretty much any material &#8211; a game show, a cookery programme &#8211; to explore and find solutions for the great problematic themes of existence. At the headline level, the subject matter doesn&#8217;t need to be in any way different. What counts is the way the material is handled. The story of a married woman who has an affair, does drugs and throws herself under a train can be a lurid article in the Daily Mail &#8211; or<em> Anna Karenina</em>. It all has to do with the moral intention that&#8217;s brought to the work. The newspaper has no end in view other than to alarm and shock us; Tolstoy is out to heal us.</p>
<p>Properly done, state broadcasting could dramatically start to change the mood of the nation. What one had seen on TV would affect how parents spoke to children and children spoke to parents, how lovers behaved, how one would respond to anxiety and deal with loneliness. With enough creativity applied, public broadcasting could do more to cure the ills of nations than the police force, social services and the drugs squad combined. A huge opportunity is at hand, waiting for the necessary political will, intellectual focus and creative talent to develop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern societies are deeply invested in the idea of big, glamorous weddings. We have evolved highly-detailed collective ideas about what a proper wedding is supposed to be like, down to the specialised floral arrangements, seat covers, presents for bridesmaids and the correct order of the speeches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1278" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486957427.jpg" alt="I do." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These belong to our culture’s current way of expressing the notion that a wedding is an important event in terms of the success of a marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the results don’t seem very encouraging: the link between the quality of the wedding and that of the subsequent relationship is tenuous at best. However grand the ceremony might be, marriages break down at an alarming – yet predictable – rate.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we know as the wedding day emerged historically out of a variety of motives: it was an event designed to show off one’s status, to embed one in the community, to invite God to witness one’s union… These ambitions don’t now feel particularly relevant. Therefore, it’s sometimes argued that we don’t need wedding ceremonies at all. Let’s junk the whole idea. We don’t need to waste so much money and go to so much trouble. A piece of paper at the registry office would be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this seems to overlook the benefit of rituals. In theory, rituals serve a hugely important function, for they orchestrate and give public expression to a sequence of emotions and actions that it would be too tricky for any one set of individuals to arrive at on their own. They give structure to interior life – and best reveal their advantages in religious rituals like the Jewish Day of Atonement or the period of mourning known as ‘iddah’ following a Muslim funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90982750.jpg" alt="Ultra-Orthodox Jews Perform Tashlich Ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that the wedding day is – in its current form – an appallingly badly designed ritual. It needs a thorough overhaul, guided by a mature, modern understanding of the underlying purpose of the occasion, which is simply to help a marriage go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, redesigning wedding days sounds odd. We fully accept redesigns and novelty when it comes to technology. No one would think it was a good idea to keep driving a hundred-year-old car. Yet when we’re dealing with social practices, we strangely cling to the ancient with deluded fervour.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do so out of fear: because marriage is such an uncertain business, we quell our anxieties by following what people have always done, attempting to insure ourselves against some new follies we might commit, but thereby ignoring that marriages have been rather catastrophic throughout history and therefore that sticking stubbornly to precedent has all the wisdom of adhering to the methods of medieval plumbing or brain surgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In redesigning the wedding day, we should wipe the slate clean and ask simply: what kind of ceremony would help a marriage to survive? How could one design a day that would make a proper contribution to the maintenance of a union?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The need for new vows</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vows are promises we make on behalf of people who don’t yet exist about circumstances that we can’t yet fully imagine. Still, they serve an important function in at least attempting to guide our responses to the tensions of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with current vows is their optimism, which should be radically tempered, so as to avoid rage and resentment. Vows should accurately anticipate what will make us want to get divorced – and confirm to us that our subsequent sadness will not be an unusual or personal curse. Here is a selection of vows that would be made by a couple in the utopia:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I accept that I am – in countless ways I don’t yet know – very hard to live with.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>We accept not to panic when, some years from now, what we are doing today will seem like the worst decision of our lives.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When you are mean, when you call me a c*** and a fucking bastard, I will strive to remember that at heart, it is because you are hurt – not that you are fundamentally nasty.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Everyone has some very significant things wrong with them. We promise not to look around. There isn’t anyone better out there really. Once you get to know them, everyone is impossible.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1282" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158035124.jpg" alt="Same-Sex Couples Legally Wed in Seattle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Being allowed never to insert one’s penis into a new person, or have someone else new insert their penis into oneself, is one of the tragedies of existence. I apologise that my jealousy and your jealousy have made this peculiar, but entirely necessary self-immolation necessary.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Silence from the audience, followed by a melancholy rendition of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater, during which an asparagus and a lemon, symbols of free sexuality are buried in a three-metre-deep hole in the ground covered with marble or concrete.]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple then repeats: <i>We accept to witness the slow death of our sexuality. We realise we won’t be doing it that often from now on.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I won’t have affairs, not because you’re so perfect, but because I’ve decided to be disappointed by you, and you alone, and you’ll be disappointed by me, and me alone, rather than both of us foisting our troubled selves on innocent members of the community, who would be deeply annoying too once one got to know them.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>[In unison with the audience] Many days we’ll be unhappy; many days, we’ll suffer, many days we’ll regret we ever did this crazy thing. It’s not congratulations we need, it’s commiserations.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Lots of guests</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a growing trend, often driven by financial concerns, towards slightly smaller weddings but a big crowd is, in fact, supremely important (even if the budget only stretches to a sandwich for them later).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One needs a maximum number of people there for a simple reason: so as to cause maximum embarrassment in years to come at the idea of having to call them all up and announce news of divorce. The larger the crowd, the slower one will be to pick up the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/120209645.jpg" alt="Guests arrive for the wedding between En" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This gives due recognition to an important fact about marriage: it’s a social institution, in which we often stay for reasons that go way beyond our own emotional desires. It involves us, but it’s not just about us. It’s about the dog, the children, the grandparents, the friends who got married in imitation of us and whose own relationships would suffer if we split… This sense it isn’t just about us should come as a huge source of relief. There’s nothing harder than to be required to be happy in and for ourselves. What relief to know we will, with time, also be living for others and that our own frame of mind won’t always be such a big deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Different sorts of presents</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian Wedding, the guests would offer the couple different sorts of presents. Primarily, they would arrive with accounts of why their own marriages were difficult and why they were themselves awkward people to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1284" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76590233.jpg" alt="Wedding Ceremony Of Hong Kong Actor Lawrence Ng Kai Wah" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing makes us happier than news of the troubles of others, as these presents would implicitly recognise. At dark moments in the marriage, one would turn to these gifts and flip through descriptions of the marital troubles of one’s friends and relatives – and would come away feeling that one was cursed certainly, but – importantly – in no way alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If single guests were unable to produce such things, they would arrive with vouchers for couples’ therapy, to contribute to the enormous sum that will have to be spent on therapy over the lifetime of any decent marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Speeches</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A typical marriage recognises the key role of parents and gives them a platform. The father of the bride often makes an elaborate speech telling the world how great his daughter is. This is sweet, but in no way protects the daughter he claims to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1285" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1284280a.jpg" alt="USA Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/West Coast Surfer/Mood Board</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents are in command of some vital information that can help a marriage. They know how disturbed they themselves are and the particular family patterns of emotional neuroses which they have witnessed and then unleashed on their own children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wedding day offers a stellar opportunity for the parents of both the bride and the groom to stand up and address their children and their friends on the subject of: ‘The particular ways in which we have messed up the children.’ There would be an added speech on the topic of: ‘How we think our children will be hard to live with, given what we know of them.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This will be crucial information, far surpassing childhood photos and home movies in utility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: A certificate of marriage worthiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, you would get married by a philosopher/psychoanalyst (rather than the two useless current figures, a priest or a local government official). The wedding ceremony would be a passing out celebration for a couple who had been through a substantial course (no less than 12 months) of self-knowledge and mutual education in the psychology of relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic culture suggests that relationships are essentially founded on emotional states: like tenderness, the feeling of missing the other person and sexual passion. This is evidently reckless and in the utopia, there would be a new more logical, classical approach which would recommend strenuous conscious attempts to achieve a mature understanding of love. Many of the skills of marriage would overlap with those of a bomb disposal expert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1286" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/71083487.jpg" alt="Atomic Cake" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the wedding day would be like a graduation ceremony, a culmination of a year of intense study of one of the trickiest and most academic subjects in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Symbols</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The symbols currently associated with marriage (silver horseshoes, bells, white dresses, confetti) can seem to fall somewhere between the merely charming and the obviously superstitious. Few people feel a bridal veil offers robust protection against evil spirits. It’s tempting to think we should jettison symbolism entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the point of a symbol is to make an idea stick in your mind. In the Utopia, the couple would accept small sealed boxes from each other. The box would represent the idea that there will be parts of the other person one will not understand – or perhaps even know – and yet one will have to accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4316" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="William Holden Hiding Present From Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The box would be accompanied by a ‘Tolstoy’ – a brief, but very honest, confession of one’s failings and weaknesses. The Russian novelist gave his wife a written account of his earlier sexual life and an ample description of the flaws of his character, so she would know what she was letting herself in for. The content would be prepared and discussed in the lead up to the marriage; the book would stand for the willingness to listen to – and bear with – one’s partner’s troubles. The exchange of Tolstoys would symbolise a shared ability to cope with the other person’s confusion and distress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Wedding photos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of photos is to bottle the essence of the wedding and make it available to us when we need it later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1288" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1042074x-1.jpg" alt="Carolyn and Fabio wed in the remote village of Airor on the Knoydart Peninsula in the Scottish Highlands, Britain  - 11 Nov 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a wedding album should not only or even primarily be a visual record of a particular day, and evidence of who was in attendance. The task of the photographer is to create a series of works of art, made on many days, and perhaps not at all on the day of the wedding itself, that would remind the couple of answers to some key questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(i) Why did we get together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(ii) What virtues did we see in one another when we got married?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iii) What impact does each person’s family have on the relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iv) How normal are marital problems in society at large?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking back at one’s ‘wedding photos’ in subsequent years would then take its place within the overall purpose of the wedding: it would help, in a small way, to persuade us to stay married.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a wedding – and the elaborate rituals that surround it – do not at present have our real needs in focus. But that doesn’t mean to say that we’d be better off jettisoning the whole ceremony. We still need ceremony and institutions, just better ones. We should take very seriously – and be collectively ambitious about – what wedding days could and should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian thinking sounds like dreamy stuff. But in truth, one of the uses of Utopian thinking is to move us away from silly fantasy. Instead of seeing the ‘dream wedding’ in terms of palm trees and infinity pools, we should be asking what a wedding would be like if it properly helped marriages to go better. That should give us inspiration as we set about reforming the mediocre marriage practices we currently have</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We generally hold culture – by which we understand art, museums, cinema, literature and the study of history – in extremely high regard. But, equally, we tend not to look very closely at why culture has such prestige. In fact, we are encouraged to think it is unsophisticated, even vulgar, to ask what culture is <i>for</i>. And yet, as it will be argued here, this is a question that no society should shun – for an enormous task lies before culture if only it can become conscious of its true purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7832" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7602184642_a7d04ed6ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The present ‘guardians of culture’ – art and literary critics employed by media organisations, professors in the humanities and museum curators – are deeply devoted to the idea that art should exist ‘for art’s sake.’ This idea achieved dominance in the late nineteenth century and continues to determine the frame through which we (largely unknowingly) view culture. It dictates that culture should never be appropriated for practical or ideological ends. The theory was meant to release culture from the clutches of three tainted forces – religion, politics and commerce – each of which was deemed to want something rather too urgent and practical from cultural creators. In flight from these forces, critics asserted that culture was to be kept free of any sort of clearly stated ‘goal’ or ‘end’. It should exist in its own sphere and not be asked to ‘do’ anything much in the world (as religions, political parties and certain pre-modern societies, especially those of Greece and Rome, had explicitly asked it to). On the back of this idea were born all kinds of notions that persist to this day: the veneration of ambiguity and paradox (witnessed in elite discussions of contemporary art), the disdain for clear unironic ideological pronouncements on the part of artists as to their role in society (compare the suspicion directed at Tolstoy’s rallying cries compared with the elite enthusiasm for Marina Abramovic’s gnomic pronouncements), the preference for studying the formal qualities of literary texts as opposed to their meaning (it sounds absurd to suppose that Proust might change our lives), the ridicule directed at anyone who might study history ‘to learn lessons from the past’ (which was the whole pre-modern point of history) and the constant assertions that the point of culture is merely to raise questions rather than find answers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7830" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg?resize=400%2C567" alt="L.N.Tolstoy_Prokudin-Gorsky" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It should be added that this is not generally how artists themselves have seen their purpose. George Eliot, Nietzsche, Van Gogh, Heidegger, Picasso and George Orwell, to name but a few, would all have begged to differ. The point is that the guardians of culture in whose hands their work rests have carefully stripped these voices of their more urgent and utilitarian aims.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, however, the idea of culture as a practical force would be taken very seriously indeed. It would be recognised what a historical anomaly the idea of ‘art for art’s sake’ has been, running counter to centuries of historic mainstream thinking about the purpose of art. Almost all the art and culture that is to be found in museums, art galleries and libraries was produced by people who believed that art had a purpose which could be stated thus: it was meant to teach us how to be wise, self-aware, kind and reconciled to the darkest aspects of reality. The anti-utilitarian view is a rejection of more than 2,000 years of philosophising on the practical role of the arts.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was Aristotle who shaped the mindset of the West by proposing that watching tragedies was first and foremost <i>useful</i> – useful in shaking us free of self-righteousness, prejudice and moral blindness. In the amphitheatres of Attica, one would be invited to see how easily a hero might make a small error and then pay a huge price for it, a spectacle that would induce fear and pity in audiences, leaving them readier to forgive others and better able to examine their own consciences. As Nietzsche emphasised in his <i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> (a powerful rehearsal of the Greek argument as to the utility of the arts), Aristotle insists that drama should be entrusted with the core social role of educating the emotions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Likewise, in the 19th century, Hegel rejected the idea of ‘art for art’s sake’, proposing that painting, music, architecture, literature and design all had major missions to perform. We need them, he suggested, so that important insights can become properly powerful in our lives. Art is ‘the sensuous presentation of ideas’. The point of art, Hegel, realises, is not so much to come up with startlingly new or strange ideas; but to take the good, important, helpful thoughts we often already know and make them stick in our minds.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, culture would be given a single, ambitious role: to function as a form of therapy. The various branches of culture would serve the same purpose in different ways: they would all compensate for our natural weaknesses and emotional frailties, they would guide, correct and encourage us, they would open our eyes and console us for our griefs, so that with their help we might become better versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently, there is almost always a knee-jerk response on the part of critics to suggestions of the therapeutic within the cultural sphere: ‘The idea that art should help people to live is a piece of babyish absurdity we should all have grown out of long ago’ according to a statement in the<i>Guardian</i>;  ‘Reducing art to self-help is the greatest imaginable insult to the masterpieces of culture’ echoed the <i>New York Times</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4513954866_2f34b3e251_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7828" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4513954866_2f34b3e251_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4513954866_2f34b3e251_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the problem is that we’ve become confused about the basic meaning of the word therapy. A therapy is a treatment intended to help a person to function well. It might be a medical therapy: a vaccination that strengthens our resistance to disease or an intervention that cures an ailment. But equally, the idea of therapy applies to the mind. Therapy, in this core sense, is the deliberate attempt to help us to lead better lives. To suggest that a person does not stand in need of the therapeutic flies in the face of everything we know about human psychology in general – and ourselves in particular.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of art for art’s sake was originally motivated by a noble desire to honour culture, to say how special and important its fields were in a world sullied by meaner, utilitarian aims. Yet, inadvertently, this entrenched view has come to stand in the way of a full engagement with culture, suggesting that its disciplines should not in fact be consequential in the world; that they should not guide our beliefs or shape our habits; that they should not be appreciated for their wisdom or consoling power – for this would be to ‘use’ them…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4318" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain.png?resize=635%2C509" alt="The_Peacock_Room_-_The_Princess_from_the_Land_of_Porcelain" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the prestige which culture currently enjoys has been won at the expense of another field of human experience, the status of which has declined in direct relation to the rise in the status of art: religion. From the middle of the 19th century onwards, many people (Matthew Arnold, Nietzsche, Heidegger among them) came to the view that, as religion weakened its hold on society and upon people’s inner lives, it would be culture that could step in and perform many of the same roles as the faiths. Culture too could guide, exhort, reassure, console, inspire and censure. It was with this big ambition in mind that a period of vast investment in culture (in museums, in art galleries, in opera houses and libraries) proceeded. Culture would replace scripture. The great institutions of culture – the galleries and the universities – would be the new Cathedrals of Christendom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In truth, art really can do for us a remarkable number of the very things that religion once did. Culture truly is in a position to replace many of the functions of scripture. Art too has the power to console us, it too can bring meaning and purpose, it too can increase our powers of empathy and generate a sense of community.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in practice, we tend to pay only lip-service to these ideas. You used to go to the cathedral for some clear reasons: because you wanted to save your soul, because you were looking for comfort, you needed community, you wanted to develop your moral character or you were hoping for consolation and redemption. But if you turned up at a gallery or a university arts faculty with similarly intense, focused concerns, you would be considered very strange, regarded with suspicion and perhaps even declared insane.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, in a wise and mature society, the therapeutic resources of culture would be taken very seriously. The visual arts, architecture, the humanities, galleries and museums would be deployed to help us cope with our troubles and to flourish, both individually and collectively.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In universities, the past would no longer be studied under the banner of ‘history’, novels would not be read in ‘literature’ courses, there wouldn’t be a category called ‘art history’. Instead, students would enrol in classes whose psychological purpose was evident, perhaps ones with titles like <i>The Role of Error</i>; <i>The Need for Status</i>; <i>The Sorrows of Love </i>and <i>The Challenges of Mortality</i>. Art galleries would similarly be reorganised to track our true needs. Instead of grouping works according to where they happened to have been produced and when, they would be grouped according to the human needs they best addressed. Instead of a room devoted to 18th-century French painting, one would find ones titled <i>Anxiety </i>or<i> Envy</i>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Utopian government would be similarly ambitious for film, the most influential of all art forms. It would, for example, focus on the classification of films. Instead of just suggesting that one needed to be above a particular age to watch a film, the government classification board would see its primary task as that of helping a film to reach the audiences it was in an optimal position to help. Thus a film might be rated A, meaning that it was regarded as being good at getting us to address and cope with Anxiety. Or it could have an MC rating, meaning that it was of benefit to those experiencing Marital Conflict. In the Utopia, films would be expected not only to entertain us (and ease the pains of long flights), they would be appreciated – and used – for their ability to better direct our feelings of sympathy, offer comfort for our unmanageable fears, correct an unworkable sense of what is normal, edge us towards good conduct and arm us against our follies and vices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key concerns, in the Utopian society, would be with topping up the therapeutic effects of cultural experiences. Our insights fade. It may be that at 8am, having just had a cup of coffee and walked across the park from the station to work, we are ready to look with patience on the flaws of our colleagues; but by midday this benign attitude may have become seriously frayed. An ideal society would be acutely aware of this risk, so it would make sure that we were likely to encounter reminders at regular points through the day – as religions once did. When we nipped out to get a sandwich at lunchtime, we might be confronted by a work of art articulating themes of kindness and empathy. Or we might participate in a quick cloud-watching event, restoring (briefly) a more mature perspective on the harried demands of the afternoon.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, and to put it with deliberate bluntness, the great works of culture amount to a giant ‘how to’ manual that a society writes for itself. At present, the manual has been muted and its power fatefully constrained. The messages we hear most days have been written by advertisers and corporations – while the guardians of culture have prevented their medium from shaping mass consciousness, fearful that culture’s supposed commitment to ambiguity and paradox might be damaged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the future, the resources of the public environment – buildings, institutions, events and educators – would ideally all be organised for the sake of helping us to lead better lives, guided by a recognition of the real troubles we face and by a grand and ancient ambition that culture should support our better natures.</span></p>

It is for us what theatre was in the age of Shakespeare or painting was in the days of Leonardo da Vinci: the art form with the biggest impact, the largest budgets, the most widespread audiences.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4604851744_70133c1daa_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7793" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4604851744_70133c1daa_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4604851744_70133c1daa_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collectively, we recognise that film has an astonishing power to induce emotion: it can reliably make millions of us weep, feel terror or relief, be elevated or downcast. It is a massive engine for getting and holding our attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it would sound very weird to stop and ask what film was really for, what purpose it serves in our societies and why we spend so much time in its presence. That’s because we don’t generally think of films as serving any very strenuous or serious cause. We might point out that films aim to be great entertainment, make money at the box office and – occasionally – present us with a controversial idea. We ask for a lot of nice but not terribly consequential things of films: to while away the hours of an intercontinental flight, to keep the family together on the sofa, to give us a bit of a thrill…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7838" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="5971647111_0ae3e0dc27_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is reflected in the way we typically categorise films according to nothing more profound than the basic premise of their storylines (adventure, fantasy, disaster, road, sci-fi etc.) or according to the general emotions they produce: comedy, horror, romance. Or we take note of the kind of audiences at which they seem aimed: chick flick, guys’ films, women’s weepers, family-oriented…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this is a great loss for us and for cinema itself. Watching films has become so profoundly familiar in our society, we have lost sight of just how strange, remarkable and consequential this activity truly is. We have come to take cinema so for granted, we don’t wonder how we might use it to benefit our lives in a properly profound way. Ideally, we would get more ambitious about the role of cinema in the world. We would try to pin down more accurately what films can actually do for us, then make sure we’re reliably making, and finding our way to seeing, the best (that is, the most useful) kinds of films: the films that really do help us with our struggles and pains. We would, ideally, learn that film – like all the other art forms – best reveals its power when we conceive of it as a kind of therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This idea isn’t new. It comes from the Ancient Greeks who brought maturity to the predecessor of cinema: theatre. Fascinatingly, they didn’t just file going to the theatre under ‘entertainment’ and leave it at that. They thought very deeply about what the point of sitting in a theatre might be and concluded that it should be a <i>therapeía</i>, a resource to help us grow into better, wiser, more mature kinds of people. It belonged, together with religion and philosophy, to the forces that could develop our souls. Aristotle proposed that watching tragedies was highly useful in shaking us free of self-righteousness. Seeing how easily a hero might make a small error and then pay a huge price for it could induce fear and pity in the audience, leaving us readier to forgive others and better able to examine our own consciences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4650613871_c4b61defc3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7817" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4650613871_c4b61defc3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="4650613871_c4b61defc3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to film, we should get back to the practical spirit of the Ancient Greeks. We too should learn to assign functions to films according to their specific capacities. Films have it in their power to compensate us for a range of weaknesses in our nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider six key problems – and how films might be of help:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem One: We take our troubles too seriously</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are understandably prone to self-pity; we get ground down and frustrated by the problems life throws at us. And we tend to react by insisting in ever more rigid and solemn ways on the necessary correctness of our own outlook. We can be hard to live with, lonely, defensive, proud and brittle inside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1265" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3878176i.jpg" alt="Archipelago - 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Kino International/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certain films can beautifully address this natural tendency when they show us people not too different from ourselves in difficult situations which feel rather familiar. It’s someone a bit like us who is dealing with spouses, the challenges of dating, money worries, travelling for business, health anxieties, bosses, children, in-laws… Except, very much unlike us, a film can play these for laughs. It seeks the absurd side of the exact things we normally greet with excessive seriousness. The film attempts to do something wonderfully useful (and very hard): teach us to laugh at ourselves and restore perspective to our troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At their best, there’s nothing trivial about these comedies at all. They take on the momentous task of sweetly edging us towards being slightly nicer to live around.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Two: We’re not careful enough</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a terrible, occasional trauma of life that some actions that seem quite small go on to have horrible consequences. You tell a little lie. You steal a tiny bit. You’re a bit dishonest with someone. You get a bit lustful and carried away, just once… And then, from this, problems can grow and spiral into catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Films can help us by speeding up time and showing us in a matter of hours the fearsome result of what we might originally have thought of as small failings. A film can push the consequences to the maximum: it shows what happens when trust is eroded in a relationship, when an enemy is vindictively crushed (rather than spared), when one tries to deny something another person knows…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1266" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3659754k.jpg" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - Jan 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Moviestore</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The film can provide us not only with alarm bells. By witnessing horror and disaster, it can make us want to be the kind of person who is a touch more forthright, a little more honest and moral, readier to face an unpleasant moment now and (thereby) head off a distant disaster. We leave the cinema less inclined to be self-righteous about the failings of others, scared for ourselves and more respectful towards things we hold dear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Three: Ordinary life seems boring</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might sound odd, but it’s usually very healthy and helpful to feel that one’s life is a bit special; deserving of admiration and respect, a little glamorous. But very often, the opposite is the case. Glamour lies elsewhere: in the lives of the famous, in swankier parts of town, in activities and jobs far removed from our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film has an enormous power to glamourise. It can put in front of our eyes delightful images many metres in size, shot in extraordinary colours, vivid and immediate. Because so many films glamourise the wrong things, we’re used to thinking that an element of alienation and corruption is a generic rather than an incidental danger of cinema.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1267" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2014102i.jpg" alt="'Happy-Go-Lucky' Film - 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Snap Stills</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in fact, film is well able to show us the less obvious but real charms of everyday life. Whereas the worst sort of films eject us back into our lives full of longing and disenchantment, the best ones leave us ready to re-engage with circumstances with which we had unfairly grown bored. Cinema can help us love and appreciate what we already have. It might be a film about an ordinary school teacher who we, the audience, realise is delightful; we see the deep charm of the sandwich lunch she has looking out at a beautiful patch of grass near a motorway junction. We’re moved when, on Saturday, she buys a new lampshade. There’s a fabulous episode when she buys an old car and goes camping in North Yorkshire. We’re taught how to see the very real dignity and grace of ordinary life. And we recognise that a little of that, fairly, belongs to us as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Four: Other cultures are weird and scary</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not entirely our own fault. The media is to blame for much of it, for it tells us about categories of people we want to have nothing to do with, places that seem frightening, bizarre, scary, unremittingly depressing. We grow to think we’re not at all interested in people in Iran or Venezuela, a local sink estate or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Our disenchantment may get expressed as racism or class arrogance – or, just plain coldness. Ultimately, what we suffer from is a denial of our common humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1268" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1128692a-1.jpg" alt="'Ten' film - 2002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/c. Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema can perfectly compensate for this withdrawal of emotional energy by showing us the appeal of people we’d otherwise be uninterested in. One might be shown the sweet manners of a family living in abject poverty a few miles east of our own home; or a woman making the best of it in Tehran, finding ways of supporting her family and displaying a bravery and loyalty we can relate to. We are offered insights into ways in which – close up – people elsewhere might be very similar to oneself, even over there, in Kinshasa or Nairobi. They might fuss in the same way, or be offended by the same things that bother you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the highest artistry, we’re reminded of an obvious but so easily forgotten fact: our membership of the family of man.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Five: Excessive timidity, failure of ambition and nerve</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve gone so far down the track of teaching ourselves about the importance of gentleness and compromise, many of us have unwittingly developed a problem around certain forms of self-assertion and resistance to the demands of others. Decent people have learned all too well to suppress their own appetite for a fight, their own desire for victory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in a world where conflict is unavoidable, good people sometimes need to strengthen their willingness to face down opposition – not always to compromise and play it safe, but to take risks instead, to get out and fight, to relish victory and to be a bit more ruthless in the service of noble and deeply important ends. Sometimes it is not enough to be right, you also need to win.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1269" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1547619a.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Moviestore Collection</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So some of us might well benefit from seeing films that tell tales of heroism: that follow someone who has to navigate the world, kill a dragon, outwit some baddies, penetrate a corrupt organisation… The film shouldn’t ideally leave us just in awe at the daring of another. It should do that far more valuable thing: educate us by example so that we too become just a little more heroic and brave where we need to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Problem Six: Immaturity</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard to be an adult in the true sense. We’re immature in so many ways, as we recognise in our more honest moments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therefore, we desperately need accurate, yet bearable, representations of the process of development. We need the constant encouragement of seeing people mess up but then also come to important realisations, forgive, accept complex truths and act less selfishly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1270" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3755098e.jpg" alt="Boyhood - 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/c. IFC Films/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be a father who realises, three quarters of the way through the film, that he no longer wants to frighten and bully his children. Or a spouse who starts to acknowledge how much they have neglected their partner. Or an adolescent who accepts that he can’t always just blame others. Or a lover who gives up chasing those who are unavailable and punishing those who happen to love him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Film has the huge task of showing us how we might develop. It gives us role models, human and flawed as we are, who by example leave us a little more able to do what we need to, and yet fear to undertake, in our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Utopian conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically, governments acknowledge the power of cinema in two ways. They seek to foster the film industry by offering financial support and tax breaks. There is a potent – if not clearly defined – pride in having a thriving local film industry. It’s fed by the thought that cinema might in some way help us understand who we are or promote aspects of our better nature. And governments hope to limit any damage that films may do to the national psyche by classifying – and restricting who can view – material according to the level of violence, swearing and sexual activity it contains. This is a distant, tentative acknowledgment of a profound fact: we hope that cinema can be genuinely good for us, and help us live our lives; and we rightly worry that it also has the power to harm and damage us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema, as we currently know it, is not a million miles from doing wonderful things. But in order to help with the real business of living, we need this hugely compelling and powerful art form to set out in a more determined and systematic way to offer us the help we really need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8247213618_7cb9d21ece_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7795" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8247213618_7cb9d21ece_z.jpg?resize=635%2C296" alt="8247213618_7cb9d21ece_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Number 10</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The way we categorise films should ideally get a little more subtle. Rather than say something was merely a thriller or a comedy, we’d put the accent on what these genres might achieve for their audiences: we’d have a more secure sense of what particular life challenge a film was suited to addressing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of suggesting that one needs to be above a particular age to watch a film, the government classification board would see its primary task as that of helping a film to reach the audience it could best help. Thus a film might be rated A – meaning that it was regarded as being good at getting us to address and cope with Anxiety. Or it could have an MC rating: meaning that it was of benefit to those experiencing Marital Conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The classification would not so much recognise the overt content of the film. Rather it would be given in recognition of what should really always be at stake when we take in a movie: the therapeutic power of the work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Films can do so much for us:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they better direct our feelings of sympathy</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they offer comfort for our unmanageable fears</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they correct an unworkable sense of what is normal</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they edge us towards good conduct</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>they caution us, and arm us against our folly and vices.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Existing films do not entirely ignore these tasks: they circle round them and make hints but do not focus on them in a systematic or reliable way. In the Utopia, the top films would be:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. The portrayal of ‘an average marriage’ in its seventh year. The couple are deeply committed to each other but find themselves easily irritated, disappointed and at times hostile. The film would be widely praised for its highly realistic, extended argument scenes. This would be a ‘Feel Normal’ film.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1272" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3850678c.jpg" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/c. Kino Lorber/Everett</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. A high adventure film, not unlike James Bond, in which a serious and self-questioning character would, for example, thwart an international terrorist plot. The allure of such films would be traced to the encouragement they would give to integration: the ability to be effective as opposed to merely just nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. A narrative centred on the inner life of an accountant. It would belong to a highly regarded genre of ‘Looking at the Overlooked’. Another example would show the hidden drama and depth in the routines of a structural engineer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. There would be a very popular film set in a hospice, in which several of the leading characters would die. The film would be much liked for offering what would become known as ‘Perspective Moments’. These would help us see our own anxieties and stresses in more manageable proportions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1273" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2056121b.jpg" alt="Amour - 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cinema is deeply powerful. There’s still a way to go before society as a whole wakes up to what we should properly ask of it.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re used to the idea that a year should be punctuated by a sequence of special public days: Christmas, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, some kind of national day, May Day, the August Bank holiday etc.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we’re not – collectively – very ambitious about the role of such occasions. They can be charming, they can be sweet, they can be (at times) rather touching. But, on the whole, we don’t take them terribly seriously and don’t expect others to. We can easily become slightly cynical and see them in terms simply of added sales of cards and confectionary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1294" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156238289.jpg" alt="GERMANY-XMAS-CHRISTMAS-SANTA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This – however – is  a missed opportunity. The quiet scepticism we feel towards the existing calendar of festivals doesn’t show that public days have no powerful contribution to make to the development and maintenance of a good society. They’re evidence of a semi-conscious, and very accurate awareness, that we could do a lot better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In essence, festivals originated as solutions to collective problems. Trooping the Colour (one Saturday in June since 1748) is an event designed to relieve public worry about the army’s loyalty to the British sovereign. There was a time when it was clearly very important indeed for the British population as a whole to be able to witness soldiers demonstrating their allegiance to the crown (and not to a rival political faction). But as such reassurance falls low on the agenda of public needs, that public festival loses its real purpose. It remains picturesque but it (rightly) doesn’t feel as if it really matters. On an even grander scale, something similar has happened around Easter. Easter Sunday originated as as public festival of the triumph of divine love over death: Jesus had been crucified and restored to life on the third day; and the point of the occasion was to keep that world-altering event at the forefront of everyone’s mind. But as Christian dominion recedes in people’s inner lives, Easter Sunday becomes a charming, but unfocused, day of chocolate indulgence and painted eggs.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, there would still be public holidays, but they’d be thought through more rigorously, expressly designed to work a therapeutic, conciliatory effect on society as a whole. The idea of designing festivals automatically sets off alarm bells in the minds of a contemporary liberal audience, who have been taught to think of East Germany and Russia at this point – but these unfortunate examples should not persuade us that good public holidays are somehow designed by history or nature and can hence never be changed. Throughout the ages, people have expressly designed events: the challenge is to do it well, rather than insist it can’t be done at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are seven kinds of public holiday that might be evolved to address some of the core collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: National Pride</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1297" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144081759.jpg" alt="People with hands raised for We are the World ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely beneficial to be able to feel enthusiastic and committed to one’s society; to feel reassured by membership of an admirable community. Collective pride takes the burden of self-regard off the individual ego. We don’t have to do it all ourselves. We can belong to something better and greater than we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, pride is constantly undermined by a media that – quite rightly – wants to point out (and makes money from pointing out) just what is so wrong with our countries. It is easy to come away from the media believing that our societies are nothing but a narrow collection of violent maniacs, paedophiles, corrupt politicians and venal business people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1299" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/169763866.jpg" alt="BRITAIN-POLITCS-BNP-PROTEST" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1">The truth will, in the countries where this publication is predominantly being read (the United States, mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia and South Korea) be very different indeed. To spend a day focusing on what’s good shouldn’t sap the will for critical self-examination; it can be a vital corrective to an impulse simply to denigrate. It can stop us being so spoilt about the genuine but forgotten merits of our lands.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the emphasis should fall on the forgotten aspects of national accomplishment. The fear is always of jingoism and militarism, in other words, that we’ll feel proud of things that aren’t worthy of regard. Yet the fact that people have often felt proud of the wrong things shouldn’t be an argument against national pride per se. The desire to feel proud of the group is an ineradicable feature, and we ignore it at our peril. To castigate it merely leaves it unattended, prone to latch onto inappropriate targets. The challenge isn’t to banish pride, but to channel it in optimal directions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a utopia, a national day would focus not on the things people already identify as impressive. In Germany, for instance, there wouldn’t be a big celebration of their footballing excellence: it’s not needed. The Netherlands is not in urgent need of a day to remember how great it is at cultivating tulips. The United States needs no further reminders of its military strength.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather, it is those things which have a genuinely admirable side, but which we are prone to ignore or underplay that need encouragement. Thus the Dutch might have Normal Day on which they feel proud of their interest in a dignified ordinary life. The British, overwhelmed by the callousness, pessimism and cynicism of their national media, would celebrate their capacity for politeness, optimism and energy. The United States, so practiced at overwhelming power, would celebrate the local and the small-scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1301" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/98728064.jpg" alt="US President Barack Obama(C) visits a lo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than cheer at politicians or the fly-by of aircraft, national pride would be directed at things like the national electricity grid, parents with children under three, tunnelling engineers, locomotive drivers, accountants (and the forgotten good they perform), those everywhere who forbear and forgive, prisoners who repent, the makers of simple, honest household goods, cardiac surgeons…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The purpose of the national day shouldn’t be to celebrate what already goes quite well. It would be to highlight the fragile but best tendencies of the nation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Carnival</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most prosperous societies project powerful constraints on public behaviour. There is huge emphasis placed upon being responsible, reliable and in control of one’s desires. Particularly around sex. Energy and ambition have been channelled into work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are terrible costs to all this. Our picture of normality becomes crushing. It does not acknowledge the darker sides of our characters, it keeps us too tightly harnessed. Many of us therefore blow up at random moments. We can’t take the discipline any more. We do something a little crazy and can pay a very heavy price as a result.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good societies know about our more chaotic sides and are keen to channel rather than repress them. That is the function of Carnival in the Utopia. Carnival night would be a small moment in the year collectively devoted to the unconstrained libido.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1302" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/139113371.jpg" alt="Brazil Begins Carnival Celebration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After 3pm, everyone (however blissful their relationship) would be expected to get slightly drunk and to head out without their partner; all the clubs would have been commandeered for the night by the state; eye masks would be distributed on buses and trains. One would be encouraged to start talking to anyone at all, one could join a mass of writhing naked bodies or present oneself to be flogged; or kiss whomever happened to be nearby. As the night progressed, it would all get more and more frantic. Until, towards dawn, sirens would sound. Everything would have to stop and the world would return to normal. Special buses would take people home; asking someone what they had done that night would be as impolite and taboo as requesting to know the contents of their will. Serene music would be played on the radio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The festival would offer protection against feelings of shame. Our picture of normality would become more realistic and more sane. Our vagabond urges wouldn’t have such disastrous consequences. We would end up kinder to others – and to ourselves – until the next Carnival night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Resentment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We get driven quietly demented by other people. There are things we resent about our parents, partners, children. The stored up agitation and frustration festers. We find indirect, subtle ways of punishing others for the things that upset us. We’re too polite, cautious and worried about hurting others to do much about these things. But relationships get awkward and difficult and bitterness can take hold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1304" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3376599.jpg" alt="Lover's Chat" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resentment Day is designed to help us deal with this kind of situation. On this special day, there would be permission – in fact a requirement – to explain the basis of all of one’s resentments to other people. Half the time, you would be on the receiving end and this would mean having to be patient and entirely without any desire for vengeance. There would be huge investment in the role of listening to the painful things others articulate. The day’s heros would be the listeners. One would not be allowed to shout, or accuse back or get furious or run away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Resentment Day would end with public ceremonies focused on the elemental griefs of the human condition. It would be collectively asserted that: we are all always anxious; are never fully understood; always carry a pang of loneliness; have potential that is never adequately realised; squander our chances and learn only too late what we should have valued when we had the chance. It is a ceremony to contain and reset our individual dissatisfactions with one another. At midnight, the sky over every city would be illuminated with fireworks which spelt out the closing message: why weep over particular sorrows when the whole of life calls for tears?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Revelation Day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On Revelation Day, we would be entitled – actually required – to tell those close to us something that we’d like them to know but which normally we resist saying – because we fear their reaction. It would be a condition that the other person couldn’t get furious or vindictive, whatever it was. They would have to listen patiently. A typical revelation gift would be a fifteen-minute hour glass – because this is how long the other would be required to listen in silence. Then, of course, one would have to hear the revelations of other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2536968847_fcb2788a58_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6870" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2536968847_fcb2788a58_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="2536968847_fcb2788a58_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’d be tears along the way. It would be hard at moments. We’d learn some fascinating and distressing things: about infidelity, addictions, lies, betrayals… And yet many people would find that the day would end with enthusiastic love making. The cultural assumptions around Revelation Day would be that it was not to do with breaking up or with seeking to cause the other pain. Telling others would be a mark of great trust – and acceptance would be utterly heroic. There would be pervasive social pressure to use the opportunity in good faith. Occasionally people would get stigmatised as Revelation Day abusers – a hard reputation to live down. For the most part, the day would be cherished as an occasion to reveal and properly accept each other’s humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is so full of demands, one is so much at risk of being depleted and over-strained, that it’s entirely understandable that we restrict the circle of people with whom we identify.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But on Empathy Day, there would be a deliberate, highly social attempt to change our habits. A central premise of Empathy Day would be that we find it quite hard to see where we are excessively negative and hostile about a particular group of people. Lack of empathy often lurks behind what feel like rational condemnations. So a crucial moment in this would be a diagnostic test – which would usually be done in the morning. All media outlets would be required by law to promote the test. On whom is one tempted to look down? For what groups does one reserve special ire? For some there would be an urgent need to develop empathy with marginal and disadvantaged groups. But for others, this might not be where empathy was currently lacking. They might find that it was deadbeat dads (or rich socialists or Evangelical Christians, or ultra-orthodox Jews or people who like Kim Kardashian or support the Muslim Brotherhood) that they loathed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1307" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/145700381.jpg" alt="Kim Kardashian Hosts Hard Rock Hotel's Hottest Party - Rehab Sundays" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© WireImage</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of empathy would not be that one started to feel particularly sorry for the other group. Or started to admire them. Empathy is about the possibility of identification. When you empathise you don’t necessarily agree at all. But you do see how someone can be human, can be a bit like you, and end up where they are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Empathy generates self-knowledge and a more accurate perception of the world. Empathy is a cure for the blindness that commitment to certain causes risks bringing with it. Someone wanting to change public attitudes to the melting of the polar ice would – on Empathy Day – be helped to recognise from the inside how boring and annoying their concerns could feel to someone else. On Empathy Day, you would be asked to describe (without being snide or ironic) why it would be attractive to support a political movement that currently appalled you or left you cold. Empathy Day would amount to a thrilling day of travel into obscure territory, the minds of those who scare you or leave you indifferent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Stoic Day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On this day, people would collectively try out exposing themselves – in imagination – to the most frightening scenarios. For a day, the whole nation would submit to austerity rations pegged to the living standards of the poorest nation on earth (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Everyone would have to wash their own clothes by hand. Clingy people would try out living alone. There would be exercises in self-reliance. Central heating and air conditioning would be forbidden. The news would be dominated by stories of what goes on in palliative care units and hospices. Prominent figures would make speeches about the brevity of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1309" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/457461829.jpg" alt="Aging Prisoners Make Up Fastest Growing Segment Of Nation's Prison Population" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point would be to accommodate ourselves to the pains and sorrows which may and will come our way. Its aim would be to cultivate a species of courage. What we know always has less power over our imaginations. But the bigger payoff of the day would be a greater appreciation of things we had come to take for granted. For a little while at least after the day, we would be properly grateful for our advantages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would be a sequence of events across the year which would help us keep our troubles, disappointments (and hopes) in proportion. A central event in this festival would be Cloud Day, an annual event which would take place early in the evening on 2nd October. Everyone would take time (usually around fifteen minutes) to contemplate the sky. There would be quite a bit of build up; celebrities would discuss their favourite kinds of clouds and why these mean so much to them and what they are hoping to see this year. The elderly would reminisce about the spectacular 1981 cumulonimbus. Young people would be earnestly instructed on appropriate behaviour and how to cultivate the correct inward attitude. We’d learn to put our troubles up against a broader canvas – and feel their weight and size diminish accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1311" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/146143856.jpg" alt="Sunset with Clouds" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© UIG/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than feel embarrassed about collective events, the Utopian society would recognise that we need help in scheduling certain emotions and attitudes. We might agree with these in theory, but privately, don’t get around to emphasising them sufficiently. The festivals would take care of this for us: they would make sure that we were regularly brought into contact with dispositions that we most need in order to thrive, tolerate one another and face the great challenges of existence.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Generous, thoughtful, sensitive people are often drawn to the view that we shouldn’t expect economies to ‘grow’. After all, the earth and its resources are limited, so why keep asking for GDP to expand? We don’t need more commercial activity or more businesses. We are destroying the planet fast enough as it is.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2583" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/83499093-635x4232.jpg?resize=635%2C4232" alt="The Effects of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2">According to the environmental story, Capitalism pillages the planet for the sake of producing vast quantities of material possessions, many of which we do not really need and only crave because we are duped by relentless advertising.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2584" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76499180.jpg" alt="Workers Assemble Dolls On Production Line" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The implication is that we need to wind back consumerism in order to improve society and lead better lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It’s understandable if this opinion is widespread. But perhaps the good future depends not on minimising Capitalism but on radically extending it.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, Capitalism should address the full range of needs of mankind as efficiently and effectively as possible. This is not currently happening: despite all the factories, the concrete, the highways and the logistics chains, the economy is as yet far too small and desperately undeveloped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations, Capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs, for sanitation, shelter, food supply and health care. The largest and most successful corporations have been those that satisfied appetites that we would categorise as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs: oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, insurance and banking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2585" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_1.png" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">The pyramid of our needs</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The briefest glance at the pyramid reveals a fascinating possibility: that the future growth of business will lie in an assault on a vast array of needs further up the pyramid, in the areas of love and belonging, esteem and self-actualisation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalists and companies are seemingly – semi-consciously – aware of this issue. The evidence lies in advertising. Advertising almost always tries to sell us stuff with an appeal to our higher needs, by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfilment, authenticity, good relationships and a sense of true achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2586" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scarlett-Johansson1.jpg" alt="Scarlett-Johansson" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, as yet, the corporations who pay for the adverts are not actually devoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked. We get promised friendship or love and end up with a 4×4 or a new barbecue set. Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy; it already trades on all the right fantasies. It’s just that there are as yet very few of the truly right products and services out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, only in the last five minutes of our history have we realised that there are very big business opportunities to be found in friendship. And yet Facebook is still making only a rudimentary contribution to the ideal development of this activity. Similarly, only very recently has there been commercial exploration of the fact that we need to keep secrets, yet feel very drawn to raw, dramatic confession as well. A new app which helps us in this area – https://www.secret.ly/ – is now a very successful business enterprise in Silicon Valley, worth tens of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An organised response to our higher needs is not novel. Religions used to address them. Catholicism, if seen as a business, would be the second largest corporation in the world, bigger than Ford or BP or Samsung. Art galleries and museums shared some of the character of religions and similarly tried to address our higher needs, although their clients tended to be governments and nations rather than individual customers.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Bigger than Samsung</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call ‘a business idea’ is at heart just an as yet unexplored need. To trace the future shape of Capitalism, we only have to think of all the needs we have that are, currently, poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no shortage: we need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities. We need help in bringing up children. We need help in calming down at key moments (the cost of our high anxiety and rage is appalling in aggregate). We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace and understanding where we can best deploy them (a service in this area would matter a great deal more to us than pizza delivery). We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires. Elegant town centres, charming high streets and sweet villages are in desperately short supply and are therefore absurdly expensive – just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed but were very rare and only for the very rich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4194" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to do what he did – but in the realm of houses, friendship, anxiety…</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These higher needs are not trivial or minor wants, little things we could easily survive without. They are, in many ways, absolutely central to our lives. We have simply accepted, without really thinking about it, that there is nothing we can do to address them. And yet to be able to structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t know, today, quite what the businesses of the future will look like. Just as in 1975, no one could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google. But we know the direction we need to head to: we need the drive and inventiveness of Capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life. This will offer an exit from the failings and misery that attend Capitalism today. In a nutshell, the problem is that we waste resources on unimportant things. And we are wasteful, ultimately, because we lack self-knowledge, because we are using consumption merely to divert or quieten anxieties or in a vain search for status and belonging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we could just address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained, our work would be more meaningful and our profits would be more honourable. That’s the ideal future of Capitalism.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Patek Philippe is one of the giants of the global watchmaking industry, with revenues last year of just short of 750 million euros. For years now, they have been running a very distinctive series of adverts featuring parents and children. You’re sure to have glimpsed one somewhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4185" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsA1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="PM-200214-advertsA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In one example, there’s a father and son together in a motorboat, a scene which tenderly evokes filial and paternal loyalty and love. The son is listening carefully while his kindly dad is telling him about some aspect of seafaring. We can imagine the boy will grow up confident and independent – yet also respectful and warm. He’ll be keen to follow in his father’s footsteps and emulate his best sides. The father has put a lot of work into the relationship (one senses they’ve been out on the water a number of times, and when the boy was younger, there might have been marathon Lego building sessions in the bedroom) and now the love is being properly paid back. The advertisement understands our deepest hopes. Yet it is moving precisely because what it depicts is so hard to find in real life. Father-son relationships rarely go so well. There is neglect, rebellion and bitterness. Dad was too often away. The son is caught up in a bad group at school. There’s no chance to talk any more. But for a moment, thanks to Patek Philippe, we are afforded a glimpse of psychological paradise; no wonder if we are touched.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsB11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4882" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsB11.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="PM-200214-advertsB1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take this ad from Calvin Klein. The parents and children have tumbled together in a happy heap. There is laughter; everyone can be silly together, there is no more need to put up a front, because everyone here is trusting and on the same side. No one understands you like these people do. In the anonymous airport lounge, in the lonely hotel room, you’ll think back to this cozy group and miss them terribly. Alternatively, you might already miss those years, quite a way back, when it was all so easy. The kids are older now and the stresses are much greater. Only last week, there was a horrific row over drugs and mobile phones. Your relationship with your spouse is suffering too. Calvin Klein knows all this; it too has latched on to our deepest, and at the same time, most elusive inner longings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adverts wouldn’t work as well as they do if they didn’t operate with a very good sense of what our real needs are; what we really require to be happy. Their emotional pull is based on knowing us extremely well. We are creatures who hunger for sexual love, good family relationships, connections with others and the feeling that we are respected. Advertisers understand these needs so very well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, armed with this knowledge, they are unwittingly extremely cruel to us. For while they excite us with reminders of our buried longings, they refuse to do anything sensible or sincere to quench them adequately. They show us paradise, then don’t sell us anything with whose help we might reach it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, adverts do sell us things. Just rather inadequate things in relation to the hopes they arouse. Calvin Klein makes lovely cologne. Patek Philippe’s watches are extremely reliable agents of time-keeping. But it’s hard to see how these products are going to help us secure the goods our unconscious believed were on offer. A watch, or a bottle of scent – however excellent in their own way – don’t have the answers to our psychological needs (which impelled our purchases). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsC1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4885" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200214-advertsC1.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="PM-200214-advertsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re often selling each other the wrong things; material things rather than the more important psychological tools we need.</span> Business needs to get more ambitious, we should turn our energies to creating new kinds of products – as strange sounding today as a wrist watch would have seemed in 1500. We need the drive of commerce and industrialisation to get behind filling the world – and our lives – with products that really can help us to thrive, flourish, find contentment and manage our relationships well. Only this will help us to make real the lovely ideals which the adverts of today make us gaze at from far away.</p>
<p class="p1">At present, adverts often look slightly ridiculous if they are examined carefully. The teams of executive and creatives who came up with this image put a finger on some big concerns. They realise how much we long for companionship, confidence and a feeling of freedom. This ad is designed to enliven our hopes:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ad1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9194" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ad1.jpg?resize=423%2C317" alt="Ad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Yet all that is on offer to help us in our quest for a better life is a phone. It might be great but on its own can do little to help us find the feelings which the image evokes.</p>
<p>It’s common to complain that the advert is attempting to trick us into embracing a falsehood; trying to get us to believe that if only we buy the product we will get the other things too. It’s a recurrent theme in our relationships with advertisements.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google-ad-crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9549" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Google-ad-crop.jpg?resize=651%2C394" alt="Google ad crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In order to sell us its products, Google is tapping into one of our greatest emotional needs: the sense that we have properly explored the world and humanity. However, having evoked this grand need, the answer it proposes is humbly small: this is a call for us to spend a bit more time looking up a restaurant or cinema on Google Maps. That&#8217;s no terrible thing, but it&#8217;s rather a let-down given the emotional button that Google&#8217;s advert had skilfully pressed.</p>
<p>It can seem as if the adverts are trying to deceive us, alluding to emotional needs while in fact only catering to material ones. But, in fact, the problem does not usually lie with the advert, rather with the products on offer. The need for a sense of belonging or a sense of exploration are real, but a phone or map app, however good, probably aren&#8217;t the answer. The worries are much bigger than the products seem to understand.</p>
<p>The real crisis of Capitalism is that product development lags so far behind the best insights of advertising. Advertising has cottoned onto the fact that we would love to get help with the true challenges of life. We want to have better careers, stronger relationships, greater confidence. But products do not focus on those issues at all. The solution will come when producers actually begin to address the ambitious and important matters that adverts have so far merely known how to identify. Instead of asking how can we get people to buy a phone or a watch they have made, businesses should be seeking to create goods and services that really do help people find companionship, from and maintain strong families, be more courageous and cope better with the fear of missing out. These are the things &#8211; as the advertisers already understand &#8211; that we all really want.</p>
<p>In most adverts, the pain and the hope of our lives have been superbly identified, but the product is almost comically at odds with them. Manufacturers are hardly to blame. They are, in fact, the victims of an extraordinary problem of modern capitalism. We long to have strong relationships with our children, we desperately want the generations to feel loyal to one another and get on well. But we have been putting our highest creative efforts into minimising the size of cameras and speeding up the transmission of data. And so we have nothing better to offer ourselves &#8211; in the face of our troubles &#8211; than a slightly larger hand-held screen.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the UK, and some other parts of the developed world, unemployment continues to fall – if only very slightly. It’s good news. It’s something to cheer that productive forces in the economy are growing and that there is a little more money in people’s pockets.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if one gets more ambitious about human potential, a darker picture emerges – darker than that suggested by the figures from government bodies like the UK Office of National Statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2624" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentA.png" alt="PM-210214-unemploymentA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">UK unemployment (ILO) February 2014 © CESI</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should draw a further distinction. Employment means being, generically, in work. But misemployment means being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any real sincerity the true needs of other people: merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead. The way Primark, Patek Philippe and youporn.com might.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4335" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Dressing up as a hotdog to entice customers: misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man employed by the casino chain Las Vegas Sands to hand out flyers to tourists so as to entice them to use slot machines is clearly ‘employed’ in the technical sense. He’s marked as being off the unemployment registers. He is receiving a wage in return for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of the human condition of interest to his employers: that not enough tourists might otherwise leave the blue skies and cheerful bustle of a south Nevada city’s main street to enter the dark air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed casino lined with ranks of ringing consoles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5975684097_da7c929170_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6897" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5975684097_da7c929170_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="5975684097_da7c929170_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Misemployment in the logistics industry</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man is indeed employed, but in truth, he belongs to a large subsection of those in work we might term the ‘misemployed’. His labour is generating capital, but it is making no contribution to human welfare and flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and highly-sugared drinks (however delicious). The rate of misemployment in the economy might be very high.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2627" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentD.jpg" alt="This photo shows 11 June 1999 the exterior of Prix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects and construction workers were misemployed here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while we may be genuinely grateful for a job and give our best to do it well, at the back of our minds we do – as employees – nurture the hope that our work contributes in some real way to the common good; that we are making, modestly, a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just the most dramatically harmful kinds of work that register as misemployment. We intuitively recognise it when we think of work as ‘just a job’; when we sense that far too much of our time, effort and intelligence is spent on meetings that resolve little, on chivying people to sign up for products that – in our heart of hearts we don’t admire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Economists and governments have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy has been the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment has been to ‘stimulate demand.’</span></p>
<p class="p1">Though technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and misemployment.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2628" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentE.jpg" alt="INDIA-BRITAIN-ECONOMY-AUTO-BOLLYWOOD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Headlamp designers, paint engineers and models: all misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there are real solutions to bringing down the rate of misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se, the trick is to stimulate the right demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a nation properly concerned with misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. 20 per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another 30 per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5002" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg?resize=635%2C383" alt="FOX 2013 Summer TCA Tour - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">Not yet gainfully employed</h5>
<p class="p1">To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the value of what is truly valuable and walk past what fails to address their true needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not suggesting the employment figures are irrelevant – they matter a great deal. They are the first thing to be attended to. All the same the raw figures mask a more ambitious index: are we deploying human capital admirably?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It doesn’t from a distance seem as if philosophy and business would have anything to say to one another. Businesses are concerned with meeting strict targets under time pressure, maximising revenue and outwitting competitors. Philosophy is concerned with the largest and most impractical questions about the meaning of life; it sets itself no targets and has no practical outcomes.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2645" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessA.jpg" alt="(From L. to R.) - Iranian businessman Am" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1">Spot the odd one out: businessman listens to French philosophers</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in reality, business and philosophy have a huge amount to offer one another. Beneath their interest in profits, businesses are forced to engage with nothing less than the issue of how to satisfy their customers, a subject full of contradictions and complexities. For its part, philosophy has spent most of its long history investigating the ingredients of a good life, what Aristotle called eudaimonia, a Greek word translated as ‘flourishing’ or ‘fulfilment’. In their different ways, philosophy and business have to work out how to satisfy people – and therefore how they tick.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2646" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessB.jpg" alt="Illustration of Aristotle Teaching a Young Alexander the Great" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The secret to building a great empire: philosophical tutelage</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most businesses outside a tiny crooked minority have to be committed to promoting the flourishing of their customers. Their long-term survival depends on it. Perhaps they’re selling people hand dryers or household insurance, but ultimately, their livelihoods depend on the accuracy with which they have discerned the true needs of those they have set out to serve: profit is the reward for working out the reality of your clients ahead of anyone else. In order to work through the psychology of their clients, businesses commonly rely on market research, carried out for them via focus groups and interviews. But they are typically not stepping back and properly thinking about human nature from a 2,000 year cultural perspective and their analyses of their customers suffer as a result. An ordinary businessman would ask: ‘How do I improve my margins in the ski business?’ But a philosopher would ask: ‘Where is the need to ski rooted in the human soul?’ Eventually the philosopher would find a way back to the balance sheet, but the starting point would be higher and broader and the results often more interesting. With a proper philosophical perspective on the needs of customers, businesses can start to see new market opportunities, rather than merely being left to fiddle with margins, wages and logistics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-010414-businessC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4324" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-010414-businessC.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="Apple Announces iPod Upgrades" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1">Philosophy by other means</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Asked to analyse a business, a philosopher would typically start by asking what the deep purpose of the business was: that is, what its eudaimonic promise to its customers was made up of. Then he or she would look at how well the company was living up to the promise, before delivering suggestions of new products, services or brand messages that would align a company more closely with its implicit promises.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine an ambitious luxurious hotel trying to stay afloat in a competitive market. The hotel would tend to imagine it knew what it needed to do for its customers; the struggle would be all around delivery. However, what tends to be rushed is the definition of what exactly a good night in a hotel actually is. Where do the sheets and the minibar fit into this? What’s the role of the soap and room service? What if one went back to the drawing board about what a hotel is?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-010414-businessD.jpg" alt="PM-010414-businessD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Treehotel/Brittas Pensionat</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A hotel with imagination</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many problems that can destroy a night in a hotel. Here are some of the ones that tend not to get thought about (they’re too philosophical): one might feel anxious or confused. One might be lonely. One might have an argument with one’s spouse. One might feel disconnected from the culture of the country all around. Typically, hotels don’t think these sort of problems belong to them. They limit their focus to the soap and the bed. In other words, they’re forgetting the full range of implicit promises they’ve made to their customers: you will be happy with us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A hotel that took fulfilment very seriously might be led to develop a whole range of new services and products. Hotels, like so many businesses, are only at the dawn of understanding their customers’ real needs, because they operate with an overly narrow definition of happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar issues bedevil financial services. Take wealth management. On the surface, this is a business that promises customers a certain return a year on their portfolios. But the deeper implicit promise is: ‘you will live well with money around us’. However, very few firms have offerings connected up with this grand claim, rendering them intensely vulnerable to competition and downturns in their financial performance. A wealth management firm under philosophical guidance wouldn’t stop looking after money in the standard ways, but it would also be asking how clients can properly flourish around money. How well are the clients’ children relating to money? How has money affected the clients’ friendships? What is the point of philanthropy? What has been the meaning of their lives? As with the example of the hotel, these are questions that implicitly fall under the remit of a particular business, but the business is not looking at them squarely and imaginatively.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Letting the odd philosopher into a business is not an indulgence. It helps management to think more deeply about what a business should properly be trying to do with the customer’s life in order to improve it. There is, fortunately, no enduring conflict between understanding the psyche and making some money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the big convictions of our times is that the fast food industry is to blame for a considerable number of ills of the modern world. This industry is held to be a vital factor in explaining why there are so many low paid jobs, why obesity is on the rise and why so many high streets have lost their character. They’re also to blame for why the content of the burgers themselves is so low grade in comparison with escalopes of wild salmon or breasts of organic chicken.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210314-mcdonaldsA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4191" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210314-mcdonaldsA.jpg?resize=635%2C428" alt="Earns McDonalds" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems natural to point the finger of blame for this, and many other sorry states of affairs, at big corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, in truth, there is an unexpected, and more important, cause of dispiriting jobs, garish signage, environmental abuse and troubling ingredients: our taste. Collectively, it is we, the consumers, who opt for certain kinds of ease and excitement over others. And once that basic fact is in place, everything else follows in the slipstream. It’s not companies that primarily degrade the world. It is our appetites, which they merely serve.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7841881384_6d69f688d8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9730" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7841881384_6d69f688d8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7841881384_6d69f688d8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people who run fast food companies don’t, in their cunning hearts, think that their offerings are ideal, or that the job opportunities they provide are humane. They are not driven by a fixed desire to cook rubbish or create repetitive, stressful low-paid employment. They just want, very badly, to make a profit, but they’d make it anywhere if they could. If we wanted to buy wild salmon or pay a little extra for staff medical insurance, they’d let us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be deeply bothered by poor quality food, exploitative jobs and ugly environments; but in the hugely important task of unleashing a workable social and economic revolution, it matters a great deal where we point the finger of blame. The sobering news is that if all the managers and board members of certain objectionable conglomerates were sacked, similar pathologies of capitalism would spring up again at once.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1">© Ellen Wznick/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t what these businesses are offering, since an offer can always be politely declined; it’s what we are choosing. The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd-sounding, but critical task: the education of the consumer.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t always feel comfortable admitting it to our friends; it is embarrassing. But, secretly, the idea of being famous has great appeal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fame is deeply attractive because it seems to offer very significant benefits. The fantasies go like this: when you are famous, wherever you go, your good reputation will precede you. People will think well of you, because your merits have been impressively explained in advance. You will get warm smiles from admiring strangers. You won’t need to make you own case laboriously on each occasion. When you are famous, you will be safe from rejection. You won’t have to win over every new person. Fame will mean other people will be flattered and delighted even if you are only slightly interested in them. They will be amazed to see you in the flesh. They’ll ask to take a photo with you. They’ll sometimes laugh nervously with excitement. Furthermore, no one will be able to afford to upset you. When you’re not pleased with something, it will become a big problem for others. If you say your hotel room isn’t up to scratch, the management will panic. Your complaints will be taken very seriously. Your happiness will become the focus of everyone’s efforts. You will make or break other people’s reputations. You’ll be boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2735" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kristen1.jpg" alt="Premiere Of Summit Entertainment's &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The desire for fame has its roots in the experience of neglect, in injury. No one would want to be famous who hadn’t also, somewhere in the past, been made to feel extremely insignificant. We sense the need for a great deal of admiring attention when we have been painfully exposed to earlier deprivation. Perhaps one’s parents were hard to impress. They never noticed one much, they were so busy on other things, focusing on other famous people, unable to have or express kind feelings, or just working too hard. There were no bedtime stories and one’s school reports weren’t the subject of praise and admiration. That’s why one dreams that one day the world will pay attention. When we’re famous, our parents will have to admire us too (which throws up an insight into one of the great signs of good parenting: that your child has no desire to be famous).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But even if our parents were warm and full of praise, there might still be a problem. It might be that it was the buffeting and indifference of the wider world (starting with the schoolyard) that was intolerable after all the early years of adulation at home. One might have emerged from familial warmth and been mortally hurt that strangers were not as kind and understanding as one had come to expect. The crushing experience of humiliation might even have been vicarious: one’s mother being rudely dismissed by a waiter; one’s father standing awkwardly alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fame3-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4252" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/fame3-1.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Dreams Of Fame" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is common to all dreams of fame is that being known to strangers emerges as a solution to a hurt. It presents itself as the answer to a deep need to be appreciated, and treated decently by other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet fame cannot accomplish what is asked of it. It does have advantages, which are evident. But it also introduces a new set of very serious disadvantages, which the modern world refuses to view as structural rather than incidental. Every new famous person who disintegrates, breaks down in public or loses their mind is judged in isolation, rather than being interpreted as a victim of an inevitable pattern within the pathology of fame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One wants to be famous out of a desire for kindness. But the world isn’t generally kind to the famous for very long. The reason is basic: the success of any one person involves humiliation for lots of others. The celebrity of a few people will always contrast painfully with the obscurity of the many. Being famous upsets people. For a time, the resentment can be kept under control, but it is never somnolent for very long. When we imagine fame, we forget that it is inextricably connected to being too visible in the eyes of some, to bugging them unduly, to coming to be seen as the plausible cause of their humiliation: a symbol of how the world has treated them unfairly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So soon enough, the world will start to go through the rubbish bags of the famous, it will comment negatively on their appearance, it will pour over their setbacks, it will judge their relationships, it will mock their new movies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fame makes people more, not less, vulnerable, because it throws them open to unlimited judgement. Everyone is wounded by a cruel assessment of their character or merit. But the famous have an added challenge in store. The assessments will come in from legions of people who would never dare to say to their faces what they can now express from the safety of the newspaper office or screen. We know from our own lives that a nasty remark can take a day or two to process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lana2-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4250" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lana2-1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="House Festival" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social media hasn’t helped. It’s made it far easier than before to be famous. And therefore, by necessity, far easier to be hated. A minor celebrity can now regularly face all the vitriol previously accorded only to Hollywood stars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Psychologically, the famous are of course the very last people on earth to be well equipped to deal with what they’re going through. After all, they only became famous because they were wounded, because they had thin-skin; because they were in some respects a bit ill. And now far from compensating them adequately for their disease, fame aggravates it exponentially. Strangers will voice their negative opinions in detail, unable or simply unwilling to imagine that famous people bleed far more quickly than anyone else. They might even think the famous aren’t listening (though one wouldn’t become famous if one didn’t suffer from a compulsion to listen too much).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lindsay.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4246" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/lindsay.jpg?resize=635%2C562" alt="Lindsay Lohan Progress Report Hearing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every worst fear about oneself (that one is stupid, ugly, not worthy of existence) will daily be actively confirmed by strangers. One will be exposed to the fact that people one has never met, about whom one would have only goodwill, actively loathe one. One will learn that detestation of one’s personality is – in some quarters – a badge of honour. Sometimes the attacks will be horribly insightful. At other times, they’ll make no sense to anyone who really knows one. But the criticisms will lodge in people’s minds nevertheless – and no lawyer, court case or magician can ever delete them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Needless to say, as a hurt celebrity, one won’t be eligible for sympathy. The very concept of a hurt celebrity is a joke, about as moving for the average person as the sadness of a tyrant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To sum up: fame really just means you get noticed a great deal – not that you get understood, appreciated or loved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At an individual level, the only mature strategy is to give up on fame. The aim that lay behind the desire for fame remains important. One does still want to be appreciated and understood. But the wise person accepts that celebrity does not actually provide these things. Appreciation and understanding are only available through individuals one knows and cares about, not via groups of a thousand or a million strangers. There is no shortcut to friendship – which is what the famous person is in effect seeking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jla.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4248" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jla.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="Jennifer Lawrence out and about in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, America - 13 Jun 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those who are already famous, the only way to stay sane is to stop listening to what the wider world is saying. This applies to the good things as much as to the bad. It is best not to know. The wise person knows that their products need attention. But they make a clear distinction between the purely practical needs of marketing and advocacy and the intimate desire to be liked and treated with justice and kindness by people they don’t know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a collective, political level we should pay great attention to the fact that, today, so many people (particularly young ones) want to be famous – and even see fame as a necessary condition for a successful life. Rather than dismiss this wish, we should grasp its underlying worrying meaning: they want to be famous because they are not being respected, because citizens have forgotten how to accord one another the degree of civility, appreciation and decency that everyone craves and deserves. The desire for fame is a sign that an ordinary life has ceased to be good enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2742" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cake-1.jpg" alt="'The Only Way Is Essex' TV show production stills, Britain - 16 Mar 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution is not to encourage ever more people to become famous, but to put massive efforts into encouraging a greater level of politeness and consideration for everyone, in families and communities, in workplaces, in politics, in the media, at all income levels, especially modest ones. A healthy society will give up on the understandable but erroneous belief that fame might guarantee the kindness of strangers.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the few ambitions shared by politicians across the political spectrum is that of creating a fully meritocratic society, that is, a society in which all those who make it to the top do so only because of their own talents and abilities (rather than thanks to unfair privilege: upper-class parents, a friendship with the boss etc.). Throughout the Western world, all governments have (in theory!) the common goal of trying to create a hierarchy based on actual ability, replacing posh, chinless halfwits with the meritorious, wherever they may be found and whatever age, colour or gender they might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2768" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Obama.jpg" alt="Belgium EU Obama" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This meritocratic ideal has brought opportunity to millions. Gifted and intelligent individuals who for centuries were held down within an immobile, caste-like hierarchy, are now free to express their talents on a more or less level playing field. We have largely turned the page on a western world that was once filled with rulers who were too sick or stupid govern, lords who couldn’t manage their estates, commanders who didn’t understand the principles of battle, peasants who were brighter than their masters and maids who knew more than their mistresses. No longer is background an impassable obstacle to advancement. An element of justice has finally entered into the distribution of rewards.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2770" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leo.jpg" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - Sep 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Moviestore</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is, inevitably, a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: for if we truly believe that we’ve created (or could even one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it necessarily follows that we have to hold the failures exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable, but also deserved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, succeeding financially (without inheritance or contacts) in an economic meritocracy endows individuals with an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old, who had been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel. But, at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also thankfully been spared. The question of why, if one is in any way good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2771" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/London-1.jpg" alt="Children In Tower Hamlets Are Poorest In The UK According To Latest Research" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There has turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the poor. For a certain constituency, it is clear (and perhaps even scientifically provable) that the poor owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy. With the rise of an economic meritocracy, in certain quarters, the poor have moved from being described as ‘unfortunate’, the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally-minded rich, to being described as ‘failures’, fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust self-made individuals, who are disinclined to feel ashamed about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they have escaped. In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in the fertile corners of meritocratic societies, it has become possible to argue that the social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder and so that conditions are already in place for good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder – attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures or simple compassion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2769" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Thatcher.jpg" alt="Miners' strike" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© PA/PA Wire/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the sociologist Michael Young who first explored the downside of a belief in a supposedly just social system. ‘Today all persons, however humble, know they have had every chance,’ he explained in The Rise of the Meritocracy. ‘If they have been labelled “dunce” repeatedly they cannot any longer pretend…  Are they not bound to recognise that they have an inferior status, not as in the past because they were denied opportunity, but because they are inferior?’ To the injury of poverty, a meritocratic system has added the insult of shame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2772" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cameron-1.jpg" alt="Conservative policy on poverty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a symptom of our greater faith in meritocracy that it’s largely become impossible to explain away our failures as the result of ‘bad luck.’ While it is granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping the course of our careers, the evaluation of people proceeds, in practical terms, as if they could fairly be held responsible for their biographies. It would seem unduly (and even suspiciously) modest to ascribe a victory to ‘good luck’ and, more importantly in this context, pitiable to blame defeat on the opposite. Winners make their own luck, insists the modern mantra: which would, for example, have puzzled the ancient Roman worshippers of the Goddess of Fortune. It is alarming enough to have to depend for our status on contingent elements. It is harder yet to live in a world so imbued with notions of rational control that it has largely dismissed ‘bad luck’ as a credible explanation for defeat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But of course, there never can be a truly meritocratic system, because the ‘merit’ of an individual is far too complex and subtle a thing to be determined by what job you have. Those who have faith in meritocracy are essentially subscribing to an insane, and certainly arrogant assumption that ordinary humans (employers, customers) can handily take over the solemn responsibilities that past ages more wisely left in the hands of a God who, helped along by the angels, was due to weigh the souls of each person on the Day Judgement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2773" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dayjudgement.jpg" alt="Dayjudgement" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Hans Memling, <em>The Last Judgement</em> (1467–1471)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To free ourselves from some of the more punishing side-effects of a meritocratic worldview, it would be wise to cease investing something as haphazardly distributed as jobs and money with moral connotations – and to retain a little of the old-fashioned, modest belief in a distinction between what someone earns and what their souls are like.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The Italian luxury car maker Ferrari has unveiled its newest supercar. Named the Ferrari California, it will cost 153,000 GBP and have a maximum speed of 200mph. It is powered by a mighty 3.8 litre twin turbo-charged V8 engine which produces 560 horse-power – equivalent to nearly six Ford Fiestas – and will accelerate from zero to 62mph in just 3.6 seconds.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to be sarcastic at this point. We know, because we hear it so often, that we live in a crazily materialistic society where people buy luxury goods because they are greedy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariB-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4218" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-240214-ferrariB-1.jpg?resize=635%2C352" alt="PM-240214-ferrariB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">A sign of distress, not greed</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this is far from being true. The motivation is in fact, in general, more emotional and touching. We invest in luxuries because we want people to be nice to us. We live in a world of snobs, where we are treated nicely in so far as we can show quite quickly that we are ‘doing well’, and we are ignored and patronised when we aren’t able to demonstrate rank and power. It isn’t the luxury goods we want, so much as the kindness they are a conduit to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most commonly asked question in a new social encounter is: ‘What do you do?’ And according to how you answer this, people are either incredibly pleased to see you, or abandon you as if you were plague-ridden. The company of the snobbish has the power to sadden and unnerve because we sense how little of who we are deep down – that is, how little of who we are outside of our status – will be able to govern their behaviour towards us. We may be endowed with the wisdom of Solomon and have the resourcefulness and intelligence of Odysseus, but if we are unable to wield socially recognised badges of our qualities, our existence will remain a matter of raw indifference to them.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">People will be nice to babies, whatever their behaviour, even without status symbols</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This conditional attention pains us because our earliest memory of love is of being cared for in a naked, impoverished condition. Babies cannot, by definition, repay their carers with worldly rewards. In so far as they are loved and looked after, it is for who they are: identity understood in its most stripped-down state. They are loved for, or in spite of, their uncontrolled, howling and stubborn characters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be tempting to laugh at those who buy luxury goods. But before ridiculing these types, it would perhaps be fairer to wonder about the wider context in which their ‘showing off’ takes place. Rather than teasing the buyers, we may blame the society in which they live for setting up a situation where the purchase of absurdly overpriced brands feels psychologically necessary and rewarding; where respect has become dependent on a fancy lifestyle. Next time you encounter someone driving a Ferrari, assume not that the driver is greedy, but that he or she is extremely vulnerable to insult and to being ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2782" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-240214-ferrariD.jpg" alt="PM-240214-ferrariD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The existence of the luxury goods industry is testimony to a trauma. It is the result of hundreds of thousands of people who feel pressured by the fear of the coldness of others to add an extraordinary amount to their bare selves in order to signal that they too may lay a claim to love. It is fuelled by people who feel (and they’re not wrong) that their chances of being treated with respect will increase if they take the extra precaution of acquiring a high powered job, a Ferrari, a Chanel bag, a Montcler jacket, an Omega watch and an Oswald Boateng suit.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are always bits of evidence turning up that can be used to reinforce such ideas. MPs get rowdy during Prime Minister’s Questions; some of the them fiddled their expenses a while back; they have been known to be desperate for donations and to court unsavoury backers; they don’t know how to answer when a tenacious interviewer goes for them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2799" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Vince.jpg" alt="Debate at the Institute of Directors, London, Britain - 15 Apr 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© REX/Richard Gardner</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But imagine if something far, far more awkward was in fact going on. What if most politicians are not in fact catastrophic, given how challenging it tends to be to govern a country? What if for the most part, they are quite hard working, occasionally intelligent, mildly narcissistic but quite well-intentioned people who in their own ways care quite a bit about the collective good of the country? This doesn’t mean they hit on perfect policies or are effective. But it does mean they’re not merely a bunch of charlatans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This thought is very hard to swallow. It’s strangely not a nice idea. We rebel against it. It’s oddly more manageable to think they are terrible than to think they might be more or less good enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2800" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Theresa2.jpg" alt="Domestic violence report" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Unbearable perhaps: but she’s working hard, trying her best, doing more or less OK</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why are we so drawn to doing our politicians down? Why do we want or need to believe the worst?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because secretly (and rather peculiarly), we envy them. A lot – like we envy anyone with fame, power and a more or less meaningful existence. We envy their connection to the big moving bits of society (the economy, the school system, the future of the air force etc.), their success in getting elected, their status, their opportunity to shape a nation’s destiny, their cars and special passes and their position as insiders in the key discussions and decisions. Furthermore, it’s in the very nature of democracies that we’re encouraged to think that at some level, these people are our equals and should require our gratitude: ‘that person could be me – and I put them there’. And yet it’s humiliating that they seem to be at the controls, and we’re at the back with the other passengers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being cynical about a nation’s entire political class provides a comforting way of telling ourselves that our lives are in no way incomplete. But that’s not necessarily true.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2802" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Osborne.jpg" alt="George Osborne regional visit to South Wales" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p3">© Matthew Horwood/PA Wire/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Yet what if he had some skills (just a few) you didn’t?</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paradoxically, it’s a sign that things are going well if we are governed by people we can envy a little (and therefore, have to declare can’t govern us at all). We need to be administered by people who have some skills we don’t quite have and who are more or less honest and sane. Yet the price we end up paying for being governed by OK types is a permanent need to believe the country is in the hands of morons.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/statueliberty-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4330" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/statueliberty-1.jpg?resize=635%2C514" alt="U.S. Navy Prepares For Columbus Day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For hundreds of years now, humans have tended to believe that the best sort of government is one which leaves its citizens maximally ‘free’. We’ve come to associate good government directly and uncomplicatedly with the promotion of ‘freedom’: freedom to worship as one pleases, to publish what one wants, to dress as one likes, to love whomever one desires. In the meantime, those who have opposed ‘freedom’ have been presented in horrifying terms: they have been the wicked priests, the murderous Communists and the demented Nazis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, this dichotomy (freedom = good/restriction = bad) has blinded us to a vital nuance with a grave potential to derail and corrupt public life: we’ve overlooked that there are better and worse kinds of freedom and that promoting freedom above all other values may be deeply unhelpful to the long-term and collective interests of the nation. Freedom is not a baseless word, but it is in general simply too vague, ambiguous and emotive a term to guide policy or to be an ideal around which a nation can reasonably cohere. It has grown too easy for corrupt and venal organisations to operate under the banner of ‘freedom’ in order to get away with activities that covertly run sharply counter to the public good. Freedom is evidently not a virtue when it involves the freedom of bankers to offload ruinous financial instruments on an uneducated public, just as censorship – that bogeyman of contemporary politics – is evidently far from a vice when it prevents corporations from pushing alcohol on children or denying affordable housing to the poor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9921386226_c32cef9f59_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7836" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/9921386226_c32cef9f59_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9921386226_c32cef9f59_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the word ‘freedom’ would therefore be used with far greater care than today – and would never come at the top of the list of what any government should aim for. The real aim of government should be the promotion of the public good and the flourishing of the greatest number – never simply the defence of the freedom of more or less anyone to do more or less anything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the government would – with great intelligence and democratic accountability – often be interested in restricting freedom. Though we bridle at folk memories of police states, there is a more important and ambitious view of what government is for than merely freedom. Government is the institutionalisation of our long-term and collective interests. And the painful fact is that the pursuit of what matters to us in the long-term and collectively may at times be in sharp conflict with our short term and individual pleasures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3664751409_35774dc9ac_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6881" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3664751409_35774dc9ac_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3664751409_35774dc9ac_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s something parents understand very well about their children. They are forever having to say no – not because they are mean but because they know it’s their job to stand up for their child’s and their society’s longer-term needs. It’s because the parent keeps in mind (when the child can’t) that they will feel sick later, that they’ll be exhausted tomorrow, that they can’t simply cause chaos in the playground, that they step in. We have fully accepted this sort of case at the level of families. But we resist the thought that, as adults in society, we stand in equal need of having our own well-being protected against the worst wishes of others as well as against our own more unhelpful and destructive desires.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian society, there would be two areas in which government would be particularly vigilant. The first would be around freedom of production: defined as the freedom of anyone to use the earth’s resources (including its people) in any way for the generation of any degree of personal gain. Utopian government would in measured and skilful ways constantly step in to say ‘no’ to certain vested interests, without this in any way meaning that it was systematically anti-capitalist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8759446618_1a25ce283a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7834" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8759446618_1a25ce283a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="8759446618_1a25ce283a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/NASA</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One constraint which government would impose would be around what prices things could be sold at. Instead of being in favour of ever falling prices for consumer goods, government would promote the notion of a just price, a floor for prices reflecting the cost of humane and decent employment and production. Paternalistic utopian authorities would factor in what it costs to rear chickens properly and the need for farmers to make a reasonable profit – and it would then set a fair price for a dozen eggs. The Utopian government would stand against the idea that we must necessarily always seek to reduce prices. Instead its ambition would be to get us into the habit of paying the just price: a price that would allow high quality goods attuned to genuine needs to be put together by workers employed at an adequate wage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The government would also take an interest in censorship. The word terrifies us. In the history of censorship, it has generally seemed as if it is invariably something of real value – profound, earnest and true – that is being condemned and banned by someone who is corrupt and ideologically absurd. But in a wiser, more mature society, it would be accepted that the real threat is not always or necessarily that great truths are in danger of being repressed by malign authorities but rather that, sometimes, we are threatened by aggressive and uncontrolled commercial interests determined to quash our peace of mind and confuse us about our real needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1503" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2614890a.jpg" alt="Hayes Primary School, Croydon, United Kingdom. Architect: Hayhurst and Co., 2012." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Utopian government would be guided by a classical view of life in which citizens would be seen as needing help in learning how to live well. This would entail a responsibility not only over schools but also over media and the public realm more generally. Institutions such as a national broadcaster would be given a clear sense of purpose: their task would be the promotion of virtue. The move would be driven not by a merely mean-spirited desire to stop people doing what they wanted; it would be undertaken as a collective and voluntarily-induced act of self-parenting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When translated into politics, paternalism does not have to mean just bossiness and intolerance; it should properly mean that the state will have something in common with what is generally our best (and kindest) experience of having had someone look after our needs: having been someone’s child. The worry in the distant past was that what was most important to us would be undermined because we lacked basic liberties. But, on the whole, this is no longer where the problems of modern existence lie. We have won the battle for liberty. Now the enemies of our collective flourishing are more likely to lie in the troubles of unrestrained corporate and individual appetites and the unlimited pressure to generate immediate profit without regard for human and earthly costs. The government of the future would accept that it was not ultimately responsible just for freedom, but that its highest calling was to act as the guardian of long-term collective flourishing.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The system we know as Capitalism is both wondrously productive and hugely problematic. On the downside, capitalism promotes excessive inequality; it valorises immediate returns over long-term benefits; it addicts us to unnecessary products and it encourages excessive consumption of the world’s resources with potentially disastrous consequences – and that’s just a start. We are now deeply familiar with what can go wrong with Capitalism. But that is no reason to stop dreaming about some of the ways in which Capitalism could one day operate in a Utopian future:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we’d spend less time thinking about the Dow Jones.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Dow Jones, which is the world’s most prestigious financial index, takes a daily temperature reading of the US, assigning it a very precise number, which is widely reported in the news and which we tend to treat with a high degree of reverence. Such financial data seems to be telling us something of immense importance. It hints at an answer to the great questions of existence: are things going well or badly, is the world doing OK? How is life on earth?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7821" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="14313202637_0cc6ec8649_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Scott Beale</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really worth asking such questions and reflecting heavily upon them. This is what philosophers traditionally like to do. But the numbers do not actually answer our questions, for the links between the Dow Jones figures and what is actually going on in human lives (their rise or fall) is far more elusive. It’s not that there is no connection whatsoever. The financial health of major US companies does have indirect, distant links to the economic side of everyone’s life. Yet the quality and character of daily life is powerfully affected by a great many things which the financial data does not recognise, for example, your health, the view from your window, the quality of your relationship, the amount of time you have to spend commuting, the connections you have with the neighbours, the state of your ambitions, your degree of envy, how your kids are doing. These may, indeed, be rather more important in determining ‘how things are going’ than the Dow Index. But the Dow doesn’t entirely admit this. It seems to be making a larger claim: to know how your life is going – and it brings to this claim a panoply of impressive arrows, charts and incomprehensible acronyms which cow us into believing in its authority, rather as our ancestors might have trusted in the confused mumblings of a priest sitting on top of an altar in a darkened temple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dow_Jones_Ticker.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4333" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Dow_Jones_Ticker.jpeg?resize=635%2C531" alt="Dow_Jones_Ticker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all our expertise, we have not yet learned how to devise reliable indicators of the state of nations and individuals. We do not have a daily set of figures to record what truly matters. It might help, for example, to know the incidence of unnecessary embarrassment or whether arrogance is becoming 0.1% more or less common. We don’t have figures measuring supplies of patience, tact and forbearance. We don’t have indices around envy, infidelity and fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of these vital indicators, we cling to the signals offered to us by Wall Street. We use words like depression and exuberance, terms well known from personal life, to describe the movements of stocks and shares. To ask for better indices of national well being sounds whimsical. Yet it ought not to, for we need data that homes in on things that matter greatly for what our lives are actually like. Issues like jealousy, boredom, beauty, frustration or anger shape our destinies just as much – if not more – than the fortunes of 3M (the Minnesota Mining Company) and the twenty nine other corporations whose trading forms the basis for calculating the Dow Jones figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big issue is how we can get a diversity of indicators on our national dashboards. We are not suggesting the suppression of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. What we want to see is the rise of other – equally important – figures that report on a regular basis on elements of psychological and sociological life and which could form part of the consciousness of thoughtful and serious people. Today, a government cannot get rewarded, or chastised, for the impact its policies have on the frequency of domestic rows because rows are not recorded. When we measure things – and give the figures a regular public airing – we start the long process of collectively doing something about them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t just care about unemployment, we’d also worry about misemployment.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Employment means being, generically, in work. But misemployment means being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any real sincerity the true needs of other people: merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead. Like this fellow, dressing up as a hotdog to entice customers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man employed by the casino chain Las Vegas Sands to hand out flyers to tourists so as to entice them to use slot machines is clearly ‘employed’ in the technical sense. He’s marked as being off the unemployment registers. He is receiving a wage in return for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of the human condition of interest to his employers: that not enough tourists might otherwise leave the blue skies and cheerful bustle of a south Nevada city’s main street to enter the dark air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed casino lined with ranks of ringing consoles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man is indeed employed, but in truth, he belongs to a large subsection of those in work we might term the ‘misemployed’. His labour is generating capital, but it is making no contribution to human welfare and flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and highly-sugared drinks (however delicious). The rate of misemployment in the economy is very high.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while we may be genuinely grateful for a job and give our best to do it well, at the back of our minds we do – as employees – nurture the hope that our work contributes in some real way to the common good; that we are making, modestly, a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just the most dramatically harmful kinds of work that register as misemployment. We intuitively recognise it when we think of work as ‘just a job’; when we sense that far too much of our time, effort and intelligence is spent on meetings that resolve little, on chivying people to sign up for products that – in our heart of hearts we don’t admire.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Economists and governments have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy has been the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment has been to ‘stimulate demand.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and misemployment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there are real solutions to bringing down the rate of misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se, the trick is to stimulate the right demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a nation properly concerned with misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. 20 per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another 30 per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul. People would be taught to respect good furniture, healthy food, wholesome clothes, fruitful holidays…</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7819" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="11228552895_1d9ca49c57_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the value of what is truly valuable and walk past what fails to address their true needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t to suggest that the employment figures are irrelevant – they matter a great deal. They are the first thing to be attended to. All the same the raw figures mask a more ambitious index – and a central question: are we deploying human capital admirably?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t just blame big evil corporations for everything.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems natural to point the finger of blame at many bad states of affairs at big corporations. But, in truth, there is an unexpected, and more important, cause of dispiriting jobs, garish signage, environmental abuse and troubling fast-food ingredients: our taste. Collectively, it is we, the consumers, who opt for certain kinds of ease and excitement over others. And once that basic fact is in place, everything else follows in the slipstream. It’s not companies that primarily degrade the world. It is our appetites, which they merely serve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1536" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/106449364.jpg" alt="A photo of a partially eaten McDonalds'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people who run fast food companies don’t, in their cunning hearts, think that their offerings are ideal, or that the job opportunities they provide are humane. They are not driven by a fixed desire to cook rubbish or create repetitive, stressful low-paid employment. They just want, very badly, to make a profit, but they’d make it anywhere if they could. If we wanted to buy wild salmon or pay a little extra for staff medical insurance, they’d let us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be deeply bothered by poor quality food, exploitative jobs and ugly environments; but in the hugely important task of unleashing a workable social and economic revolution, it matters a great deal where we point the finger of blame. The sobering news is that if all the managers and board members of certain objectionable conglomerates were sacked, similar pathologies of capitalism would spring up again at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t what these businesses are offering, since an offer can always be politely declined; it’s what we are choosing. The reform of capitalism hinges on an odd-sounding, but critical task: the education of the consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we’d work for companies we’d be proud to live and die for.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of living and dying for the sake of your work in a hospital or with the army seems utterly credible. The idea of living and dying for your accountancy firm or tanning salon sounds absurd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we don’t typically think of corporations as claiming or deserving any kind of special place in our deep selves. We tolerate the companies who provide the fabric of our incomes by selling phones and shoes, flights, groceries, insurance, trousers, electricity. One might be a bit better than another, offer attractive deals or provide decent service. But this is miles away from deep admiration or love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1538" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/170056241.jpg" alt="Views From The Google Shareholders Meeting As The Company's YouTube Triples Mobile Ad Sales" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to think that that’s exactly how things should be. It’s normal to think that if you’re keeping your wits about you, you should be a touch cynical about – and detached from – the corporate world. Companies sometimes like to talk in terms of love and big missions; but they never quite convince us when they do. It’s easy to satirise their efforts. The slogans are neat (‘We try harder’, ‘Just do it’, ‘I’m lovin’ it…’), but we’re all world-weary enough to shrug our shoulders and walk past with wry disregard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So right now, most corporations don’t deserve our deep admiration – and they don’t get it either. But at various times, we can catch glimpses of how it could be very different. In 1895, it wouldn’t have been at all strange for a station master to get married in his Great Western Railway uniform. Not because he was slavish. But because the ideals of the transport company – with its elegant locomotives, its impeccable service across miles of countryside, its commitment to ethical behaviour and responsible capitalism – resonated so deeply with his own better nature. The company’s devotion to service and reliability, the grandeur of its big stations, the sense of dignity in its pension schemes – these were things someone could take to heart and feel justifiably proud to be part of.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1539" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg" alt="PM-210214-coffinC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would it take for corporations to be worth a wedding suit or indeed our lives? They’d have to engage our better selves, do proper good in the world and help us to become who we want to be. Given how much of our lives we give to our work, these sound like highly necessary and not unrealistic ambitions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>In the Utopia, we wouldn’t loathe the rich or try to tax them more; we’d give them honour and status.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do the rich keep on working? Why do they enter stressful negotiations, constantly take on large risks, battle ambitious, hard-hearted rivals, and scheme and plot until the day they collapse? What are they doing it for? Why aren’t they satisfied with the extensive assets and large piles of money they already have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1540" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/billgates.jpg" alt="GHANA-US-AID-HEALTH-PEOPLE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surveying the problems of Capitalism, the standard response of the left has been to suggest that one simply tax the rich more. But this fails to grasp, and therefore properly to exploit, the real psychological motives of the rich. The rich only pursue money fanatically (to our great collective cost) because wealth appears to be the primary, most objective source of honour in the modern world. If only we can fix how honour is obtained, we will be able to redirect their mania to more socially beneficial ends in ways that don’t demand that the rich become ‘nice’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, a natural inclination is to force the rich to give up their wealth using the instrument of new taxes, but this strategy simply won’t work. The chances of people running away and taking their assets with them is too great. We know that entrepreneurial energy and competitive drive can too easily be depleted; the economic balloon can deflate and all will suffer. We need to go down a different route. We need to harness the talents and drives that the rich are currently using to squeeze the earth and its people too hard – and ensure that these energies are made to address  the collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim should be to seduce the rich – to make them want to benefit their societies in return for giving them what (we know) they deep down really want but haven’t until now reliably been able to get except through money: namely, honour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1541" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-19331466.jpg" alt="Obama Medal of Honor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough that societies can motivate people very powerfully through honour: soldiers will perform extraordinary feats on the battlefield in return for the highest gratitude from their countries (they don’t even ask to be paid very much – paid to die…). Scientists will labour in poverty for decades in the hope of winning a Nobel Prize. Yet as societies, we are only just beginning to explore what good can come out of vanity in the realm of business. In the commercial world, there are at present no systematic, fail-safe methods for gaining status in return for doing what society desperately needs capitalists to do: treat their workers well and produce useful, safe, environmentally-sound goods and services. In some countries, there may be the odd hope of a medal from the president or the queen if one behaves well, but the chances of securing one are simply too remote and unpredictable to motivate hard-headed capitalists in their actions from day to day: it remains far more rational to peg one’s hopes for status on the verifiable criterion of money than on the vague chance of an invitation from the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is precisely what needs to be changed – and urgently. Society should do a systematic deal with capitalists: it should give them the honour and love they so badly crave in exchange for treating their workers as human beings, not abusing customers and properly looking after the planet. A standard test should be drawn up to measure the societal good generated by companies (many such schemes already exist in nascent form), on the basis of which capitalists should then be given extraordinarily prestigious titles by their nations in ceremonies with the grandeur and thrill of film premieres or sporting finales. It might be something to go after their names (for example, RC: Responsible Capitalist), a title that would have some of the same associations as the Nobel Prize, the Victoria Cross and the Pulitzer prize – in other words, a fitting target for the most ambitious and narcissistically craven and damaged people in society to strive for.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The founding figure of modern economics, Adam Smith, adroitly recognised the two chief motivating factors in human life: the love of riches and the love of glory. He knew that these two things are what people ultimately want and what they work hardest for.  A wise society must therefore learn how to harness the love of glory at times, like now, when the public good comes into conflict with the love of riches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1543" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/83499093-635x423.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="The Effects of the Bruce Mansfield Power Plant" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>

<p class="p1"><i>In the Utopia, businesses wouldn’t just satisfy our bodies, they’d take care of our souls.</i></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Generous, thoughtful, sensitive people are often drawn to the view that we shouldn’t expect economies to ‘grow’. After all, the earth and its resources are limited, so why keep asking for GDP to expand? We don’t need more commercial activity or more businesses. We are destroying the planet fast enough as it is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">According to the environmental story, Capitalism pillages the planet for the sake of producing vast quantities of material possessions, many of which we do not really need and only crave because we are duped by relentless advertising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The implication is that we need to wind back consumerism in order to improve society and lead better lives. It’s understandable if this opinion is widespread. But perhaps the good future depends not on minimising Capitalism but on radically extending it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1546" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Scarlett-Johansson.jpg" alt="Scarlett-Johansson" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, Capitalism should address the full range of needs of mankind as efficiently and effectively as possible. This is not currently happening: despite all the factories, the concrete, the highways and the logistics chains, the economy is as yet far too small and desperately undeveloped.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over the last two centuries, in the wealthy nations, Capitalism has evolved to meet many basic material needs, for sanitation, shelter, food supply and health care. The largest and most successful corporations have been those that satisfied appetites that we would categorise as belonging at the bottom of Abraham Maslow’s famous pyramid of needs: oil and gas, mining, construction, retail, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunications, insurance and banking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1547" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" />The briefest glance at the pyramid reveals a fascinating possibility: that the future growth of business will lie in an assault on a vast array of needs further up the pyramid, in the areas of love and belonging, esteem and self-actualisation. Capitalists and companies are seemingly – semi-consciously – aware of this issue. The evidence lies in advertising. Advertising almost always tries to sell us stuff with an appeal to our higher needs, by tugging obliquely at our longings for emotional fulfilment, authenticity, good relationships and a sense of true achievement.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, as yet, the corporations who pay for the adverts are not actually devoted to meeting the needs that their marketing people have so skilfully evoked. We get promised friendship or love and end up with a 4×4 or a new barbecue set. Advertising is always hinting at the future shape of the economy; it already trades on all the right fantasies. It’s just that there are as yet very few of the truly right products and services out there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, only in the last five minutes of our history have we realised that there are very big business opportunities to be found in friendship. And yet Facebook is still making only a rudimentary contribution to the ideal development of this activity. Similarly, only very recently has there been commercial exploration of the fact that we need to keep secrets, yet feel very drawn to raw, dramatic confession as well. A new app which helps us in this area – <a href="https://www.secret.ly"><span class="s2">https://www.secret.ly</span></a>/ – is now a very successful business enterprise in Silicon Valley, worth tens of millions of dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An organised response to our higher needs is not novel. Religions used to address them. Catholicism, if seen as a business, would be the second largest corporation in the world, bigger than Ford or BP or Samsung. Art galleries and museums shared some of the character of religions and similarly tried to address our higher needs, although their clients tended to be governments and nations rather than individual customers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1548" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-18605229-1-1.jpg" alt="Vatican Pope Epiphany" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call ‘a business idea’ is at heart just an as yet unexplored need. To trace the future shape of Capitalism, we only have to think of all the needs we have that are, currently, poorly understood and neglected by the commercial world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no shortage: we need help in forming cohesive, interesting communities. We need help in bringing up children. We need help in calming down at key moments (the cost of our high anxiety and rage is appalling in aggregate). We require immense assistance in discovering our real talents in the workplace and understanding where we can best deploy them (a service in this area would matter a great deal more to us than pizza delivery). We have unfulfilled aesthetic desires. Elegant town centres, charming high streets and sweet villages are in desperately short supply and are therefore absurdly expensive – just as, prior to Henry Ford, cars existed but were very rare and only for the very rich.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1549" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1925.ford_.model_.t.arp_.750pix.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These higher needs are not trivial or minor wants, little things we could easily survive without. They are, in many ways, absolutely central to our lives. We have simply accepted, without really thinking about it, that there is nothing we can do to address them. And yet to be able to structure businesses around these needs would be the commercial equivalent of the discovery of steam power or the invention of the electric light bulb.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t know, today, quite what the businesses of the future will look like. Just as in 1975, no one could describe the current corporate essence of Facebook or Google. But we know the direction we need to head to: we need the drive and inventiveness of Capitalism to tackle the higher, deeper problems of life. This will offer an exit from the failings and misery that attend Capitalism today. In a nutshell, the problem is that we waste resources on unimportant things. And we are wasteful, ultimately, because we lack self-knowledge, because we are using consumption merely to divert or quieten anxieties or in a vain search for status and belonging.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we could just address our deeper needs more directly, our materialism would be refined and restrained, our work would be more meaningful and our profits would be more honourable. That’s the ideal future of Capitalism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Conclusion</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the moment we tend to think that the definitive goal of business is to turn a profit. We assess the success of companies really only in financial terms: the more profitable they are, the better the business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, businesses would of course have to be profitable. But the success of a business would primarily be assessed in terms of its contribution to the collective good. The aim would not be to maximise profits, but to maximise the amount of good that could be done, while still being profitable. In the Utopia it would be understood that the proper end of business is the good.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Calling an idea ‘utopian’ is normally a way of saying it’s pie-in-the-sky and not worth paying attention to. Far from it. Throughout the ages, a number of philosophers have put forward some highly provocative and interesting utopias, describing ideal arrangements of everything from schools to religion, government to holidays.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian ideas aren’t meant to be immediately practical. That’s precisely why they are so useful: they take our minds off the problems of the here and now and offer us a grander vision of what there is to aim for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is the most powerful and prestigious force in contemporary society, replacing religion as the touchstone of authority and meaning. It is usually the first thing we check in the morning and the last thing we consult at night. What are we searching for? The news does its best to persuade us we must keep up with its agenda – but to what end? What are the ghastly, wondrous, thrilling, destructive, bitter stories for?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It would be most honest to admit that we don’t yet know: we’re still working it out collectively. We’re still among the first generations ever to have had access to news on the current scale and we’re struggling to make sense of the deluge of information.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1477" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/151981731.jpg" alt="UKRAINE-PRESS-FEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One thing is for sure: we don’t yet have the news we deserve. The news of our times is predominantly an agent of confusion, envy, purposeless excitement and needless terror.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a wiser, more mature society we’d still engage with the news on a daily basis. But we’d have clearer and more ambitious ideas about what we needed it for.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News would not simply have the job of keeping us up to speed about anything unusual (or horrific) that happened since the last bulletin. It wouldn’t occasionally claim it was trying to keep the powerful in check (however important this aim). Instead the grand purpose of news would be stated clearly: to help the individual and the nation to flourish – and to bring whatever information to the fore that helped with these twin goals.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To carry out this epochal task, the ideal news organisation would bring us some of the following:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Celebrity news</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Serious news organisations are currently highly dismissive of celebrities, and abandon the whole field of celebrity to the lowest outlets, who bring us the celebrities we currently have and know too much about.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But human beings need and will always look for role models. We therefore shouldn’t complain about, or eradicate, ‘celebrity culture.’ We just need to improve it. We need to bring a better kind of person to the fore of public consciousness: we need better celebrities rather than no celebrities at all. Rather than try to suppress our love of celebrity, the news ought to channel it in optimally intelligent and fruitful directions. In the Utopian society, the best-known people (the ones whose parties and holiday photos and clothes and new hairstyles we looked at most often) would also be those who embodied and reinforced the highest, noblest and most socially beneficial values.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1478" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90547441.jpg" alt="Baroness Susan Greenfield, Professor of Pharmacology at Oxford University, at British Council, New Delhi." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News outlets would be engaged in identifying and then promoting a raft of original celebrities, whose virtues captured the best sides of human nature. They would pick out for us the clever and kind research scientists, molecular biologists, poets, venture capitalists, mothers, nurses, cleaners and parking attendants, the very many people who would be more appropriate targets of celebrity than those we know today – people whose physiques, attitudes and routines we should constantly have paraded before us through enticing photography and heart-warming anecdotes. A society can only ever be as good as the celebrities it holds before itself. Serious news in the future would know that no functioning society can do without role models.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Disaster News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news is currently full of senseless horrors: car crashes, drowned toddlers, fatal lightning strikes and so on. Our senses are numbed by the catastrophes. We don’t know where to place them in our minds. We may be tempted to switch off, unable to process the horror.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1479" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/179561968.jpg" alt="Emergency Services Attend Major Road Accident In Kent" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a key task of the news – in a more mature and wise society – would be to use current events to keep returning to one critical theme: the fragility of life. The incidents of the news that get lumped under the term ‘accidents’ demonstrate repeatedly that the routines, habits, hopes and ordinary bother of life can be severed at any point by an utterly unpredictable – but hideously real – freak event. We need to be drawn back time and again to this profound fact. Stories of car crashes or of trees falling on people walking in parks would, in an ideal news service, still be given plenty of attention. For they have the power not only to stir our fears, but to strengthen our resolve, to appreciate more fully, and use more wisely, the present moment; to reform our priorities and to prompt us to kindness and seriousness today, in case tomorrow never comes.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Foreign News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">At the moment, as far as the news is concerned, countries tend to disappear into their worst moments. There are large parts of the world to which we only pay collective attention when something there goes badly wrong. In theory, we know that ordinary things continue in places associated with terror, hatred and intractable conflict. The cities of Syria or Iraq become suicide bombers and tanks; virulent extremists and wailing mothers. And so we stop caring, which has serious policy implications. Widespread indifference makes diplomatic disengagement inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1480" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/127502977.jpg" alt="A Palestinian woman with her baby walk p" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The route to caring about the extraordinary – which is how whatever is foreign at first appears – is through the ordinary. We need to feel close to the ordinary moments of others’ lives before we can care about what happens to them in their tragedies. This is a brute fact about the mechanics of sympathy which the media has forgotten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The ideal news organisation of the future, would therefore tell us about street parties in Addis Ababa, love in Peru, in-laws in Mongolia and rally-driving in Nablus. By humanising the other audiences would be prepared to care just a little more about the next devastating typhoon, violent coup and appalling cluster bomb.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1481" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/469427727.jpg" alt="PERU-THEME-LOVE-VALENTINE'S DAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In order to do this the news organisations of the Utopia would need to summon (that is, source, employ and pay for) artists. For they would realise that the task of making the mundane seductive and making the ordinary lives of others reveal their depth and tenderness does not sit neatly with the traditional journalistic ambition of just telling the facts. The critical task of the journalism of the future would be to get people to care about the facts, not just lay them before the world in their brute outlines (as is done today).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Economic News</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopian news outlet, economic news would be considered hugely important. It would help us understand why our world is the way it is. It would not be focused so much on what is happening day by day (the stock market is moving erratically, exchange rates are volatile) but on the fact that our lives are governed by money in ways we do not adequately control.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1482" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/104511048.jpg" alt="Income Gap Between Rich And Poor Grows To Record Level" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lying awake at night, for instance, some of us may wonder, in a sincere and yet inarticulate way, why it is that the world built by the immense energy and productive power of capitalism is not more humane and attractive. Why is there still so much suffering all around? Why do some have so much and others so little? Why are most jobs mindless? Why can’t there be more security and leisure? Why do anxiety and fear persist almost everywhere? Aren’t we destroying the planet for no particular reason or reward? (By this time it may be getting very late, and only a stubborn few will continue to press on..) Couldn’t we start again in some new way, rejig things, perhaps pass some laws and experiment with bold new ideas in order to create a freer, less anxious, happier world?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Currently, economic news doesn’t equip the population with the tools to understand their servitude. Less than 1% of the members of an advanced economy are in any position to grasp the economic system within which they live. There is widespread and deep ignorance about who owns what, how big money is made, what the relationship between capital, investment and rent is – and how the current system is legally underpinned. People are therefore left to feel a mixture of outrage and impotence. The news of the future would see it as one of its leading tasks to equip the population with the tools to make a better world economically, the world that currently only exists in about 5 highly favoured countries (Denmark, Switzerland, Norway…).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Politics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the aim of political news would be to help the nation to become a better version of itself. The news would ask: how can we get things to go better. The news wouldn’t just look to bring down the odd rotten politician or business person, it would concentrate on systemic problems holding the nation back: it would look to reduce financial anxiety and working hours. It would try to halt environmental degradation. It would investigate why people have to work so hard for so little. It would never lose sight of a truly radical agenda to make the nation as good as it can be.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><i>In its tone, Utopian news would be kindly and generous.</i></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Nastiness is currently deeply prestigious in the world of news. An interviewer who makes a politician look stupid and mean is on track to become a hero.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It started off with politicians. Now it’s spread to almost any target conceivable. We get a secret pleasure when new films are eviscerated by a reviewer. There’s a warm reception for scathing denunciations of sports stars. There’s a ready audience for anything that paints the Prime Minister or President as a shallow fool; we approve when the people running banks are dismissed as venal idiots, or celebrities as pampered, ageing and cheating airheads. Journalists around the world have made careers for themselves being nasty about everyone who comes under their remit. Entire sections of news outlets (<i>Private Eye</i>, <i>New York Observer</i> and <i>Gawker</i>) are given over to vicious, throwaway assessments of other humans.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">When we have a good time with ‘mean news’, we don’t think we are being pointlessly cruel. We just feel that we don’t have much power in the world, that there are lots of things wrong out there and that nastiness is the best, sharpest way to respond to sickness and evil. We’re being harsh, yes, – we think – but we’re calling time on illusion and nonsense. If we get furious and put the boot in, the world has a chance of becoming the better, kinder, saner place we’d like to see.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But the prestige of nastiness rests on some deeply confused assumptions – which run counter to the best ideals of journalism. Yes, it is the task of journalism to be sceptical, to probe beneath the official story and to ask awkward questions in order to uncover the truth. But meanness has nothing to do with this sort of patient forensic scepticism towards complex situations. Meanness has already made up its mind, it knows the story before it even begins to assemble it: it is convinced (through prejudgement) that something or someone is awful, it has shut its ears to any other information, and just wants to kick the boot in with brio.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It sounds mad to argue that we should be nicer to the likes of Marie Le Pen or Murdoch. That’s because we’ve unfortunately confused being nice with a couple of things we rightly fear: being naive and being weak. Listening carefully to what someone says, trying to see the world through their eyes, this has nothing at all to do with agreement. If you start with a determined intent to humiliate someone, their opponents are delighted (because it confirms their prejudices) and yet you arrive at no insight into how to win the hearts and minds of the very many people who really do like what Murdoch or Le Pen have to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should think of being nice as an expression of confident strength; it’s a show of being secure enough to examine points of view that feel foreign to your own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need the news to be nice, not in the sense of reporting only on cuddly, sweet things. But in the sense of operating with a tone that is generous, curious and civil. Awful things won’t go away because we mock them. But if we understand them, see where they are coming from, and treat their advocates and supporters as fellow human beings, we have much more chance of dealing with them successfully – and therefore of making the world a better place.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News from a while back</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What is news? A standard definition might go: ‘news’ is something that people don’t know about, that matters a lot – and that has happened just now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But consider another, subtly different way of defining the subject: ‘news’ is anything that people don’t know about, that matters a lot and that could have happened at any point in time, perhaps today, but equally, perhaps, some time in the fourth century B.C.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The news holds a prestigious place in society because – as it likes to tell us in often bombastic tones – it can inform us about the most important things that have happened anywhere in the world in the past few hours. By its very nature, the news assumes that everyone has by now already heard all about what happened yesterday and the day before – and that everyone has by now already had all the interesting thoughts that it’s ever possible to have about the past, and that we hence never need to go over any of it again. The ‘news’ simply has to be about what happened since the last bulletin – or tweet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1487" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/91792289.jpg" alt="A London Evening Standard employee distr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of the time, this makes great sense. We don’t need to pour over the old stuff. We’re heading into the future, and at dizzying speed, and therefore we need the most up-to-date information, right now. But, sometimes, this philosophy robs us of a chance to get at key bits of information that didn’t gestate since breakfast time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sometimes – and this is something the news will never tell us – the real ‘news’ happened a long time ago. It deserves to be called news because it’s still important, it’s still relevant and most crucially, it’s still new to most people alive now. There’s a lot of vital information out there that for various reasons hasn’t reached us yet. News organisations may boast about their high-tech satellites and fibre-optic cables, but the obstacles to delayed news are often cultural and psychological. Important information floats in the darker parts of the ether, but we’re distracted by other things, no one is bringing it up, we’re looking elsewhere. But the day we learn to tune in at last, it become news.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1488" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-The_Death_of_Socrates_cropped.jpg" alt="640px-The_Death_of_Socrates_cropped" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the early 400s B.C., the philosopher Socrates had a vital insight (a big bit of news) into what is needed for a good life. He argued that the first responsibility each person has towards themselves is to ‘know themselves.’ Every human needs to spend a good deal of their life getting to understand their motives, their prejudices, their ambitions and their frailties. We need to understand what we are really trying to do with our careers or why we so often get into in bitter rows with our partners or why every relationship we’ve been in fails or why we haven’t spoken to one of our cousins for six years, or why we get so anxious every Sunday evening. At the root of such mysteries is the fact that we don’t have full insight into our own motives and desires. Socrates’s momentous discovery is the amazing extent of our ignorance about ourselves. This discovery took place millennia ago, in a suburb of Athens. But it remains news, headline news, because the message has not yet been heard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Judged on the basis of importance, rather than sheer novelty, this piece of news from Athens deserves to go straight to the top of the agenda. It’s one of the enduring lead stories of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the wiser society, news would be thought of not just what happened in the last 24 hours, it could have happened at any time. The Utopian news organisation would understand that sometimes the real ‘news’ happened a long time ago. It deserves to be called news because it’s still important, it’s still relevant and most crucially, it’s still new to most people alive now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News would strive to be biased</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If the news is to matter to us, it must be presented to us by organisations that have tried to think through the ends of human life, that have a vision of where we are trying to go as a species, and that have somewhere articulated their answers to their audiences. Enough of fence-sitting organisations that never dare to say what they really think.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For example, it seems that for years, the BBC has blatantly attempted to put out news without any bias attached to it. In a complex world, it’s simply decided to try to be ‘neutral’, hoping that this will constitute the best possible defence of important things. When reporting on contentious issues, the BBC has tried to be – unforgivably – constantly ‘fair’ and scrupulous about ‘the facts’.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1489" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156715861.jpg" alt="Pro-Palestinian Protesters Demonstrate Outside The BBC Headquarters" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p3">Yet the BBC’s bias against bias seems fundamentally mistaken. Facts can only become meaningful and relevant to us when they slot into some picture of what is important or trivial, right or wrong, hopeful or worrying, good or bad. News organisations that vaunt their neutrality forget that neutrality is simply impossible vis-à-vis the biggest questions facing our civilisation. There is no technocratic, risk-free, all-knowing sober set of answers to cling to. It’s a question of politics in the widest sense, and in the end, if you like, of philosophy.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The issue is not – therefore – the illusory one between bias and fact but between better and worse varieties of bias. We shouldn’t knock America’s <i>Fox News</i> or Britain’s <i>Daily Mail</i> just on the basis that they are biased, though we might argue that they seem badly biased.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1490" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/72105574.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY: US-media-Fox  Fla" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Think of the figures we most revere in history: Plato, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Sigmund Freud, the Buddha, Ghandi, Nelson Mandela… Each of them had a strong sense of what mattered and why, and their judgements were anything but perfectly balanced. They were just biased in fruitful ways.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We don’t need news stripped of bias, we need news presented to us with the best kinds of bias.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">News organisations would employ comedians, artists and novelists</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">News organisations are overwhelmingly focused on gathering information – assuming that if the information is significant, it will go deep into our hearts and minds. But in truth, facts are rarely enough. We merely get bored and turn away when they’re heaped in front of us. In order to matter to us, news has to become skilled at entering our imaginations: it has to accept the resounding truth that bare information isn’t sufficient. To do justice to the material it handles every day, news needs to become a little more like art.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1491" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/136536181.jpg" alt="Human Sculpture Created At Henley Beach" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sadly, many of the things that we should give our attention to are very easily ignored day to day, like the slow increment of stresses in the environment or the distant suffering of others. A crucial fact may become abstract and – to us – meaningless.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are creatures designed for intimate contact, for local lives and personal relationships. For ideas to become powerful in our souls, they need to be anchored in experience. We need to feel them, see them. This is what art, at its best, lasers in on.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion: popularity and importance</b></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the most serious news would also be the most popular. We wouldn’t have the current fateful division between serious news (which no one takes in) and trivial news (which everyone is obsessed by).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, serious news would have learned a great deal from today’s tabloids. The aim would be to win popularity for what is important, useful, profound and good. It would be generous towards the ease with which we get distracted and the rapidity with which sympathy fades.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1492" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/82947407.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY SLIM ALLAGUI ---" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take the environment: the arctic ice is melting and this is going to have major, lasting implications for sea levels and weather around the world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A few people care a lot but, strangely and shamefully, Taylor Swift’s legs are far more captivating. They are lovely in ways that seem to defy description: somehow they look ordinary, yet perfect. They are long, yet not freakish. They seem unbowed by their implausible length; both utterly firm and yet yielding and soft.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1510905821.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4328" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1510905821.jpg?resize=635%2C667" alt="BuzzFoto Celebrity Sightings In New York - August 31, 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who take global warming seriously tend to get apoplectic at this point. They’re not wrong. While delightful, Taylor Swift’s legs are of little significance in comparison with the fate of the planet. But getting angry at our fascination with the thighs of a singer is counter-productive in a democracy. We cannot be collectively dragged into being more responsible through guilt. And for a very simple reason. We don’t have to pay attention. If those who care about arctic melt are going to get angry, bitter and stern, they’ll just be ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, we really do need to do something about that ice. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are interested in Taylor Swift’s legs not because we are evil – but because we are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make important news not just ‘important’, but also beguiling – almost as tempting to hear about as Taylor’s legs. Then things stand a chance of changing.</span></p>

The impulse to admire and have heroes is an important part of human nature.

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Human beings need role models. We therefore shouldn’t complain about or eradicate ‘celebrity culture.’ We need to improve it, bringing a better kind of person to the fore of public consciousness: we need better celebrities rather than no celebrities. </span></p>
<p class="p2">Alexander Lukashenko is an old-fashioned dictator of Belarus. He is often described as the last dictator in Europe. This doesn’t mean that he doesn’t care &#8211; in a way &#8211; about making his country a better place. Recently, he has run a nationwide competition to find a new raft of celebrities.</p>

<p class="p2">Elena is very good at milking cows. On her best ever day, she pumped over 1,100 litres from the herd into the tanks. And recently her prowess has been recognised by the government of Belarus. She has been named officially the &#8216;Best Milkmaid of the Slutsk region&#8217;, which lies just south of the capital Minsk. It&#8217;s like winning a major talent competition on TV in the West. Elena travelled to the capital to pick up an award from the President himself. She&#8217;s been in all the papers.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusB.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Sasha, too, has been honoured. He held the 2015 title of ‘Best Welder of the Republic’.</p>
<p>All countries, of course, stage competitions. We regularly award prizes for excellence at the long jump or in throwing darts at a board. These things are recreational, though, rather than focused on jobs or the ordinary activities of everyday life. In Belarus, the ambition is quite different. Elena and Sasha are national celebrities, the equivalent of hosts of television chat shows, supermodels and tycoons in other lands. They are seen as embodying ideals to which all should aspire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, young couples are encouraged to revere the example set by two other prize winners: Natalya and Konan, who have been awarded the prize for Belarus’s ‘Best Couple in Love’.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusC.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The public are requested to pay attention to how well they listen to each other, to admire their mutual trust and respect and to be touched (and inspired) by the delight they take in one another’s company.</p>
<p>And, to come to another prize, prospective parents will be invited to look up to Olga, winner of ‘The Best Mother of a Large family of the Smorgon region’.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusD.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>The awards handed out in Belarus are not ashamed to stress the virtues of very ordinary people. The winners become famous, but don’t at all look the way we have come to think that famous people should. Most people in the UK or Germany don’t look sufficiently smart or fashionable to be able to become famous. But Belarus has focused entirely on how good a person is at doing something basic and useful – like bringing up a family, working in a dairy or helping make tractors. These are the country’s only criteria of fame.</p>
<p class="p2"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/PM-060314-belarusE.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>It is very unfortunate if we associate these kinds of awards – which bestow celebrity status for excellence in ordinary things – just with oppressive regimes.</p>
<p>In fact, the good idea behind such awards is universal. It belongs as much – in fact, more so – in liberal states.</p>
<p>The core point is that a lot of things we should care about, and need to take seriously, are not currently well treated by the media machine that creates &#8216;celebrity culture&#8217;. But that&#8217;s no reason to despair of the idea of celebrity. We should take more seriously the task of creating &#8216;good celebrities&#8217;, good in the sense that one would be honouring people who demonstrate with particular clarity virtues that need to be more prominent in society. As part of this new venture to create <strong>Better Celebrities</strong>, one might &#8211; for example &#8211; set up prizes for:</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The introvert who most successfully managed to communicate what he/she felt to their partner&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The child who most generously forgave their parents&#8217;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The worker who most intelligently defused infighting at the office&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>And, the biggest prize of all: <strong>‘The Husband who best Learned to Control his Temper and Say Sorry.’</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The UK government, like so many around the world, is desperate to crack down on tax evasion. Too much money is being squirrelled away in tax havens like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands and the government desperately needs the cash. Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC: “The days of hiding money in another country to cheat the UK are coming to an end.”</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2159" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxA.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How then does the government propose to stop people evading taxes? By frightening them – with the help of a new multi-million pound advertising campaign. Posters will go up around the country from next week showing a pair of eyes staring at you through a gash in what is presumably meant to be your special reinforced bank locker. A caption announces: ‘We’re closing in on undeclared income,’ while in smaller type below, comes a message with a yet scarier intent: ‘If you’ve declared all your income you have nothing to fear.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2160" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxB.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re coming to get you</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to understand what led the government to this campaign. They are in deep trouble and want to do something about the missing billions fast and so fell for the most obvious tactic: trying to frighten people into paying up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it’s a very unhelpful move. In so doing, they are only reinforcing the very problem that causes tax evasion in the first place: the sense that paying tax is a highly unpleasant thing to do, forced upon the population by bossy, authoritarian governments, who will waste your precious money in bureaucratic nonsense and grandstanding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re missing a trick: instead of scaring people into paying tax, governments should seduce them into doing so – just like every successful charity in the world. They should show us, the citizenry, why our money could be so very helpful to the nation, how kind we would be to hand it over and how grateful the nation would be if we did so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2161" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxC.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Thank you for helping us to buy this</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Paying tax is the single most generous act we ever perform in relation to our fellow human beings. It’s via taxation that we acknowledge our debt to others and reinforce our common humanity. Yet how little joy this (forced) gift brings us! Whatever libertarians may claim, some of our money does truly go towards unambiguously good things: primary schools, mental health facilities, fire engines, the frail, the sick and that ambulance that just raced past you on its way to help an arthritic 83 year old who tripped on the stairs ten minutes ago.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet rather than evoking the benefits of tax, governments always frame payment in the most forbidding and hateful terms, as though they themselves didn’t quite trust in the justice of what they were getting us to do. They act with suspicion and aggression from the first. No one ever explains what good the tax money might do or bothers to say so much as a tiny thank you when the money does come in. It’s about the most unfulfilling huge donation one ever makes. No wonder people try everything to avoid paying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2162" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxD.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Oasis Academy Hadley</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">And so kind of you to chip in for this too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Governments should adopt a very different policy. Rather than resorting to fear, they should use charm. They should rehearse the sound arguments that exist as to why paying tax is a deeply noble act, the essence of transcending the ego. Rather than shaming the avoiders, it should melt their hearts. It should set up prizes for those who pay the most tax, rewarding them with honours, respect and love. It should reconnect us emotionally with the benefits of our contribution to the common good. It should show off the new ambulances and the freshly painted schools. And it should say thank you all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We would then end up feeling a lot better about what we had to pay for – and the nation would have to spend a lot less time and money terrifying its people into supporting their own communal needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2163" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-260214-taxE.jpg" alt="PM-260214-taxE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not a very helpful line either</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our society really admires it when rich people give away huge piles of surplus money towards the end of their lives, particularly when they donate large sums of it to the arts. It seems so noble and so good. What nice capitalists they are. How grateful we should be to have them in our midsts!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In recognition, sometimes these rich donors have a gallery named after them where their masterpieces hang, dinners are given in their honour and the odd title may be thrown their way. They really seem wonderful.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2574" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyA.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1">This big capitalist made lots of money in shopping malls; now he has given lots of it to preserve beautiful jugs in elegant glass cases</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take for instance Nasser David Khalili, one of the world’s richest men. Iranian born, resident in London, he amassed a fortune – in the many billions – building and selling shopping malls in far flung and rather challenging locations. His money safely accumulated, he has now begun to give away large chunks of it to philanthropic causes. As with many rich people, his dominant interest is art: the greatest share of his surplus wealth has been directed towards the acquisition and display of masterpieces in a variety of genres. He has sponsored exhibitions at the Hermitage in St Petersburg and the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris: he has given large sums to Oxford University and lent his art collection, revolving around Islamic masterpieces, to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In its combination of money-making and art, Khalili’s trajectory follows in the footsteps of great plutocrats like Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick or Andrew Mellon. They made money in so-called ‘low’ areas of the economy; like coal mining, railways, abattoirs, and packing factories – areas where you squeeze costs as tightly as you can and are always looking to reduce benefits as much as possible. However, once the money is in the bank, these rich people wholeheartedly turn their attention to ‘higher’ causes – among which art (and all that it celebrates, like kindness, beauty and tenderness) looms especially large.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-140314-moneyB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4196" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-140314-moneyB.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="PM-140314-moneyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Henry Clay Frick: made a fortune from abusing the efforts of thousands of steel workers, then built an art gallery full of fine and tender things:</span></h5>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Blackened faces and bent backs helped to bring about this moment</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We suggest a different path. It’s not ideal to ignore the higher needs of mankind for many decades while pulling together an astonishing fortune and then, later in life, suddenly to rediscover these higher needs via an act of immense generosity towards some localised little shrine of art (an opera house or a museum). Would it not be better and truer to the values underlying many works of art, to strive throughout the course of one’s life, especially within the money-generating day-job, to make kindness, tenderness, sympathy and beauty more alive and real in the world?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tantalisingly and tragically, the difference between beauty and ugliness, goodness and cruelty is in most enterprises a few percentage points of profit. Therefore, for the sake of just a tiny bit of surplus wealth, wealth that isn’t strictly even needed, human life is daily being degraded and sacrificed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Would it not be more humane if rich business people agreed to sacrifice a little of their surplus wealth in their main area of activity and in the most vigorous period of their lives, in order to render the workplace more noble and humane – and then bothered less with dazzling displays of artistic philanthropy in their later decades? Would it not have been better for all of us if rather than making money through selling Scotland’s hideous Cameron Toll shopping centre only then to give a portion of the cash away to the Hermitage Museum, Mr Khalili had made slightly less money, but done so through building beautiful shops and houses that could have enhanced the tenor of everyday life across the modern world?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we’re asking for is enlightened investment where a lower return is sought on capital in the name of Kindness and Goodness. There would be less fancy art at the end of it, but the values within works of art would be far more widely spread across the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2577" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyD.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ugliness sponsors beauty: The profits from here ended up helping the Hermitage museum</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason why the present system survives has to do with the way status is offered. This is a key part of the jigsaw and we ignore it at our peril. The rich currently get a huge amount of status from making big philanthropic donations to the arts. However, they would get no respect – indeed only pity and disbelief – if they claimed to be limiting their wealth-making potential by running their businesses in ways that made daily life slightly nicer for employees and society. There is more status to be found in exploiting mines, rainforests and call centres with ruthless abandon for three decades then, your animal energies having run dry, putting on a black tie jacket and funding an opera house or museum of 17th century still-life from the proceeds. This strategy has to it a glamour far greater than the infinitely more humane and therefore in the deep sense ‘artistic’ task of steadily building a more agreeable world for people at a modest 3% annual rate of return, which at the end of life, leaves you little except for the inherent satisfaction of having done something worthwhile with your years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enlightened Capitalism requires new kinds of patrons interested in making money, but willing to sacrifice returns for the sake of higher goals. Take London’s Regent’s Park and Regent’s Street. They are both beautifully elegant and brilliantly commercial developments. People like to visit them even now.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2578" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyE.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might learn from the attitude of the guy who built them, the Prince Regent, later George IV. The Prince had more than one motive for the huge scheme. Certainly he wanted and needed some money from leasing the new buildings. So there was a Capitalist base to the project. But he also wanted to make a fine and permanent contribution to the beauty and grandeur of his capital city – and was prepared to take a huge hit on his profit levels to guarantee this. He succeeded in both aims.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The rich are a product of capitalism, but they are ideally suited to correct some of the problems: They can afford to take some of the risks to get capitalism to address our higher needs &#8211; w<strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">hich means bearing risk (rather than simply writing off the money (which is the idea of philanthropy). Profitability should be the eventual goal and is important because it i</span></strong>s a signal that enough people value something that they have become ready to pay for it: it is a sign that one has worked out how to get the value of the product authentically into people’s lives.</p>
<p class="p1">Rather than idolise or excoriate the rich, we should work out what private wealth good is for. If there are going to be rich people, what role should they ideally be playing? And what would potentially be missing in a society where no-one as rich? At the moment the rich tend to be seen as having to two duties to society: poverty alleviation and art philanthropy. These ways of giving back to society can seem, at first, rather nice. But they run up against serious problems. Even though a rich individual has &#8211; of course &#8211; a huge amount of money in comparison with most people, they are still puny in comparison with the scale of the issue. Their resources won’t go far. Someone with a billion pounds could give GBP 15 to each person in the UK &#8211; or 13p to everyone on the planet. It would be an astonishing gesture, but would produce no lasting benefit. Poverty alleviation is really important but an individual giving away their money can’t solve it. It requires the actions of the state.</p>
<p class="p1">As for artistic patronage: Art is surely a lovely thing. But even more valuable are the sort of things that the works of art we love celebrate: kindness, empathy, goodness, beauty. At the end of the day, it is far better that these qualities have more of a place in our offices and factories than that we add yet another museum or ‘masterpiece’ to the nation’s collection. It’s far closer to the real spirit of art to run a factory that’s attractive, to be kind to workers, and to treat colleagues well than to bully, fight and exploit for a lifetime, then give a Renoir to the National Gallery in one’s last years.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2579" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-moneyF.jpg" alt="PM-140314-moneyF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t buy the picture and give it to the nation; try to make the sweetness and kindness in the picture more possible in day to day life (for example, by giving workers more time off to be with their families)</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s late and, across the nation, people are sinking back into the soft corners of sofas, clutching glasses of wine and TV remote controls and numbing their minds with soothing images and sounds. The working day is done. Everyone has earned a break.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/commuters.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4198" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/commuters.jpg?resize=635%2C388" alt="Commuters Struggle With Over Crowding On Train Routes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a few people are still hard at work. They are at their desks making their way through labyrinths of documents, sifting columns of figures, hammering out emails, taking calls and struggling to master waves of exhaustion and anxiety.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3330" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/450616087.jpg" alt="Obama Speaks At Wall Street Journal CEO Council Annual Meeting" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 dir="ltr">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are the rich. Rupert Murdoch labours night and day. Gina Rinehart (the wealthiest woman in the world) is fanatically industrious. Warren Buffett is still hard at it. Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, puts in massive hours. So does Jamie Dimon at the helm of JP Morgan Chase. Their frenzied labours are one of the strangest – but most significant – sights of modern Capitalism. Those who are already wealthy keep their noses firmly to the grindstone. And not just these few titans, but the hundreds and thousands of less well known but also highly successful entrepreneurs, the guiding spirits and great beneficiaries of the modern economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do the rich of today keep on working? Why do they enter stressful negotiations, constantly take on large risks, battle ambitious, hard-hearted rivals, and scheme and plot until the day they collapse? What are they doing it for? Why aren’t they satisfied with the extensive assets and large piles of money they already have?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ironically, the one thing the hard-working rich don’t actually want and are not in any way motivated by is money itself. They have far more than enough of that already and they know it. Their every material need is catered for (one can nowadays buy a comfortable life for a year using what they earn in a day). Nor – at this point in the history of civilisation – are the rich likely to be working for the sake of their children. There are too many examples of large fortunes that have driven kids insane with guilt for any modern plutocrat to be able to tell themselves that they are doing it for the next generation.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t the money</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rich are not, therefore, working to make more money with an eye to spending it. They are making money in order to be liked. They are doing so for the sake of status, as a way of keeping score and letting the world know of their value as human beings. The rich work for love and for honour. They stay up late at the office out of vanity – because they want to be able to walk into rooms full of strangers and be swiftly recognised by those that matter and deemed miraculous and clever for having made fortunes, whose size is carefully recorded by the media the world over.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In many cases, this works out well for everyone. There is often no conflict between the insatiable vanity of corporate chiefs and the requirements of society. That is one of the miracles of Capitalism, first observed by Adam Smith: the system can put personal selfishness to work for the public good. Capitalism doesn’t have to rely on kindness or virtue, which makes it infinitely more robust than rival economic arrangements, the kind that explicitly demand that those in charge have pure hearts (Communism). Under certain circumstances, corporations driven only by the profit motive can pass two key tests: they can treat their employees extremely well and they can produce excellent goods and services. Private vice can give rise to public virtue: companies can pay thousands of workers handsome salaries and fill shops across nations with wholesome necessary goods – and at the same time, the CEO’s at the helm may be deeply unpleasant, asocial and narcissistic types who pay not even one passing thought to the genuine needs of the societies they in fact serve so well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s how it should work. But sadly, too often, it no longer does. Under the pressure of the raw profit motive, two things are happening: workers are increasingly abused (their salaries and conditions are reduced to an inhumane minimum) and the quality of products is grievously undermined (corners are cut, false claims are made, the best promises of the company are sacrificed). And paradoxically, all this unhappiness flows from one cause only: the need to continue filling the bank accounts of people who don’t – as we’ve learnt – truly even want money for its own sake, people who only want money to be loved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surveying the problems of Capitalism, the standard response of the left has been to suggest that one simply tax the rich more. But this fails to grasp, and therefore properly to exploit, the real psychological motives of the rich. The rich only pursue money fanatically (to our great collective cost) because wealth appears to be the primary, most objective source of honour in the modern world. If only we can fix how honour is obtained, we will be able to redirect their mania to more socially beneficial ends in ways that don’t demand that the rich become ‘nice’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, a natural inclination is to force the rich to give up their wealth using the instrument of new taxes, but this strategy simply won’t work. The chances of people running away and taking their assets with them is too great. We know that entrepreneurial energy and competitive drive can too easily be depleted; the economic balloon can deflate and all will suffer. We need to go down a different route. We need to harness the talents and drives that the rich are currently using to squeeze the earth and its people too hard – and ensure that these energies are made to address  the collective needs of society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim should be to seduce the rich – to make them want to benefit their societies in return for giving them what (we know) they deep down really want but haven’t until now reliably been able to get except through money: namely, honour.</span></p>

<h6 dir="ltr">© Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">There are few motives as powerful as the desire for honour</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough that societies can motivate people very powerfully through honour: soldiers will perform extraordinary feats on the battlefield in return for the highest gratitude from their countries (they don’t even ask to be paid very much – paid to die…). Scientists will labour in poverty for decades in the hope of winning a Nobel Prize. Yet as societies, we are only just beginning to explore what good can come out of vanity in the realm of business. In the commercial world, there are at present no systematic, fail-safe methods for gaining status in return for doing what society desperately needs capitalists to do: treat their workers well and produce useful, safe, environmentally-sound goods and services. In some countries, there may be the odd hope of a medal from the president or the queen if one behaves well, but the chances of securing one are simply too remote and unpredictable to motivate hard-headed capitalists in their actions from day to day: it remains far more rational to peg one’s hopes for status on the verifiable criterion of money than on the vague chance of an invitation from the palace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is precisely what needs to be changed – and urgently. Society should do a systematic deal with capitalists: it should give them the honour and love they so badly crave in exchange for treating their workers as human beings, not abusing customers and properly looking after the planet. A standard test should be drawn up to measure the societal good generated by companies (many such schemes already exist in nascent form), on the basis of which capitalists should then be given extraordinarily prestigious titles by their nations in ceremonies with the grandeur and thrill of film premieres or sporting finales. It might be something to go after their names (for example, RC: Responsible Capitalist), a title that would have some of the same associations as the Nobel Prize, the Victoria Cross and the Pulitzer prize – in other words, a fitting target for the most ambitious and narcissistically craven and damaged people in society to strive for.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Martin Mills, chairman of music company Beggars Group, being given an OBE. This should happen a lot more often, and far more systematically</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The founding figure of modern economics, Adam Smith, adroitly recognised the two chief motivating factors in human life: the love of riches and the love of glory. He knew that these two things are what people ultimately want and what they work hardest for.  A wise society must therefore learn how to harness the love of glory at times, like now, when the public good comes into conflict with the love of riches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need the energy of the entrepreneurs, we need their drive and their determination. But if these business people continue to be motivated by unchecked profit alone, we will all go to ruin. Matters have become unsustainable, the disparities and absurdities too great. To solve the problem, we don’t have to wait until the rich miraculously grow magnanimous or kind. And we’ll be sure to have no luck trying to impose new taxes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdamSmith-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4202" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AdamSmith-1.jpg?resize=635%2C607" alt="AdamSmith-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">He knew, you have to give them gongs and ribbons</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, wise societies that have properly understood the psychology of the rich now have a trump card to play. As Adam Smith put it, “The great secret of education is to direct vanity to proper objects.” That is, we should target the vanity of the rich and encourage them to act well from that most powerful of desires: the desire to be loved. Our side of the deal will be to applaud very heartily when they behave well and to ensure we lavish upon them all the respect they so deeply crave. It will be a very small price to pay in return for the contentment of the planet.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When we see a picture of the siblings of celebrities, we instinctively think, ‘poor things’. What must it be like if your brother or sister were hugely famous and admired by millions?</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsA-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4265" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsA-1.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="PM-190214-siblingsA-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Oh dear, my brother has become president.</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We think like this because we are instinctively aware of envy. We understand how having a famous brother or sister could make you feel deeply, thoroughly inadequate. The comparison would be so humiliating and saddening. We’d constantly ask: why not me? We all know envy when it comes at us in sibling form, so we feel for them a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4258" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsB.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="Brad Pitt, Doug Pitt and Brad's nephew exit Dave &amp; Busters in Times Square with Maddox Jolie-Pitt and Pax Thien Jolie-Pitt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Jackson Lee/Splash</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Being Brad Pitt’s brother</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our instinctive awareness of the difficulties of being a sibling to a famous person takes us to the heart of how envy works. We don’t envy everyone equally. We envy people who we feel in some ways equal to, but who for one reason or another have achieved things we haven’t. There’s therefore no one we feel more equal to than those who grew up around us in our own family. They had the same advantages and disadvantages. We know them so well. They are in our heads all the time. Then why are we not the president, the film star or the plutocrat? Why didn’t it happen to us? Now that they have them, their advantages have ceased to be abstract things that no ordinary mortal has: they become quite realistic propositions – from which one is excluded. It’s crushing and, on some days, just unbearable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3002" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-siblingsC.jpg" alt="PM-190214-siblingsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Stone and her sister</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, increasingly in the modern world, everyone feels like a sibling to everyone else. That’s because we live in societies with a very social egalitarian spirit (note: they aren’t actually egalitarian at all but the mood is deeply relaxed and we’re encouraged to think that anyone can do anything, just so long as they work hard and put their minds to it). This is nice, but it potentially turns everyone into that most awkward thing: a sibling-like person. ‘Why shouldn’t I be like them?’, is the natural question we now ask of more and more people.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4260" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-siblingsD.jpg?resize=635%2C487" alt="PARTY VH1/Adams" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Victoria Beckham’s sister</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to go easy on ourselves. We are ready to see how tough it must be to be related to Barack or Brad. But we’re as yet slower to see that – in key ways – we are in exactly the same position ourselves already vis à vis lots of people, who are slowly driving us mad with their achievements. We have an almost spontaneous impulse to be kind and understanding around a sibling of Victoria Beckham or Sharon Stone. We need to be as kind to ourselves. The toys have been very unfairly or arbitrarily distributed. That’s an OK thing to feel sad and anxious about a lot of the time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nastiness is currently deeply prestigious in the world of news. An interviewer who makes a politician look stupid and mean is on track to become a hero.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It started off with politicians. Now it’s spread to almost any target conceivable. We get a secret pleasure when new films are eviscerated by a reviewer. There’s a warm reception for scathing denunciations of sports stars. There’s a ready audience for anything that paints the Prime Minister or President as a shallow fool; we approve when the people running banks are dismissed as venal idiots, or celebrities as pampered, ageing and cheating airheads. Journalists around the world have made careers for themselves being nasty about everyone who comes under their remit. Entire sections of news outlets (<em>Private Eye, New York Observer</em> and <em>Gawker</em>) are given over to vicious, throwaway assessments of other humans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4268" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessB.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="PM-070314-nicenessB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Twitter</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An empire of ‘meanness’ stretching from Michael Fassbender to Nigel Farage to Matt LeBlanc to Bernie Ecclestone. The UK Sunday Times’s chief interviewer, Camilla Long</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we have a good time with ‘mean news’, we don’t think we are being pointlessly cruel. We just feel that we don’t have much power in the world, that there are lots of things wrong out there and that nastiness is the best, sharpest way to respond to sickness and evil. We’re being harsh, yes, – we think – but we’re calling time on illusion and nonsense. If we get furious and put the boot in, the world has a chance of becoming the better, kinder, saner place we’d like to see.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2998" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070314-nicenessC.jpg" alt="PM-070314-nicenessC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Twitter</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marina Hyde of the Guardian: a weekly dose of acid</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the prestige of nastiness rests on some deeply confused assumptions – which run counter to the best ideals of journalism. Yes, it is the task of journalism to be sceptical, to probe beneath the official story and to ask awkward questions in order to uncover the truth. But meanness has nothing to do with this sort of patient forensic scepticism towards complex situations. Meanness has already made up its mind, it knows the story before it even begins to assemble it: it is convinced (through prejudgement) that something or someone is awful, it has shut its ears to any other information, and just wants to kick the boot in with brio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4269" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessA.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="Graham Norton Show - London" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">‘Why are you lying to me, you lying bastard?’</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Journalists sent to interview the extreme right wing French politician Marie Le Pen show all the pitfalls of ‘mean journalism’ in action. Almost all decide ahead of time that they dislike her heartily and see an interview as an occasion to mock, pass swift judgement and deal in insults. This is terrific fun for the audience of left-leaning readers in the cafes of Paris and Bordeaux.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4271" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessE.jpg?resize=635%2C468" alt="France National Front" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that mean journalism towards this woman has done nothing to help mainstream France understand where the National Front is coming from; what it wants, where it draws its support from and what one might do to tame it. Mean journalism has traded the truth for the satisfactions of cheap insult. Meanness disguises that Marie Le Pen articulates real anxieties among French people about the direction of their country. To acknowledge this is hardly to subscribe to her policies. But it recognises a crucial and disturbing fact about a major nation, which ‘nastiness’ merely bats away. The only fruitful way to proceed is to be ‘nice’: not in the sense of naive sentimentality but in the sense of wanting to enter into the mindset of another person, even one who deeply challenges your beliefs.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3007" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070314-nicenessF.jpg" alt="School Reform Murdoch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take another characteristic hate figure. Plenty of people are comfortable loathing Rupert Murdoch. They’ve done so for years. It’s rather reassuring. They see him as a barbarian, with deeply sinister motives; he’s wrong about everything and very dangerous. To be ‘nice’ to him feels inconceivable. Yet if we’re ever to understand what he represents, why he is successful and how we might effectively oppose him, a degree of patient humane civility is going to be key.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Central to competing with Murdoch and what he represents is to understand how he has been so successful. This is not to like him or to admire what he has done. Yet to belittle his support base or achievements is folly. If the most strident opponents of Murdoch were nicer – if they tried to grasp how he sees things from his point of view, and understand in a sympathetic way what his audiences like about the things he offers – then it would be possible to mount a proper protest against him – and make inroads into his market share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds mad to argue that we should be nice to the likes of Le Pen or Murdoch. That’s because we’ve unfortunately confused being nice with a couple of things we rightly fear: being naive and being weak. Listening carefully to what someone says, trying to see the world through their eyes, this has nothing at all to do with agreement. If you start with a determined intent to humiliate someone, their opponents are delighted (because it confirms their prejudices) and yet you arrive at no insight into how to win the hearts and minds of the very many people who really do like what Murdoch or Le Pen have to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessG.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4273" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070314-nicenessG.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="Paris Hilton grilled at Japan airport" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Saying she’s an obnoxious, spoiled, rich brat is an admission of defeat</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Or take Paris Hilton. What’s gone wrong with the woman can’t be put right by screaming at her. Being nasty is a natural response. It just doesn’t change anything.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should think of being nice as an expression of confident strength; it’s a show of being secure enough to examine points of view that feel foreign to your own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need the news to be nice, not in the sense of reporting only on cuddly, sweet things. But in the sense of operating with a tone that is generous, curious and civil. Awful things won’t go away because we mock them. But if we understand them, see where they are coming from, and treat their advocates and supporters as fellow human beings, we have much more chance of dealing with them successfully – and therefore of making the world a better place.</span></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Auckland mayor Len Brown has been having an affair. News but not new</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet there’s a strange thing that goes on. After a while it becomes clear that the same kinds of events are recurring again and again. The details of the story change, but the core issue is the same. In New Zealand, the mayor of Auckland recently got into huge trouble for sexting his mistress and for abusing his travel budget. In Australia at much the same time a Queensland MP – and head of the state ethics committee – had an affair, and there were sexual photos and allegations of misuse of public money. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then it was reported that US Secret Service agents around the world had been hiring prostitutes, visiting brothels and having extra marital affairs. Meanwhile, in the UK the man who had been, until shortly before, running the Co-Op bank was caught up in a sex and drugs scandal. A while back, there was an American president who…</span></p>

<h5 class="p3"><span class="s1">It’s been going on a while</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of these stories circle round the same archetypal story. It goes like this: Men in highly responsible positions are coming unstuck because their sexual desires lead them to do things that, when made public, are shameful. Really there is just one story here which is being repeated. What could be seen as four (or, over a year, 40 or 400) different news items actually belong to just a single story. There is a lot less news than we suppose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for archetypes – for the basic patterns which recur many times – is not just a game. Identifying the underlying theme is more important in the long run than going through the details of every specific case. The big news – the news that matters – is not so much that this particular MP or mayor or banker or leader did what they did. What we need to address is why such things happen. It is the archetype that takes us to the nub of this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are also large number of stories about celebrities doing ordinary things. Prince William has a child and copes perfectly well with the car seat and the nappies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4283" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-lessnewsC.jpg?resize=635%2C694" alt="Birth of Prince George of Cambridge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">Famous person does ordinary thing</h5>
<p class="p4">It’s fascinating to hear these stories. But when we home in on the common factor – the archetype – the real news emerges. The archetype goes like this: Powerful and famous people do the same things as ordinary mortals, leaving the public slightly stunned, yet cheered. The famous shed a little bit of welcome glamour, a kind of grace, on humdrum actions. When we’re stressing to fit the baby car seat in the back or when we get a take-away coffee and have to drink it in the rain, we realise that we are not – as we might normally feel – suffering an irritating indignity or a banal humiliation – we are in fact sharing the life of the stars; not because we are making ourselves like them, but for a deeper and more moving reason: they are like us.</p>
<p class="p4"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4668619171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5158" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4668619171.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="Celebrity Sightings In Los Angeles - February 04, 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of an archetype is to simplify the vast number of things which are going on at any one time. If we were more conscious of archetypes, we’d have to take in a lot less news. That’s why news organisations don’t normally want to tell you about archetypes (ad revenue would go down). We don’t mind.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve grown up expecting that the task of the news is to introduce us to important information which we will need to lead our lives – and by this we tend to mean information relating to problematic dynamics at the level of national and international life (a war, a debt crisis, the resignation of a politician).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4287" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayA.jpg?resize=635%2C709" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, one kind of news story which is oddly, and often embarrassingly popular is one which lies entirely outside the remit of news as serious people define it. It is a story in which an attractive or accomplished person is witnessed going about a minor task of daily life. The story may pivot around an event of complete ordinariness, there is a complete absence of drama, suffering or hysteria. Perhaps they’ve gone out to buy some bread or maybe they are walking the dog. It may be quite sunny. The dog looks happy. The flowers are out. Anne Hathaway has, for example, recently been spotted going out for a walk with her chocolate labrador and a lot of people are interested and charmed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might want to look at 10 or 15 photos relating to this and some news outlets wisely satisfy our interest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3043" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayB.jpg" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<h5 class="p1">Still we want a bit more:</h5>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3044" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayC.jpg" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">And a bit more</h5>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4288" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-hathawayD.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="**WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT** Anne Hathaway and Esmeralda leave a Christmas treat on a paparazzo's car" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6> © AKM-GSI/Splash News</h6>
<h5 class="p2">And a bit more still</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweet though the photos are we might catch ourselves wondering what on earth we are doing spending our time looking at them. The feeling is we should be doing something more important, more worthwhile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We shouldn’t feel bad. The doubts we might feel about looking at pictures of Anne Hathaway walking her dog are largely caused by accidental snobbery. We are liable to look down on an activity which, if it were presented to us in a museum, we might take very seriously. And yet what we’re doing here – looking at a pleasant person talking a walk – is not fundamentally different from the pleasures available in an art gallery. If we went on a special trip to Giverny to see Monet’s paintings we’d hardly think we were doing something a bit low-brow or pointless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet when we look at his lovely <em>Wild Poppies near Argenteuil</em> we are – in many respects – doing exactly the same as when we look at Anne and her dog.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3047" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-hathawayH.png" alt="PM-290114-hathawayH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<h5 class="p1">Monet looked at people going for a walk in a field</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just that when a frame is put round a picture and when it becomes famous we are much more generous to it (and to ourselves) and appreciative of what it has to offer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Monet was a great artist in part because he wanted to draw our attention to times when nothing important seems to be going on. In the Wild Poppies picture it’s just an ordinary day; they’ve probably gone on the walk hundreds of times. Monet is telling us that in just looking at someone going for a walk we are doing something worth taking seriously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the task of the news is to tell us important things, then we shouldn’t define importance too narrowly. Part of what we need is to stay hopeful about the human project. Hope is an achievement and we find it in these sort of scenes – scenes where no one is dying or suffering, where things are attractive, where there is an absence of sickness and in which everyday, quiet, ordinary contentment is glimpsed.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The church of the fourteen helpers in Bavaria was built about two hundred and fifty years ago. But, strange as it might sound, the ideas that led to its construction are more important than ever.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At that time, the Catholic Church wanted to enforce a specific moral. They wanted to say that everyday compassion and care, however humble and ordinary it might look from the outside, is hugely important. The Church wanted to make this message more active in people’s lives, edging us away from our natural selfishness and busy indifference. They had a key idea about something important and wanted to bring more people on board.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3066" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg" alt="PM-050214-monbiotA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">The carrot</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were also keen to avoid a technique which they’d been trying for centuries and that hadn’t worked so well: that of terrifying and guilt-tripping people into being good. So, in this part of Southern Germany, for a time at least, they settled on a different, much more intelligent technique. They weren’t going to talk about hell and damnation any more, they were going to try to seduce people into being good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4290" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg?resize=633%2C566" alt="PM-050214-monbiotB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The stick</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making people better is a task that obsesses a lot of people today as well. In the last few days, for example, the Guardian newspaper has sought to get its readers to care more about many bad things: not enough women sitting on government panels, excess pay at the top of UK companies, parents who don’t play enough with their children, excessive reliance on private transport, and too many hamburgers from fast-food restaurants. That is just the start. The Guardian’s strategy to overcome laziness, greed and sin is to induce a persistent feeling of guilt in the reader. There could only be a single conclusion were you not to care about the issues being outlined: you are a bit mean, rather callous and quietly complicit with repression and cruelty.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3068" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-050214-monbiotC.jpg" alt="PM-050214-monbiotC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The limits of guilt</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The urge to nag is very understandable. The problem is it’s not terribly effective. It will work for a small number of people but for most of us it is off-putting. We instinctively resent being told we are heartless when we we are just harassed; we are already doing our best to be decent people.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The Bavarian church is important today because it explores a very different approach. It doesn’t nag, it does not issue stern warnings or upbraid us for being selfish. It does not make us feel guilty about our failings.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4291" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="PM-050214-monbiotD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Uplift</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead the architect used every possible means to persuade people through excitement, pleasure, awe and delight. The interlocking domes and vaults are exceptionally beautiful – inducing a mood of lightness and vitality. It is splendid – but for a reason. It is expressing the true glory of modest goodwill. It wants to seduce us, charm us, into kindness. It acknowledges we might need a lot of encouragement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a big lesson here for modern culture. There are so many serious things we need collective persuading about. The rich need to be persuaded to be much more generous than they are currently being, bankers need to be encouraged to be more prudent around money, we should be more cautious about damaging the environment, more considered about what we eat and nicer to our children. Good ideas about all of these matters are very prominent already. But the news has to date largely attempted to motivate us by guilt, rather than charm us into goodness.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Maybe it is time to take a broad lesson from one rather extraordinary church in Bavaria.</p>
<p class="p2">Let&#8217;s zero in on a specific example: the arctic ice is melting and this is going to have major, lasting implications for sea levels and weather around the world.</p>
<p>A few people care a lot but, strangely and shamefully, Taylor Swift’s legs are far more captivating. They are lovely in ways that seem to defy description: somehow they look ordinary, yet perfect. They are long, yet not freakish. They seem unbowed by their implausible length; both utterly firm and yet yielding and soft.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-swiftA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4278" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-swiftA1.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="EXCLUSIVE Taylor Swift,Hailee Steinfeld,  Jessica Szohr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© WENN.com</h6>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Thrilling</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who take global warming seriously tend to get apoplectic at this point. They’re not wrong. While delightful, Taylor Swift’s legs are of little significance in comparison with the fate of the planet. But getting angry at our fascination with the thighs of a singer is counter-productive in a democracy. We cannot be collectively dragged into being more responsible through guilt. And for a very simple reason. We don’t have to pay attention. If those who care about arctic melt are going to get angry, bitter and stern, they’ll just be ignored.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3018" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-swiftC.jpg" alt="Antarctica Mission" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Boring</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The problem is, we really do need to do something about that ice. But the starting point has to be indulgence towards the way our minds work. We are interested in Taylor Swift’s legs not because we are evil – but because we are wired in unhelpful ways. If we are going to be interested en masse in the defrosting poles, we need to take our fragilities on board and therefore get serious, very serious, about trying to make important news not just ‘important’, but also beguiling – almost as tempting to hear about as Taylor’s legs. Then things stand a chance of changing.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3019" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-290114-swiftD.jpg" alt="Cold Weather" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p3">Not appealing – just important</h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="post-1113" class="post-1113 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized">
<p class="entry-title"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things seem to be going really well with the institution of the art museum. All the big cities have one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, new ones are popping up constantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the lines to get into blockbuster shows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can snake around the block</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the buzz, museums are arguably not doing as much for us as they might; their whole purpose and function in modern society has been left oddly rather unexplored. Many of us show up at these museums more out of guilt than genuine pleasure. The prestige of art &#8211; as opposed to any spontaneous enthusiasm &#8211; is what seems to keep a sizeable share of people coming through the doors. And a lot of the more recent art on display can be deeply puzzling to behold &#8211; even if we don’t generally reveal our confusion for fear of seeming foolish. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9010" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="6862251961_75aafbcbc3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the problem of the art museum is an institutional inability to define in simple terms what art might actually be for and quite why it should matter so much. We may be heartily convinced of art’s importance, but we have a devilishly hard time pinning the significance down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a suggestion: the purpose of art is therapeutic. It is there to lend inspiration and consolation in relation to a number of the challenges of being human. Art helps us to cope with, among other things:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inability to focus on what is beautiful and precious in life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our tendency to caricature others and forget about their sufferings </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inclination to lose hold of our inherent creativity and playfulness </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our frustrated longings to create better societies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and our need for stillness, perspective and solemnity in an angry chaotic world</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9011" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time.jpg?resize=453%2C604" alt="Richard_Serra-The_Matter_of_Time" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it may be fashionable to say otherwise, art is definitely not there just ‘for art’s sake.’ It is a tool to help us to live and die well; it opens our eyes, it returns us to a sense of creativity, it connects us with strangers, it shakes us from political complacency, it stills our agitated hearts. Art has a healing function.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives us all we need to define what an art museum should be:</span></p>
<p><b>An institution that displays and arranges art in ways that can best heal its audiences.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a stark and deliberately vulgar definition would have revolutionary implications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, most art museums are laid out chronologically </span>as if the most important thing about works of art was when they were made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with a better focus on the function of art, works could now be rearranged according to the distinctive troubles of the soul they could help us with.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4468203053_45b75c4385_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9013" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4468203053_45b75c4385_b.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="4468203053_45b75c4385_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be a gallery devoted to addressing The Agonies of Love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another focused on helping us cope with Anxiety; a third devoted to issues of Envy</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fourth to Aging and so on&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Entire museums might bite off one part of a therapeutic emotional curriculum.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be a Museum for Calm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that would collect a range of works that helped to usher in this prized mood from across all centuries and media. There could be A Museum for Creativity; A Museum for Friendship &#8211; and so on. Some might be very big. Others quite small. They might exist online or in a narrow space between a pub and a kebab shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10871847465_207c925b47_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9012" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10871847465_207c925b47_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="10871847465_207c925b47_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You often hear it said that ‘museums of art are our new cathedrals’: in other words, that art can heal us as religions once did. It’s an intriguing and vital idea which art museums haven’t in fact taken up, because while they expose us to objects of genuine importance, they seem unable to curate them in ways that link them powerfully to our inner needs. Our new cathedrals are underperforming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should give up on the idea of the art museum as some kind of dead storage space for the history of the subject or a whitewashed cavern that stays intimidatingly silent as to its purpose. The art museum deserves to be reborn as a kind of superior chemist or drugstore, that vividly signposts art and culture and uses it to bring inspiration, solace and meaning to our confused, anxious and troubled societies.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you asked an average customer-oriented bank what they were in the business of doing, they&#8217;d look at you rather strangely, as if you were asking them something so obvious, you might be taking them for fools. Evidently, banks exist to keep money safe, to make it grow and to deliver it swiftly to their customers when they need it.</p>
<p>In highly competitive times, banks will do their hardest to demonstrate prowess in these three areas. They will let the world know that they are a safe haven, that they are extremely adept at making portfolios grow and that they respond with unparalleled rapidity to customer demands. Some are even open 24 hours a day. One could, in a generous moment, even feel rather sorry for banks given the sweat they must expend competing in these areas. It is extremely hard to grow a portfolio more than 4.5% per annum, never more so than when markets are relentlessly saggy or volatile.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6055376303_19f39774b3_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9512" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/6055376303_19f39774b3_b.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6055376303_19f39774b3_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only when we insist on the original question that the founding assumptions behind modern banking reveal some of their strangeness. What really do we want from banks? And then the real enquiry: what do we want from money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is probably not clever to be overly sophisticated here, at least not initially: we simply want to be happy. We want money not to cause us anxiety and to be responsible for increasing our sense of well-being. But this is where the issues start, for happiness around money is no simple matter. The modern assumption is rather immodest and blatant: we insist that all we need to be happy with money is to have more and more of it. This represents the sum total of the complexity we (or rather, classical economics) generally allow into the topic.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5559517904_825589a166_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9517" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/5559517904_825589a166_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="5559517904_825589a166_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even banks filled with people with advanced qualifications and armies of computers tend not to question these assumptions very much. There may be immense intelligence within banks but it is solely directed towards the big bold agenda: making money grow. But the subject of money and happiness is &#8211; evidently &#8211; just a little more complicated than this orientation would assume. To reach happiness around money is to embark on a journey full of unexpected currents and hidden whirlpools. We can quickly summon up just a few of the complexities:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- How happy our money makes us isn’t just a question of the amount we have; it partly depends on how we have made it. The more pleasurable the process of accumulation, the less substantial the overall sum might need to be (and vice versa).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9520" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8244819328_c9ddee84ed_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We want to earn money to provide money for our families, on the assumption that money is what they need but providing them with more than a certain amount seems to have odd side-effects. Giving people we love too much money can land them up in clinics.</span></p>
<p>&#8211; It’s nice to give money away and goodness knows people need help: but where &#8211; really &#8211; does money make a difference? And what causes feel close to our own hearts?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9522" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="18638097114_26fd15f2dd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- How much money we feel we need is a decision highly dependent on what others in the immediate vicinity &#8211; our reference points &#8211; are making. Feeling comfortably-off relies on measuring ourselves against targets which lie outside our control and upon which we generally reflect very little. There are perhaps two ways to feel richer: to make more money &#8211; or to change our friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It’s hard to know what to spend money on in order to be genuinely satisfied. We’re provided with constant temptations and encouragements to invest in this or that: but which of these really work for us? We have to understand ourselves quite well to know how to spend. Shopping is an oddly serious matter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/262222699_d7234420b4_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9526" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/262222699_d7234420b4_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="262222699_d7234420b4_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Anxiety is a constant: we worry about everything. A lot of this anxiety gets channelled, of course, towards money. If only we reach a certain goal, then &#8211; at last &#8211; we will be stable and secure. But how skilled is money at answering the hopes we have placed in it? We are exhausting ourselves in search of money: how accurate are we being in our hopes for it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank of the future will certainly keep money safe &#8211; and do its best to make it grow. But it will also understand that really its job is to open up pathways to contentment around money and that this depends on far more than a 4.5% annual increase in portfolios. It will therefore seek to act as a forum in which customers can learn what role money plays in their lives and what their options might really be. The idea of a bank stands ready to be re-invented, no longer as an institution that just has a secure safe-deposit box and a commitment to fruitful investment, but also one that tackles the underlying issues which banking straddles, the profound questions of how we can live well around money, however much or little we may have. The ambitious banks of the future will be experts in finance, of course, but they will also know a lot about something equally critical but as yet too often ignored by the financial world: the psychology of money.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are, apparently, in a golden age of the communications industry. This is a sector that has grown in double digits for over 20 years. Almost the entire world is now wired and connected; we can stand on a remote clifftop and effortlessly send our thoughts to distant continents via devices smaller than a pack of cards.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Phones equipped with the capacities of yesterday’s supercomputers &#8211; yet able to fit into our pockets &#8211;  show miraculous improvements on a six monthly basis.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2923225445_7b265a69b0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9340" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2923225445_7b265a69b0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2923225445_7b265a69b0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Communications companies can rightly point out, as they often do in their advertisements, that they have helped us to communicate better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are two ways to understand what communication actually is:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- defined technically, good communication means the capacity to effectively and near instantaneously relay data or voice signals from one person to another</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- psychologically, good communication means the ability to make oneself heard and understood by others about the things that really matter, especially the tricky, awkward things</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9345" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="7428993092_82c1b2ea1d_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure good technical communication, you need the best routers, servers, fibre optic cables, wifis and satellites.</span></p>
<p>And to be a good communicator at a psychological level, you need to be equipped with the very best kind of emotional education:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an ability to understand what you yourself think and feel</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a confidence that you will be able to make yourself heard by others</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a capacity to be patient and non-aggressive in relaying messages</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a skill at evading the defence mechanisms of your listener</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- an open-mindedness in hearing ideas that could sound foreign or threatening</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and finally, a culture that lends legitimacy to the idea of people talking frankly to one another about the most vital things.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6029951734_f8ceba1124_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9349" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6029951734_f8ceba1124_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Phone Call on a Balcony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite our extraordinary prowess at the technical side of communication, we humans have &#8211; arguably &#8211; made very little progress towards improving the quality of psychological communication between ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We still too often get into sulks and furies, we don’t say what is on our minds or fail to get our points across. Despite all the masts and satellites, there are still too many sons not quite saying what they feel to their mothers and wives not listening to their husbands and colleagues not finding the right words. There are still too many suicide notes and death-bed scenes where the majority is left unsaid.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4556917408_e39510967c_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9351" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4556917408_e39510967c_b.jpg?resize=550%2C645" alt="4556917408_e39510967c_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>So much of what we want to say remains locked up inside us, or travels between humans as unreliably as the pigeon post of 200 years ago.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is time for us to reach a broader understanding of what a Communication Company really could be: not just an organisation that ensures that people communicate technically, but also one that helps to facilitate a good psychological dialogue between them; a company that helps give them the emotional equipment to ensure that the important conversations can happen. </span></p>
<p>We can feel deeply grateful to the folks who brought us our phones; we’ll feel even more grateful to the companies of the future that will properly honour the highest ideals of human communication.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3722" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefA.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="Dawn Viens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Californian chef David Viens and his wife Dawn were having problems in their marriage. He became controlling; whenever Dawn went out he wanted to know exactly where she had been. Dawn started putting money aside, to get out of the relationship. David found out. Thousands of couples go through rough patches all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then Dawn disappeared. The police looked everywhere, they tore up walls and floors of his restaurant, Thyme Contemporary Cafe, in the small town of Lomita, California. But they never found her. David eventually explained: he had boiled her body for four days. Only a bit of the skull was left.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is horrific but, strangely, reassuring. They look so normal. He reminds you of a cheeky boy in the classroom when you were a kid. She’s like someone you just saw at the supermarket. The photos could easily turn up in a story about a couple who have an amazing collection of tropical fish. Or a feature on a successful husband and wife rally driving duo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We mostly encounter the edited versions of other people. While we are continually exposed to the unedited version of ourselves. The unfair comparison means we inevitably feel much weirder than we really are. There’s that strange sexual thing that excites you. You feel like crying when you get stuck in traffic. In groups you have the strange sense that everyone is normal except you. At work you feel the need to laugh at a remark which, in all honesty, strikes you as entirely unamusing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3723" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-030214-chefB.jpg?resize=635%2C435" alt="PM-030214-chefB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Happier days</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is where David comes in. He has redrawn the scale of strangeness. By being exposed as fifty times more strange, he repositions our own lonely peculiarities squarely back in the realm of the humdrum and average. It has absolutely never even crossed your mind to cook your partner. Not once have you eyed a cauldron with murder on your mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is surely one of the hidden reasons middle-aged men turn in such numbers to reading books about Adolf Hitler. His catastrophic levels of insane rage, delusion, destructiveness and cruelty make pretty much everyone else look lovely by comparison. One may have spent the evening drinking beer, made three vaguely insulting remarks and omitted to brush one’s teeth before coming to bed. But by the standards of Berchtesgaden your are revealed as really rather nice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not pretending there isn’t a hideous side to what David did. But the focus here is on how an appalling event plays out in the privacy of people’s heads. And despite all the tragedy involved, it may be doing us some good.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The competition among resort hotels is fierce and, in order to secure our loyalty, establishments have to show us that they are trying hard in a range of areas. They therefore strive to demonstrate that they will:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- do everything to make sure we will sleep well</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- help us reconnect with our families</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- provide a forum in which we can rekindle romantic feelings</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- give us a sense of well-being</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9501" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="12674342615_bfeaa7a664_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>It is worth paying close attention to how our hotels go about achieving these four properly important aims &#8211; because of the light it casts on our societies in general; this is about a lot more than just hotels. We live in highly material times. This is often understood to mean that we love money as opposed to ‘higher things’; that we are, in other words, materialistic. But such a definition threatens to throw the emphasis on greed, whereas the real issue is broader and more intriguing. It is rather the case that we overwhelmingly treat human beings as creatures whose only pleasures &#8211; and sorrows &#8211; are those that occur in the body. The lion’s share of the economy is devoted to satisfying physical, as opposed to psychological needs. We see this issue in its most acute form in the arena of modern medicine, which &#8211; with its dazzling technologies &#8211; insists on seeing the human animal as a machine made up of interconnected organs and pays scant attention to what used to be called the soul.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An identical approach is present, in a more covert form, in the realm of hotels. Here too the idea of pleasure is interpreted solely as if it were a bodily experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious hotels of today implicitly ask themselves a variety of questions about happiness and answer them in ways we should find distinctive:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why can&#8217;t people sleep?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the bed is not springy enough, the quilt is not made with duck feathers and the cotton in the sheets is not from the Nile Delta.</span></em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why do families disconnect emotionally?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there is no water slide, no pool with a wave machine and no waterskiing instructor.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why has romance died?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Because there is no restaurant overlooking the bay and no French cuisine with a northern Italian twist.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Why are people not feeling well?</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because their feet have not been rubbed sufficiently thoroughly and no one has yet poured jasmine oil on their backs.</span></em></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8717591430_fee1cd577a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9507" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8717591430_fee1cd577a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8717591430_fee1cd577a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern resort hotel is a machine for happiness that overwhelmingly insists that the roots of unhappiness reside at the physical level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some undoubtedly do (one should not quibble with the pleasures of a water slide) but a great many of the more stubborn obstacles to contentment appear to be firmly rooted in our minds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a competitive marketplace, an important future resides with hotels that can remember just how many difficulties exist outside of our bodies. These ingenious establishments will, alongside the fine restaurants and sheets, also have the imagination to provide hospitality and care for our turbulent and skittish minds.</span></p>
