				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Missions are things we tend to associate with astronauts.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8493566614_d898db0521_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9071" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8493566614_d898db0521_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8493566614_d898db0521_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone at a party asked you what you did, and you said you were involved on a mission of some kind, people would look at you sort of strangely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in truth, we’d all benefit from focusing in on the purpose of our lives so that we can refer to them as missions of one kind or another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the entrepreneur Elon Musk was at university, he asked himself very explicitly what his mission in life would be. He began by wondering what the world needed most urgently, then he looked into himself to see what his talents were and that led him to a list of four possible missions: space exploration, electric transportation, Artificial Intelligence and rewriting the human genome. In the end, Elon Musk chose the first two.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9075" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o.png?resize=500%2C658" alt="4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us will ever settle on missions as mighty as these, but the notion of having a mission, rather than a mere job or hobby, remains widely applicable. How, then, can we learn to adopt the mission mindset?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Firstly, what matters is to adopt a certain seriousness about one’s life. The working bit will only be, at best, 50 years. So the challenge is around focus: how can one reduce the range of one’s enthusiasms and see that having so many interests is half the problem. Talk of a mission forces us to reduce what we care about down to just a few very big things: it privileges precision over breadth. You give yourself a specific target, aware of how much energy it will take to reach it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Secondly, a mission is about having a plan; and reducing the amount of times that, because one has no clear goal, one gets swept along by the plans of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Then again, a mission is different from an ambition. An ambition starts with what you want. A mission centers around what others need. People with missions may well end up making money and having status, but that isn’t what led them to the mission in the first place. Missions are about the intrinsic worth of tasks.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15371194197_10e119fb37_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9084" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15371194197_10e119fb37_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15371194197_10e119fb37_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The search for a mission requires you to ask: among all the problems facing humanity, what are the ones that properly interest me? Be alive to the small-scale but authentic concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Having focused on a problem of humanity that feels right for you, you then need to take an honest look at your own aptitutes. What truly are your talents? What can you contribute? That may require a lot of introspection, career counselling and experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Then, where your skills and aptitudes intersect with the needs of the world, that is your distinctive zone: that’s where your mission lies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A mission isn’t a mission because it is grand, but because it is precise. Examples of modest but crucial missions might be:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a mission to improve the care that the elderly receive at the end of their lives</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or a mission to teach children music in an engaging way</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3696190320_6b8c13052c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9083" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3696190320_6b8c13052c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3696190320_6b8c13052c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or a mission to get the best pizzas out to the customers of north Liverpool or downtown San Diego.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Conceiving of a mission requires us to throw off an attitude of inner serfdom, where we imagine that only other people have the right to plan their lives &#8211; and everyone else must just surrender to accidents and random whims of employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We can and should all have missions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a mission in hand, the next time you’re at a party, you won’t need to keep the conversation at the level of where you’re employed, you can answer with reference to the underlying logic of what you are up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can, with no space helmet to your name, legitimately announce that you’re in this earth with a mission to carry out.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Understanding how to serve customers well is a major factor in the success of corporations: and service has a big role outside work too. It’s one of the many ways in which there’s an overlap between getting better in business and getting better at life in general. Service means helping others to thrive. It’s a goal that’s been around longer than humanity.</p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Macaca_fuscata_grooming_Iwatayama_20090201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7428" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Macaca_fuscata_grooming_Iwatayama_20090201.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="640px-Macaca_fuscata,_grooming,_Iwatayama,_20090201" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A service culture exists amongst Japanese Snow Monkeys</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re all keen on being served well. But getting good at serving is tricky. It’s a problem that deserves a great deal of sympathy. We’re one of the first generations in history to be grappling with the delivery of effective service on a mass scale. There are so many ways service can go wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The fear that it’s humiliating to serve</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For centuries, the idea of service was focused on one particular kind of job: being a servant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/040-downton-abbey-theredlist.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7429" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/040-downton-abbey-theredlist.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="040-downton-abbey-theredlist" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It didn’t necessarily seem like a terrible option at the time. There was little social mobility; if your parents were servants you were probably going to end up doing the same thing. Carrying a tray or polishing shoes might not seem at all bad compared to hewing coal or digging the fields. But there must have been untold millions of moments of petty humiliation, many of them around unpleasant bosses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then across the Western World this kind of employment largely disappeared, under the combined impacts of WWI and WWII. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3165261-10997_0x420.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7431" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3165261-10997_0x420.jpg?resize=635%2C467" alt="3165261-10997_0x420" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Mary Quant, 1965</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And by the 1960s &#8211; in the New York of <em>Mad Men</em> or the London of Mary Quant -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>being a servant came to sound like a dreary, slightly shameful kind of work. Service wasn’t sexy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been offered the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964 and had very publicly rejected it, were getting a wider hearing. In his</span><em> Being and Nothingness </em>(1943), we find a strangely annoying waiter as the focus of Sartre’s account of what he felt was wrong with society in general: to serve is to be inauthentic, to fail to be who you really are.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/url.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7432" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/url.jpg?resize=440%2C352" alt="url" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Let us consider this waiter in the cafe. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He comes toward the patrons with a step a little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer.’ (<em>Being and Nothingness</em>, Part I Chapter 2 &#8211; &#8216;Bad Faith&#8217;) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all these reasons, the image of the grovelling, defeated &#8211; and resentful &#8211; servant (or waiter) infected the whole idea of service. The successful person is served, the less successful does the serving. This attitude lingers. The background belief that serving is humiliating leads to problems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The low esteem in which service can be held leads some ambitious people to steer clear of obvious ‘service’ roles. It’s easy to under-rate the potential economic contribution of good service to the company. So it gets under-rewarded, which maintains the circle of low-esteem. Companies think they care about service; they certainly don’t want to offer bad service. But because we don’t have a clear image of what great service really means, we don’t see the potential that’s being missed. We don’t realise how much mediocre service is costing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10651314316_036de46c9d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7434" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10651314316_036de46c9d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="10651314316_036de46c9d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this can lead to veiled aggressive behaviour on the part of the one serving, for example, when the air steward brusquely tells you to put your seat upright (though it must actually have been a previous passenger who left it very slightly reclined because you didn’t touch it). In his or her head, the steward might think:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have to serve you, but don’t think I like you; I’m only doing it for the money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I had any other option, I wouldn’t be doing this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve got to smile &#8211; but inside I’m seething… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve got to pretend you’re right (but I think you’re an idiot).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer picks up on the attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We’re incredibly sensitive to the difference between a real smile (which we love) and a fake one (which puts us one edge, make us suspicious). The negative attitude around the status of serving seems natural to us. But actually it’s a product of culture. That is: it depends on the images and associations that happen to be familiar to us. Which means it would be relatively straightforward to do a crucial thing: to get a more accurate understanding of the dignity of service and then to increase its prestige. It just means regularly reminding ourselves of some very positive ideas about service. To get this started, we can look back to some high points in the history of service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Jesus was keen on service</em>:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity tapped into the big idea that service is noble, and not humiliating at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/El_Lavatorio_Tintoretto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7435" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/El_Lavatorio_Tintoretto.jpg?resize=635%2C247" alt="El_Lavatorio_(Tintoretto)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle of the 16th century, the Italian artist Tintoretto painted several pictures of a scene from the life of Jesus. Just before they sit down to have the last supper, Jesus gets on his hands and knees and acts as the servant of his disciples, carefully washing and wiping their dusty feet. The point of the story was to say: here’s why this man was so great. He wanted to help people, he saw service as one of the greatest things we can do. And Tintoretto adds to the message by painting a very grand picture of this act of service. In effect, the artist is saying: let me show you this magnificent scene, this heroic act. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The greatest Roman Emperor, Trajan, saw himself as a servant </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trajan (53-117 AD) ushered in the </span>golden age of the Roman Empire, when good government was combined with prosperity and security. His descendants were great leaders who revered his example, culminating in the rule of his great-great nephew, Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the characteristic stories about Trajan told how when he was riding to review his troops, he was accosted in the street by a desperate mother whose son had been killed, seeking his help. Trajan was incredibly busy, she was no one very important. The Emperor took the opportunity to put one of his core convictions into practice. He stopped, got off his horse and addressed her case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan_oil_on_canvas_1858.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7436" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan_oil_on_canvas_1858.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan,_oil_on_canvas,_1858" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wanted to demonstrate to his followers that helping her wasn’t beneath his dignity: it’s what his position was really all about: the point of all the power and authority is to bring justice to the people: to serve them well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The painter Eugène Delacroix was obsessed by this moment. He’s summoning up all the grandeur of the emperor &#8211; the banners, the trumpets, the rearing war horse &#8211; and focusing not on conquering the enemy or setting out on a great voyage of exploration but on a routine and deeply honourable act of good service. He’s using art to show what we usually can’t see: the true value of quiet acts of kindness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Luther and the serving maid</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1520, Martin Luther (1483-1546) published the second of his three major treatises, <em>On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church</em>. It was an extension of his re-reading of Christianity and embodied his nascent Protestant ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7441" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg?resize=635%2C488" alt="Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the work, Luther radically claimed that one can serve God in a variety of ways, not just by entering the Priesthood: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;Hence I advise no man, yea, I dissuade every man from entering into the priesthood or any religious order, unless he be so fortified with knowledge as to understand that, however sacred and lofty may be the works of priests or of the religious orders, they differ not at all in the sight of God from the works of a husbandman labouring in his field, or of a woman attending to her household affairs, but that in His eyes all things are measured by faith alone . . . Nay, it very often happens that the common work of a servant or a handmaiden is more acceptable to God than all the fastings and works of a monk or a priest, when they are done without faith.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luther’s big idea was that Christians could serve God by carrying out essential work, such as looking after the family, labouring and farming. Famously, Luther writes that ‘God is milking the cows through the vocation of the milkmaid.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This meant that every legitimate piece of work was a ‘calling’ from God; a ‘vocation’. God has endowed each and every one of us with talents that can be used to help one another out. These talents manifest themselves in work: a skilled baker can literally give ‘us our daily bread’, soldiers can ‘deliver us from evil’ and nurses and doctors can heal the sick. In total, then, God looks after humanity through workers. Everyone undertaking these essential tasks is wearing what Luther calls the ‘mask of God’, since God is behind each task. Luther says God wants us to serve one another through work as a means of serving him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/at-the-linen-closet-16631.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7442" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/at-the-linen-closet-16631.jpg?resize=635%2C589" alt="at-the-linen-closet-1663(1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luther was making a huge point. To do a small service whole-heartedly and well is actually to do a great thing &#8211; though its greatness is spiritual rather than material and so is easily missed. It’s not at all necessary to share Luther’s religious convictions to be impressed by his line of thought. There’s a big psychological benefit to doing a simple task cheerfully and neatly &#8211; even if it’s only loading the dishwasher so every item is in the right place or tidying the linen cupboard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Napoleon, the night before the Battle of Austerlitz </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The night before his greatest victory &#8211; the Battle of Austerlitz &#8211; Napoleon went round the tents of his troops, making sure they’d had their rations and that they were settling down quietly. It was a task that was hardly required by the supreme Commander. A minor adjutant would have been fine. But Napoleon was sending a message about the nobility of serving. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their different ways, these heroes of service are all counteracting the notion that service is what the weak do for the strong. Instead, they are seeing service as something that everyone should be involved in. It’s part of the well-lived life. It’s a noble thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7443" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An unexpected ally in this campaign is Andy Warhol. He entirely agreed that glamour is the key to raising the prestige of service: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;They should have a college course now for maids and call it something glamorous. People don&#8217;t want to work at something unless there&#8217;s a glamorous name tagged to it&#8230; Even very intelligent people could get a lot out of being maids because they&#8217;d see so many interesting people and be working in the most beautiful houses. I mean, everybody does something for everybody else, and if it weren&#8217;t for the stigma we give certain jobs, the exchange would always be equal. A mother is always doing things for her child, so what&#8217;s wrong with a person off the street doing something for you?&#8230;I&#8217;ve always thought that the President could do so much here to help change images. If the President would go into a public bathroom in the Capitol, and have the TV cameras film him cleaning the toilets and saying &#8216;why not?&#8230; The President has so much good publicity potential that hasn&#8217;t been exploited. He should just sit down one day and make a list of all the things that people are embarrassed to do that they shouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed to do, and then do them all on television.&#8217; (</span><em>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</em>)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He thought that the airline industry could spearhead the revolution in the perception of service: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1970s.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7444" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1970s.jpg?resize=445%2C600" alt="1970s" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;Airline stewardesses have the best public image. Their work is actually what the waitresses at Bickford&#8217;s do, plus a few additional duties. I don&#8217;t want to put down the airline stewardesses. I just want to put up the Bickford ladies. The difference is that airline stewardessing is a new world job that never had to contend with any class stigmas left over from the old world peasant-aristocracy syndrome.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s amazing what glamour can do to raise the prestige of a service job. Prostitution is not, generally, a high-status job. But, in Japan, poets and artist worked to endow sexual services with glamour. They invented the idea of the geisha. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7445" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What distinguishes the geisha is the range and quality of the service provided: it’s sexual, but also intellectual and aesthetic. Under this improved description, and supported by intelligent advocacy, a form of prostitution became widely admired &#8211; and deeply respectable. The Japanese understood the mechanism for making this transformation in status: beautiful art works and elegant poems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal future, the perception we have of service could be very different from what it is today. We can imagine a world in which being someone&#8217;s personal servant or the nanny to their children could be a deeply prestigious, highly coveted job. Instead of dreaming of working for Goldman Sachs, the most ambitious college graduates would be anxiously working out how to position themselves as a potential valet or family tutor. It wouldn’t be fake prestige: it would be founded on an accurate vision of the worth of the service provided. Bringing up children well is one of the central tasks of a life. The people who do it well (the best nannies, teachers and tutors) should be glamorous &#8211; and correspondingly well paid. The ideal personal helper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>is managing, correcting and refining their employer’s self-conception. They are making life more effective and meaningful. These are huge contributions and the rightful target of ambition. In the Utopia, service would have the high prestige it deserves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The belief that the customer is awful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sadly, it&#8217;s not always hard to come to this conclusion. They often seem to be asking you to hate them. The irritation of the server with the served is entirely understandable. But, it is also potentially disastrous &#8211; obviously. The server’s mask slips, a little of their contempt comes through. The manager is dragged in. The customer, whose self-regard has been injured &#8211; talks viciously about the company to all their friends. Next time you look there’s a 27-reasons-I-hate-your-business page on Facebook swelling its numbers.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To address this, it’s necessary to engage with one of the biggest (and most productive) questions we can ask: <em>why do other people behave in ways that aren’t very nice? </em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three big answers: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Firstly: In the past, the other person suffered in ways that have left scars. What you see as annoying patterns of behaviour originated long ago as strategies for coping with very frightening situations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If they are snobbish or pompous &#8211; it’s probably because at a formative point they faced grim humiliations. They had to emphasise and grasp after status wherever they could because they felt its lack so desperately. The outer circumstances may have moved on for this individual, but their psychological habits are still desperately fighting the old battles. At the back of their minds they are still warding off a terrible humiliation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If they get furious over a trivial thing, it’s probably because in the past they really were exposed to a lot of aggression. They coped by bearing their teeth and shouting and making themselves look dangerous &#8211; aggression is a very natural defence mechanism. Because the instincts are such slow learners, they end up shouting at you, though the person they are really trying to scare may have passed away five years ago, or be living these days in a small farmhouse in the Massif Central.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6614968881_5cf95a5b60_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7463" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6614968881_5cf95a5b60_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="6614968881_5cf95a5b60_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Raul Lieberwirth</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer is scared, not mean or bad &#8211; though, unfortunately, at first sight, they look mean and bad and not at all scared. If they revealed their distress more obviously &#8211; if they wept or looked terrified &#8211; we’d behave gently. Yet it really is the same distress, only presented in a misleading and deeply unfortunate disguise. And they are in need of the same gentleness and forbearance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secondly: There’s a big problem on their mind. They haven’t told you about it, of course. But there was a very difficult meeting at work earlier in the day. Or they are going through a brutal divorce. Or their dog had to be put down yesterday &#8211; their beloved companion for 14 memorable years. Or the Moroccan economy &#8211; where they have major holdings &#8211; is in crisis. They are distressed about something you can’t be aware of. And it leads them to behave in unpleasant ways. It feels as if it is about you, but it isn’t. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key moves in psychoanalysis is to look at the trouble children have understanding how a difficult mood of a parent isn&#8217;t about them. The powerful, natural tendency for the child is to suppose otherwise, to think that, if dad is upset, it’s my fault, when the real cause is he’s trying to shed some weight and not having a second helping of lasagna drives him nuts; or he’s been playing badly at tennis for the last two weeks and it’s getting him down: he feels he’s past it; or he’s having an affair and feels terribly guilty. It’s incredibly hard for the child to understand things when the mood isn’t about them and yet it is happening around them. They have so few explanatory resources to bring to the situations &#8211; how could they possibly know what drives the adult psyche? As we grow older, we get marginally better at realising that what’s going on for other people often isn&#8217;t about us, even when we’re the nearest object in the environment. But the idea remains fragile in our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2837490957_7262c82267_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7449" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2837490957_7262c82267_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2837490957_7262c82267_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regular reminders of the concept that there are off-stage causes to others’ moods is a huge help in navigating our way through life. Learning not to take it personally isn’t a last counsel of despair. It’s usually a deeply accurate assessment of what is really going one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thirdly: The other person is actually quite nice… in parts of their life you don’t get to see. The customer isn’t revealing the whole of their life. It’s natural &#8211; but mistaken &#8211; for us to assume that a person is entirely as we happen to see them being. The muddled shopper must be, we suppose, befuddled about everything all the time. It’s hard for us to believe that the woman who absolutely can’t decide whether she wants steak tartare or lobster &#8211; is assured and decisive when it comes to drafting reports on the opportunities and risks for pharmaceutical companies in the Mexican market. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider this picture by the 19th-century French artist Ingres. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7450" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817.jpg?resize=635%2C506" alt="henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a history picture of the French King Henry the Fourth &#8211; who reigned a couple of centuries earlier. Here, Henry’s giving a horse ride to his children and having the time of his life cavorting on the carpet. But this wasn’t at all how he usually came across. His people generally saw him as severe and a bit brutish. He ruled, people said, ‘with a sword in his hand and his arse on the saddle of a warhorse’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of people have Henry IV-like unexpected sides to their character, which tell you a lot about who they really are. The fussy customer works two nights a week for the Samaritans listening to people’s most terrible moments of distress. The guy with the ridiculously loud laugh and the crushingly boring stories runs the best shoe repair shop in Exeter: unrivalled in that city for quality, speed and fair prices. The fickle woman with the posh voice is deeply loyal to her transexual brother and was his main support all through his transition. If you knew these sides it would change your view of who they are. But we just don’t get to see them in service situations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good service draws on sympathy. Instead of getting offended by the annoying behaviour of those we serve, we’d be more patient and forgiving. Not because we’re soft-hearted or can’t stand up for ourselves. But because we’d have a clearer idea of what is really going on: I’m not encountering a dreadful person. Just an ordinary person labouring under a fear, a current problem or who isn’t quite at their best round here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal service company, therefore, wouldn’t be preaching to its employees to smile a lot and rehearse saying ‘of course, madam’ in the bathroom mirror. It would be more focused on presenting its workers with helpful theories of human nature. It would improve service &#8211; in tricky situations &#8211; and manage staff morale by continually reminding its workforce of some powerful truths about how decent people can come across badly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: The failure to recognise customer anxiety</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong when it fails to understand that interacting with a given business is likely to have generated a cluster of anxious feelings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16824280347_9d9b71a419_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7454" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16824280347_9d9b71a419_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16824280347_9d9b71a419_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/anton petukhov</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a little remarked-upon fact, but every service situation is associated with a degree of anxiety in the customer: the task of a good business is to understand the dynamics of anxiety on top of which it will inevitably sit &#8211; and then to take steps to correct and attenuate these. We have an image of a customer utterly confident in their needs and in themselves, just keen to extract great service and move on. But the portrait needs to be redrawn. We come at service situations with a range of worries. Providing good service means asking yourself an unusual question: ‘What are the anxieties that cluster around my area of service &#8211; and how can I best deal with them…?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might name a new way of serving:<strong> Anxiety-focused service</strong>. It has two components. The first is the sympathetic, imaginative exploration of the worries that customers might have. Not by asking them &#8211; because they won’t, or often can’t, tell you what’s really bugging them. Either it’s something they find embarrassing to talk about or it’s very hard to pinpoint. Instead, imagine you are a novelist and you’ve got a very nice character who happens to be anxious around this area of service. What would be going on for them? (In an ideal world, this form of imaginative exercise would be a main source of employment for novelists &#8211; which would in turn deeply help business and the bank balances of authors). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second is working out how to zap the problem. How can you meet the anxiety and offer reassurance or help? Each industry will have different anxieties to contend with, you need to know your industry-specific anxiety and put in place measures to deal with them. To get this field of business started, we offer some case studies: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I: A customer walks into a jewellery store selling engagement rings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How is he anxious? He knows nothing about carats, he is scared of being thought cheap but also of spending too much. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zapping the fear: One might have a jewellery store that advertises saying: &#8216;a ring is nice, but kindness is nicer. We’ll make sure you don’t blow your savings on a symbol.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And: &#8216;it would be weird if you knew a lot about diamonds; you’ve had everything else to think about.&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">II: Someone stays at a smart hotel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many problems, but here are three: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– your partner has kicked you out of the room (and quite rightly too)</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be daunting &#8211; especially for men &#8211; to walk into a clothes shop with the idea of purchasing a pair of trousers. In a minute you’ll be telling a stranger about whether a piece of cloth is too tight in the groin area; you’ll be in your underpants shielded only by a thin beige curtain that won’t close properly; they might start measuring your inside leg. Some people don’t mind. But many do. They’ll spend years with a slightly wrong pair of trousers because (though they’re courageous in other areas) they couldn’t face properly talking to the salesperson about the fit.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Introversion and gregarious service</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal of good service has unfortunately been connected with the notion of being gregarious. We have a picture of the ideal person in service: chatty, cheerful and perhaps a little loud. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should recognise that this manner is only found attractive and enticing by a share of the population. For many, an excessively chatty, upbeat manner is alarming rather than reassuring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service works with a mental picture (which won’t usually be very explicit) of what the customer is like: what kind of person are they? What will make them feel comfortable or ill at ease?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The term ‘introversion’ is a relatively recent &#8211; and very helpful &#8211; invention. It became mainstream through its use in the Myers-Briggs personality Type Indicator, which was introduced in the 1940s and later widely adopted in business. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sums up and labels a very common characteristic: being preoccupied with one’s own thoughts and feelings, the desire to be given a lot of personal space, a tendency to feel overwhelmed by the attentions of other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it does something else: the term &#8211; and the tests &#8211; reveal that this is a very normal characteristic. About 50% of customers will be like this &#8211; at least to some extent. And about 25% will be markedly like this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Introversion’ isn’t the name of a problem. It’s a name of a normal way of being. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a challenge because people who work in front-line service situations are not likely to be particularly introverted themselves. (This is a consequence of our natural &#8211; but misguided &#8211; assumption that to be good at service and selling you should ideally be very outgoing.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s opportunity for a lot more introvert-sensitive service. It’s possible to expand into this underdeveloped market &#8211; a market defined not by geography or income, but by psychology. And it’s not exploitation, because often the shy or introverted person would actually very much like to buy certain products, but they are hampered from doing so because of the prevalent technique of gregarious service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Training in introvert-sensitive service would be inspired by the work of the English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/winnicott-from-bellespics-eu1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7526" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/winnicott-from-bellespics-eu1.jpg?resize=275%2C275" alt="winnicott-from-bellespics-eu" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Winnicott’s tips on service, part I </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He talks very strictly against parents who always want to ‘jolly’ a baby along, rather than let it have its own moods. It’s a bit disconcerting at first &#8211; what could be wrong with keeping a child jolly? His point is that it’s the implied idea that it’s terrible to be a bit low, or upset, or quiet, or absorbed &#8211; in any way not overtly cheery &#8211; that does the damage. These low-key states aren’t a problem. It’s OK to feel sad because some things, like a broken toy, the death of a goldfish or being lonely on Sunday afternoon, are a bit sad. So, it&#8217;s fine for a customer to be pensive, solemn or quiet. They don’t need their mood lifted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Winnicott&#8217;s tips on service, part II</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott was sensitive to the (unintended) ways hyped-up expectations can get us down. Because we’re uncomfortably aware that we won’t live up to them. Winnicott specialised in problems in families and in his work he encountered many patients who were deeply disappointed with themselves for ‘not being a good mother’ or feeling ‘I’m nothing like the great dad I’m supposed to be’. But he could see that &#8211; imperfect as they certainly were, they were pretty good parents. They meant well, they tried, they made mistakes but they did their best in the circumstances, and he came to the conclusion that this was &#8211; really &#8211; what children needed to encounter. What one really needs, growing up, is not an ideally flawless parent, but a model of how to be a decent, OK, but inevitably flawed individual. What the child needs, Winnicott said, is a ‘good enough’ parent.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of referring to an ideal, one should help people feel OK about the ‘good enough.’ It’s a move that can be applied widely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Rather than tout a product as ‘a great deal,&#8217; they could call it ‘a not too bad offer’; the suit you try on might be praised as ‘pretty much OK.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– From: &#8216;there&#8217;s a fantastic range of socks&#8217; to ‘we’ve got some moderately decent socks over here.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– From: ‘you’ll love this’ to ‘this might just be acceptable.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Instead of saying ‘have a great day’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- to someone who will (probably) have a disappointing meeting a work, a frustrating commute, a tense disagreement with their partner and have to pay their road-tax bill &#8211; one could more usefully wish them a ‘good enough’ day -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a day that will be far from great in all respects. To the more thoughtful person (more introverted, more shy) it will sound genuinely friendly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Over-commitment to ‘the rules’ </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the more dramatic failures of service occurs when an employee sticks strictly to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>‘the rules’, apparently on behalf of the business, but in a way that is maddening to the customer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a car-hire desk, the specific car that’s been booked in the system has turned up late and is still being cleaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But a similar car is free. Yet the employee will tell the customer (desperate to get on their way to a meeting in Slough) that they have to wait forty minutes for the cleaning and checking of the vehicle. All the while, the customer can see the other vehicle sitting there out the window. ‘The rule is, if the car is back, the customer gets the assigned car; it is still on the M4. I could give you the other one.’ The person at the desk knows there’s nothing the customer can do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5546326877_816c553ee8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7469" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5546326877_816c553ee8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="5546326877_816c553ee8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A passenger with a business class ticket doesn’t have a special express lane card for security screening. (They started their journey, and had all their boarding passes issued at a provincial airport where they don’t have such things.) The attendant has seen a million BA business passengers, but &#8211; since there is no voucher &#8211; sternly points in the direction of a huge queue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A mother decides to pay her lackadaisical son’s electricity bill on a small student apartment before the supply is cut off (while the boy is hiking across the Andes and out of satellite range for two weeks). She finds the call centre employee demanding the account password, which &#8211; of course &#8211; she doesn&#8217;t have, because ‘information about the account is private’ &#8211; although the malicious paying of other people’s electricity bills is not a recognised crime category. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer’s situation is clear. The employee knows they should be given the car that’s free now, let into the express lane or be allowed to pay the bill. But the employees are technically in the right. And they are safe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- the customer can’t do anything about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, this kind of behaviour is a problem for the company. Offending customers isn’t part of the corporate strategy. But in order to address it effectively it’s useful to start in an unexpected &#8211; but always important &#8211; way: with sympathy. We should admit that if you are feeling a bit pissed off with the world, it’s very tempting to cause others a bit of pain and hide behind the rules &#8211; especially if the people you are hurting seem to have a nicer life than you. It’s not nice, but it’s not strange. If we’re honest, we can probably all admit to moments when we’re hurting and we feel: why the hell should I help you?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might happen in a domestic setting. Your partner agreed to go out to see a film on Thursday night. But they had a tough day at work, and they’re not in the mood and at the last minute they say they’d rather stay in. You’re annoyed and you milk the situation: ‘you promised &#8211; so are you saying now that when you promise something, it doesn’t mean anything? You could have said ‘maybe’ you’d go out; but no, you said you definitely would &#8211; and now you’re going right back on your word.’ You’re technically in the right. Usually, if we’re being mean, we’re clearly in the wrong. It can be hard to resist the slightly sinister (but not uncommon) satisfaction of being simultaneously right and mean. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So too with the employee: the customer is squirming, &#8216;well &#8211; fuck them, I’m technically in the right.&#8217; We need to acknowledge that the position of ‘serving’ can be very problematic for some of us. We use the small power we have to cause inconvenience for people we feel resentment towards. We can afford to admit the desire to stop a superior, to get a little safe revenge for the the multiple disappointments of existence. The rule has given us the permission not to be very nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One way the ideal company would address this service problem would be to be open about the temptation. Admitting the allure of this kind of situation doesn’t mean approving of it. In fact, acknowledging it is the key to keeping it in check. Being open about the desire sometimes to be mean to others, allows us to look at where the desire has come from. How does one arrive at this position? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes someone use ‘the rules’ in a mean way? We can go, sympathetically, behind the scenes of their life. The desire to hurt others is rooted in having been hurt too much oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16176068743_149f4c1c38_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7471" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16176068743_149f4c1c38_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16176068743_149f4c1c38_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Once, at a formative moment, they were humiliated and punished for doing something wrong. Then they saw someone else doing the same thing and ‘getting away with it’; it felt so unfair. Never again, if they could help it. If the rules are going to be imposed strictly on them they’re going to make sure the same applies to everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– They are trying to impose (in an admittedly ineffective way) order on a universe that feels chaotic. The news is filled with mayhem and greed, they can’t control their children, their partner, the erratic bus service… But here, at least, they can stick to a clear, precise arrangement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Too often they’ve been made to feel that a ‘superior’ person was looking down on them. These were very wounding experiences. They are on the look out for revenge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These aren’t very lovely things. But they call for sympathy &#8211; that is, the recognition that one has similar kinds of strands in one’s own experience. It’s understandable people end up being sticklers for the rules. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sympathetic understanding has a transformative effect. It doesn’t blame the individual for having had these experiences. But it reveals the way their current behaviour doesn&#8217;t really help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It was horrible to see someone getting away with something you were punished for. But it wasn’t the customer who got away with it (It was Jacqueline McFarlane of flat 5, 137 Acacia Avenue, West Solihull).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Sticking to the rules won’t actually compensate for the messy cupboard under the stairs.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It wasn’t this customer who laughed at your shoes (it was a brattish guy who now has a young daughter with a speech impediment).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you admit you’re taking out your own troubles on another person, you can get more alive to the fact that this isn’t the person who hurt you. They’re just the nearest available target. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company can also be up front about the danger. They can say: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve put in place a lot of rules and procedures which are designed to make things easier for everyone. The rules will give you some power over people at tricky moments in their lives. And we understand that sometimes you’ll feel tempted to abuse them in this way. But please don’t. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want you to be flexible. The most important thing is to help the customer. If that means leaving a box unticked or changing slightly the way something is done, that’s fine. The standard procedure isn’t set in stone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key thing the astute service provider is doing here is recognising how tempting it can be for an employee to offer bad service. To get great at providing service, the company needs to work with an accurate view of, and constructive sympathy for, the crooked timbers of human nature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: People haven’t served you enough</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not a cause of bad service that leaps to mind; but a standard reason service goes wrong is that the server hasn&#8217;t themselves had enough experience of being treated well. There hasn&#8217;t been enough good service coming in their direction.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An employee has been gradually getting more and more brittle around customers. In the canteen they get into the habit of mouthing off about the dreadful characters they have to deal with. Then they snap. A customer complains that the olives are green, not black; a guest harangues them because the bells are ringing for a wedding in a nearby church; someone gets annoyed because of the unusually high credit card surcharge (as if the sales assistant had themselves instituted this arrangement). The employee snaps. They shout. Or they rush off weeping. They calm down later, but they are dreadfully ashamed. They feel they’ve become a grumpy, short-fused person. They blame themselves for letting it get to them. They feel, frankly, a bit shitty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The employee who suddenly loses it is a problem for the business &#8211; and is a problem for the employee themselves. But addressing this issue means understanding it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should start by seeing that service requires us to step outside of the needs of our own ego for a while. We have to stop thinking about what we want, and think about what someone else wants. In short, service requires us to be generous. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the ability to be generous is not a fixed, stable feature of anyone’s character. When we’re generous, we’re drawing upon our generosity reservoir. Like any reservoir, if the supply doesn&#8217;t get topped up, it runs dry. When our generosity has been demanded more than it&#8217;s been topped up, we get crabby and upset. If pushed, we break. But we’re not bad people. We’re just people whose inner supply of generosity hasn’t been filled up quickly enough to cope with the demands that are being made on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2744567495_912dc8142a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7475" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2744567495_912dc8142a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="2744567495_912dc8142a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We suffer from depleted reservoirs of generosity &#8211; but, unfortunately, we don&#8217;t easily recognise that we do. Instead we blame ourselves. We feel it’s our fault for snapping when a more compassionate and helpful interpretation (such as might be offered by the ideal friend who, alas, isn&#8217;t always to hand) would be to say: of course you snapped &#8211; you’d been run dry. You’d been nice to tricky people all day &#8211; actually all week &#8211; and practically no one thanked you. You’d been asked for too much, when the world wasn&#8217;t supporting you enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s needed is a regular exercise of taking a generosity-reservoir audit. What’s the current ratio between you being nice to others and others being nice to you? If the balance is very much on demand over supply, you can be sure a problem is building. Recognising this isn&#8217;t a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of maturity. In exactly the same way that it&#8217;s grown up to admit that one is spending more than one is earning, or not getting enough sleep. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The generosity reservoir is topped up by a lot of things. Physical nurture helps. If you get a good night’s sleep, if you’ve had a healthy breakfast, if you’ve walked to work across a park (rather than battled into a crowded, delayed train). There can be a self-nurture in contemplating a tree or the sky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These good physical things build up our inner reserves and allow us to put our own inclinations to one side and be nice to others &#8211; for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But just as much &#8211; or even more &#8211; the generosity reservoir is fed by psychological nurture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7476" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab.jpg?resize=635%2C438" alt="3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a child one might &#8211; ideally &#8211; have been held and comforted. Another person &#8211; infinitely bigger and stronger &#8211; was always saying how lovely and nice you were; your troubles could be soothed by a few kind words, a grazed knee gently cleaned and tended; your fears (of the dark, of the neighbour’s dog) would be dispelled by this person’s presence: you knew they would protect you and keep you safe. But now you are big and hairy, your mother isn’t around much and she doesn’t really understand your work anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through history, cultures have created substitute mothers to take up the task of psychic nurture &#8211; and renew our capacity to be generous to others. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Catholic Church cast Mary, the mother of Jesus, as a universal mother. Someone who would be there to listen, understand, console and comfort us no matter what our problems and irrespective of our age. We might grow a beard or wear high heels but she would remain the same: unfailingly loving and tender. She was a permanent stream feeding the reservoir of generosity &#8211; because she was generous to us, we could afford to be generous to others. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The figure of Guanyin played a similar role in Buddhist thought. She is the one who listens, offers comfort &#8211; and psychic nurturing &#8211; by hearing our troubles with infinite understanding. No problem was too big or too small to be heard compassionately. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such figures take very seriously the need for a maternal function; they emerge from a realisation that to cope with the pressures of life we need to feel understood and appreciated by someone, especially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if many of the individuals we have to deal with (and serve olives to) conspicuously fail to treat us tenderly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The role they play is important. But there’s another option, if we find it difficult or impossible to believe in them. We have to become our own mothers. It’s not a warped fantasy of genealogy; and it’s not suggesting we literally start to resemble our own mums. The idea builds on a key fact about the mind. There are different aspects to our complex selves. There are ways we can be more childlike (more demanding of attention and help) or alternatively, there are moments when we adopt a more maternal attitude towards ourselves: we treat our own troubles and failing with kindness (just as a very nice real mother, or Guanyin) might. We tell ourselves the more supportive and compassionate stories about who we are. We remind ourselves that &#8211; in fact &#8211; we are decent people, a bit under pressure, of course &#8211; but well-intentioned. This side of the persona is quick to recall our strengths, to take the edge off self-criticism, to give our weaknesses the most charitable interpretation &#8211; and broadly to coax the ego back into shape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3720850121_f8c220c910_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7481" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3720850121_f8c220c910_b.jpg?resize=635%2C530" alt="3720850121_f8c220c910_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve developed a suspicion of self-love based on (actually quite rare) cases where people are much too pleased with themselves. But almost inevitably our problems run in the opposite direction. The averagely decent human being is an expert at self-criticism and hesitant around appreciating their own merits. We’re not normally very good at replenishing our own reservoir of generosity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The care of the self means adopting a higher level of kindness towards ourselves &#8211; in the inner dialogues which dominate existence. The normal running commentary goes like this: ‘you fool, you’ve stuffed up again, why are you so weak and easily upset; you made a complete fool of yourself over the olives; it’s just like that time you started crying when Janine pointed out you’d let everyone down; pull yourself together you stupid weakling.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So we approach any genuine problem from a position of shame and disappointment. The maternal (Mary, Guanyin) voice has a very different line: ‘It’s a pity, you were trying, you always try so hard; it’s all right, it will pass; last week you handled that little disagreement with Marcus so well; you’re going to mange this time too; one cold day doesn’t mean it’s winter; you are such a good person at heart; and part of what&#8217;s nice about you is you worry you’ve let others down. So, it’s going to be OK. Deep down, you’re fine.’ The supportive words start to restore self-respect. They re-equip us to be a little more accommodating and generous to others. We can cope with their quirks and self-absorption, because we’re more secure in our sense of self-worth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is pointing to a key task of management in service-oriented companies. If you want your staff to provide good service, you have to replenish the reservoir of generosity in each of them. You have to be nice to them, if you want them to be nice to the customers. Encouraging self-nurturing in employees might be as &#8211; or more &#8211; important than getting them to read extracts from the health and safety manual. The point isn&#8217;t focused on external celebration, like giving an employee a cake on their birthday (though that’s not a bad idea). It’s more about being, at key times, like Mary or Guanyin, to the staff. You can’t make the problem go away; you can’t make customers be more polite or more considerate; but you can show you are tenderly aware of the pains of dealing with their concerns and deeply appreciative of the generosity it takes to keep on being nice to people who aren&#8217;t very nice back. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Expectations are violated</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong, and customers get upset, when expectations are not met. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/50.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7482" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/50.gif?resize=440%2C560" alt="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">William James &#8211; the brother of the novelist Henry James &#8211; defined the problem: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Happiness = result &#8211; expectation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If what you get is better than you expected, you have a positive experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If expectations are on the low side, the customer may be delighted by quite minor, but charming, levels of service. You mislay your ticket for a multi-storey car park and have to get the manager to help you. You’re expecting an awkward encounter: they’ll be irritated, you’ll be embarrassed. They turn it into a joke &#8211; it happens all the time, it’s not a problem at all, make a wry comment about the difficulty of trying to keep track of everything. You’re charmed. It’s still an ugly environment and it’s not cheap, but you feel a warm glow towards the place. In the future, you always park there whenever you are in the area (though there are two other car parks that are just as convenient). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if your expectations go above and beyond what you get, you feel disappointed and frustrated. It’s not the absolute merits of the service itself that is decisive: it’s how this stacks up against the picture we’ve formed in our heads of what it’s going to be like. This mental picture &#8211; or ‘expectations’ turns out to be a crucial element in the customer’s experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">High expectations around comfort: Luxury</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One big strategy, in the face of expectations, is to meet them, or go beyond them. The concept of luxury suggests that your high expectations will be fulfilled. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-residence-9_Wide.jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-residence-9_Wide.jpg.jpg?resize=635%2C241" alt="the-residence-9_Wide.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;A truly unique and bespoke travel experience, delivered with complete discretion and limitless hospitality &#8211; The Residence by Etihad.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has been created by leading interior designers and hospitality experts who understand the discernment and sophistication expected by the private traveller.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hope is to raise expectation in the market, so your competitor&#8217;s offerings will come to seem unimpressive. In comparison with the Etihad Residence, people come to feel that are roughing it in BA first class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But it’s a dicey undertaking. Because if expectations are raised very high, even a tiny mishap (the champagne is the wrong temperature, the entertainment system has a glitch) can lead to high levels of disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the William James tragedy: you are judged against the hopes and fantasies &#8211; the expectations &#8211; of the customer, rather than the reality of your achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Etihad &#8211; and many others &#8211; very high quality service (or luxury) is understood in terms of physical comfort: no one will disturb you; you won&#8217;t have to wait, you can stretch out, you can eat the most delicious things, drink rare wines, watch films on a large screen, have a shower. It&#8217;s the dominant conception of luxury around service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">High expectations around meaning: Adventure </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What counts as luxury will, of course, depends on the kind of activity in question. For instance, <strong>Alpine Ascents</strong> &#8211; the most successful mountain adventure company of the last decade &#8211; is classed as a ‘luxury’ service provider because it offers a plentiful supply of oxygen and good access to doctors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/65742649_67285258f9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7484" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/65742649_67285258f9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="65742649_67285258f9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Dru!</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike airline companies, Alpine Ascents tries to make the consumer’s expectations realistic: they are very worried about people having high hopes that in reality, can’t be fulfilled. This has worked well because their customer satisfaction ratings are extremely high. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– You have to be in very good physical condition, if you’re not, you can’t do the climb, no matter what you pay. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Instead of seeing luxury in terms of ‘we’ll do everything for you,’ Alpine Ascents aims to teach its clients greater levels of confidence and self-reliance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Alpine Ascents<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>aims to get its customers to appreciate the beauty and grandeur of the mountains. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn’t normally get excited by the idea of getting up at 2am, eating only instant nutrition bars, having a headache, getting very cold and struggling to force oneself to overcome fear and to keep going in spite of exhaustion: which are standard aspects of the experience of climbing a very high mountain. What Alpine Ascents and many other companies are trading on, however, is not simply the customer’s realisation that it will be like this &#8211; so they are not horrified by what actually happens when they get up towards the peak. <em>The key factor in expectations here is not just realism. It’s the idea that the experience is valuable, meaningful and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>worth it. It’s the expectation that ‘I’ll do all that hardship stuff and have a truly great time</em>.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of expectations, therefore isn’t just a tick list of specific features, or details you think the service will include. More importantly, it is shorthand for ‘what I think will make me happy’ in this part of life. And what companies like Alpine Ascents remind us is that we don’t only think that physical comfort will make us happy, we also believe that effort, risk, even hardship experienced in the right cause can be the path to happiness. We intuitively understand (though we easily forget around service) that happiness is as much about meaning and a sense of purpose, as it is about comfort. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Where expectations come from</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Expectations are not a permanent fixture: advertising influences our expectations, as do many wider features of the cultural landscape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It took a very long time for climbing a mountain (and embracing all the hardship this entails) to be attractive to the consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, for example, mountains were not on the tourist map of Europe. The highly lucrative industry focused (to an extent that might now strike us as astonishing) on visiting Roman ruins. Mountains simply didn’t figure in this scheme of good travelling or the well-lived life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But by the start of the 20th century, mountains had become one of the most fashionable and sophisticated destinations. The change in attitude was brought about by poets, artists, philosophers and novelists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7485" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains.jpg?resize=635%2C402" alt="morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caspar David Friedrich’s contribution wasn’t limited to showing people what such places might look like: expect to see crags and ridges of mountain chains. Rather, what he was doing was suggesting &#8211; arguing as passionately as he could visually &#8211; that such were the places where you could find the profound, most important, most exciting human experiences. This, he was saying, is what you need. Yes, it might take a long trek to get there, your fingers will get cold, you’ll feel dizzy at these heights. But it’s worth it. Because this is one of the key experiences of life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Caspar David Friedrich wasn’t formally employed by an advertising agency but, in effect, he was producing material for the Alpine Ascent account. So today, people relish sleeping in a small tent in a blizzard, breathing oxygen from a tank; feeling exhausted isn’t an objection, it’s part of the experience. An experience people would have paid to avoid is now a lucrative market. Not because it’s now ‘nicer’ but because expectations have shifted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The real driver of expectations is a vision of happiness &#8211; that is, of the good, meaningful experience that is part of the well-lived life. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of all service is to make the customer happy (or at least help them flourish) around some particular area of existence. So, good service in a plane is the kind of service that helps you thrive on a journey; good service in a hotel delivers the kind of help that enables you to thrive away from home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The provision of physical pleasures and the reduction of irritants (that is, the things that are typically associated with luxury) is one natural contribution to our well-being. It’s one kind of assistance we might need in order to thrive around some area of activity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The larger set of ‘eudaimonic needs’ (that is, things that help us flourish) includes six other factors: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– independence or self-reliance</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– sense of competence</span></p>
<p class="p1">– self-understanding</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– sociability (the feeling that others are in this too, that we are understood) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– resilience (our capacity to cope with setbacks) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a sense of adventure</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need these things in order to thrive. And without them, it will be very hard for us to feel we are having a great time (even if the pillows are beautifully fluffed and there is a careful selection of winter fruits to hand). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every business can ask itself what other needs (in addition to ease and comfort) it could be helping its customers with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Case Study: IKEA </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the right picture of what they are doing &#8211; the right expectations &#8211; people can come to love all kinds of things, that ordinarily we would imagine would be off-putting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16411054567_b802d1c51c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7486" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16411054567_b802d1c51c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="16411054567_b802d1c51c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA have been one of the leading exponents of this move. At first sight, the idea of being told that you have to assemble your own bed feels like an affront. It’s degrading. Instead of being the customer, you have been co-opted as part of the workforce. You are too mean, or too poor, to buy an actual bed. You have to make do with just purchasing the raw materials out of which you will have to construct it yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What IKEA did was offer customers a very different picture of what it means to assemble your own furniture. That is, they fostered a different set of expectations, drawing on powerful ideas about self-reliance, an egalitarian spirit, a sense of the charm of Swedish modernism. When you are bolting the bits together you don’t feel resentful. You enjoy being this kind of person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it’s so important for them to emphasise their Swedishness &#8211; serving meatballs and gravlax in the cafe, having weird sounding names for things (the BÖRJE chair, the ALÄNG<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>table lamp) and to put pictures and insert mini bios of their designers in their catalogues. Henrik Preutz and Ebba Strandmark are there to promote an idea of an attractive kind of person: one who likes assembling things themselves, whose doesn’t feel it’s in any way degrading to push a vast cart around a warehouse, someone who has no status anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA don’t have to do all the work. We already have some very positive &#8211; though perhaps latent &#8211; associations with self-reliance (and putting together your own bed). In fact, this is a major theme of one of the great American books, Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em>, which tells in enchanting detail of the two years he lived in a little hut (which he built himself, in the ideal IKEA spirit).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/deskchair2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7487" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/deskchair2.jpg?resize=440%2C269" alt="deskchair2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The furniture Thoreau assembled: early advertising for IKEA</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thoreau was the ideal customer. He did not assemble his furniture himself because he was short of money. He was glad to get it cheaply, but there was another big thing in his mind. He wanted to do it himself. He liked the idea that he had put something of himself, his own effort and ingenuity, into the things he lived around. That’s what ready-assembled furniture couldn’t give him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA, of course, was seeking profits. They worked out it was more profitable to get the customers to do some of the labour themselves. They could increase their margins by storing everything flat-packed in their warehouses. But the key insight was that customers would assemble the furniture not simply so as to save money, but because they liked doing it. The service IKEA offered was an attractive vision of the self as a furniture assembler &#8211; with this as a part of a nice, comfortable, interesting life. The power of IKEA depends on the fact that they have tapped into an important truth about life &#8211; and then organised a very efficient business around that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Case Study: Airbnb</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Airbnb has revolutionised the travel industry by changing people’s expectations in a couple of key ways. Around: how you might feel about someone else staying in your place (which unlocked supply) and how you might feel about staying in someone else’s place (which unlocked demand). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Airbnb helped make accommodation cheaper. But their proposition wasn&#8217;t just about that. They were also arguing that other people are generally very trustworthy and that you too are trustworthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The <em>expectation shift</em> here is profound and intimate.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Central to the service is a vision of happiness around travel. They’re making the case that in order to travel well and have a good time, your attitude, your independence and your curiosity about meeting new people are important. And their service taps into these aspects of you &#8211; in ways that the traditional idea of the hotel does not. Airbnb is offering a lower level of service in some areas: they don’t provide room service or valet parking, there’s not going to be someone in a tailcoat to open the door. Rather than solve the problems around getting a sandwich at 3am, parking your car and opening the door,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Airbnb concentrates on addressing a different range of issues that are equally relevant to having a good holiday (and maybe rather more relevant). They’re connecting you with the more trusting, more generous, more confident, more self-reliant &#8211; which makes for a better trip. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alpine Ascents, IKEA and Airbnb are examples of service companies that have built great commercial success on the back of educating their customer’s expectations, which means they have promoted a particular insight into what can make us happy. The core move is that they are not only relying on the traditional luxury conception of happiness as physical comfort. That’s not wildly wrong &#8211; because physical comfort is a contribution to happiness. But there are many other factors that contribute as much to the flourishing life, like self-reliance, trust, a sense of adventure. Being helped to develop these aspects of oneself is a true service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> All service aims at making the customer happy. But service has typically focused on only a few of the things that could contribute to our happiness. Educating expectations really means helping us see how things we’ve not paid enough attention to can make a big contribution to our lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Thought experiments </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a thought experiment, we could imagine this move being made in other service areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hotel</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an advert for the Park Hyatt chain, George Clooney has to wait five minutes to check into the hotel. But he’s not seething. He knows patience is a virtue. He understands that sometimes things just do get a bit busy. He’s being mature about it. He looks at the little vignettes of life going on all around. The wise man is never bored, because the world is endlessly fascinating.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Even very well-run hotels are going to face such issues &#8211; at some point, three people are going to want to talk to the concierge or eight people need taxis at the same moment. In theory, all this could be solved with more and more staff. But this would lead to the hotel being in a different price bracket. The point is, being a mainstream luxury hotel still involves lots of little problems. The hotel is promoting the idea of the mature<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>guest who is well able to cope with these minor irritations. And who knows that instantaneous perfection is not the key to happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Airline</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">British Airways could promote the important virtue of not letting the unavoidable get you down. In economy, there’s a nicely dressed, modestly attractive woman squashed between two over-sized men. Then there’s an announcement that (through no fault of the airline) they’re going to have to wait on the tarmac for an hour and five minutes. She doesn’t roll her eyes or let out a long sigh. She’s going to be fine. She takes out a well-thumbed, much annotated paperback copy of the <em>Meditations</em> of Marcus Aurelius and starts reading, there’s just the tiniest smile on her face. She is being perfectly British, perfectly British Airways. Their slogan:<em> Rise Above Everything</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, she’s standing waiting to use the loo. A steward is passing with a tray and suddenly the plane lurches and the tray falls spectacularly to the floor. The stewardess is embarrassed and makes frantic apologies. Our nice woman bends down to help and gives a warm smile: you mustn’t worry, these things can’t be helped. It’s perfectly all right. She puts a little carton of orange juice back on the tray. <em>The best people fly BA</em>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wise patience and a stiff upper lip are real virtues. That is, they really do assist you in leading a happier life. The company that fosters them in their customers is doing those people a big service. They are getting more directly to the true goal of all service: the happiness of the customer. They are not excuses for sloppy service: the point is that unless we buy a much more expensive ticket (or, ideally a private jet) travel just is going to involve a range of difficult experiences. Helping us cope with those is a genuine and important service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the top luxury end, the airline company might compete with Etihad not by offering an even larger bed or greater water pressure in the private shower, but by widening the range of needs that it addresses.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for accomplishment</em>: you can sit in the cockpit during landing or &#8211; under careful supervision, flick a switch that’s part of the sequence for engaging the autopilot, the pilot gives you a quick lesson.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for sociability</em>: have a cocktail with an interesting, distinguished or just rather lovely person on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for participation</em>: take a brief call with a board member, or the head of marketing, to discuss your views of the company and the key challenges of the industry. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Tea at the Ritz </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tea service takes certain problems very seriously. Great attention and skill has been devoted to ensuring that the sandwiches while very thin are not soggy. They’ve worked out how to keep the teapot hot for half an hour and what the ideal density of tables is &#8211; you don’t want to feel crowded by others, but it’s nice to sense that other people are around: you can see them and they can see you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The Ritz does these things very well indeed. But other needs go unaddressed and are not yet on the agenda as things that good service can and should address. They are not rare needs or preferences (such as jam made from Californian Olallieberries). They are some of the main obstacles we might face when trying to have a sociable afternoon.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>Having one’s melancholy acknowledged</em>. One customer out of three is probably feeling a bit melancholy. It’s not that some terrible disaster has befallen them, they are just struck by the brevity of life or are conscious of how many opportunities they have let slip or they feel more acutely than usual how hard it is for people genuinely to understand one another. These are not problems to be solved, but perceptions to be acknowledged and perhaps shared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>What good service might include</em>: the demeanour of the waiter allows you to feel low-key, a bit withdrawn into yourself; they are not trying to jolly you along. An existentialist notepad and a set of psychoanalytic pencils is included as an item on the menu (i.e. something you might very naturally like to have at this time, just as you might also like to have a slice of cake).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>The difficulty of conversing interestingly with people you might not know very well</em>. This is a major social need, but we are left entirely alone with it at the moment by the service provider. You are expected to bring your own conversation. In the future, this omission might look as strange as it would today to expect customers to bring their own milk, or their own tables with them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Good service could extend to</em>: an elegant conversation menu card is placed on the table as a matter of course &#8211; looking at one of these is not an admission of failure; here it is regarded as a wise and sophisticated thing to do. The hotel has a conversation code, just as &#8211; at the moment &#8211; it has a dress code: men are currently required to wear a tie and a jacket and jeans are barred. Equally, it could include an introduction service: you will be very nicely introduced to another individual or group. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of the company is to edge us towards a good set of expectations &#8211; that is a vision of the kind of help we’d ideally like and would benefit from getting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Trouble with details</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong when a detail is neglected that, unfortunately, has a big impact on the customer’s experience: an assistant seems aloof; the mini-bar fridge hums in the night; the toast is cold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daily life is filled with disconcerting examples of little things that have big consequences. You meet your partner in a bar after work and you start to mention that you’ve had a rather difficult day. They listen for a minute and then say in an off-hand manner: ‘poor you. Listen, you know the Jaguar XE, it’s now in production.’ You are deeply wounded. The problem is all in the details: it’s that when they said ‘poor you’, they were looking at their glass. And you are quite interested in the new Jaguar marque, but the timing was a problem; they didn’t pause between ‘poor you’ and mentioning the car. Two seconds would have been enough.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You seem to be upset by the tiniest things: your partner’s inferior rectus eye muscles momentarily contracted; they didn’t take a breath mid-sentence. It can all seem out of proportion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we can understand why. These details carry a large meaning: your partner doesn’t seem to care very much about what happened to you during the day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Or, someone doesn’t put the cap back on the toothpaste tube and it starts to drive their partner wild. It’s a small thing in itself but it means: this person is negligent and sloppy &#8211; right across life. The toothpaste is just the point where a bigger problem comes into focus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a commercial service context there are three issues around detail: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– noticing detail </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– understanding why a detail matters</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– being selective about which details to focus on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s look at each in turn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Teaching sensitivity </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daily life desensitises us. We’re in a hurry; there’s so much noise, dirt, so much evidence of human sorrow &#8211; we start to shut it out. We stop noticing. It’s a very understandable form of self-defence. But this means that sometimes we’re not sensitive enough. We need to be re-sensitised to certain things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around service, the challenge is sometimes to get the staff to see and feel the importance of details which they usually don’t notice or especially care about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Essentially, a detail is something that’s <em>easy to overlook</em>. So, in order to get good at dealing well with detail, we need to get into the habit of paying attention. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7494" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus.jpg?resize=635%2C531" alt="Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn’t usually pay a lot of attention to the visual details of a bunch of asparagus. But Manet was very sensitive to the attraction of the lilac tips, the white flesh of the stalk, the nice contrast with the bed of green leaves and the charm of binding them with thick golden-brown twine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Manet has directed a lot of attention in an unusual &#8211; but rewarding &#8211; direction. And when we’ve seen him do this, we start to get more sensitive ourselves: we become more attentive. We notice more details. We become more alert to the ways something can be more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- or less &#8211; attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy can do this too. For instance, it’s not very normal for people to think about how they stand &#8211; it’s not something modern culture tends to pay much attention to. But how an assistant or a waiter stands can make a big difference: without realising it, their posture communicates something to the customer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pompeo_Batoni_Italian_Lucchese_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7495" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pompeo_Batoni_Italian_Lucchese_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="Pompeo_Batoni_(Italian_(Lucchese)_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot,_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">18th-century portraits like this one showing an English aristocrat and his dog on holiday in Italy don’t literally show the ideal way to stand when serving someone a glass of orange juice and an almond croissant. What they do is sensitise us to the way posture is a form of communication: a language. They do this by showing us a posture that’s so unfamiliar that we can’t help noticing it. Through looking at an extreme case, we notice the relevant elements: the title of the head, the distance of the hands from the body, the alignment of the feet. It’s a vehicle for promoting sensitivity to detail. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What a detail is doing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In art and architecture, the role of the detail has long been taken very seriously indeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Parthenon, at the summit of the Athens Acropolis may well be &#8211; despite its ruinous state &#8211; one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Certainly, it is one of the most influential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7496" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Tiny details make all the difference</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the source of its visual magnetism isn’t at first obvious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The base on which the temple stands &#8211; for instance, isn’t actually flat. It curves very gently down from the middle. You’d not notice (unless you tried to lay a completely straight 20-metre iron bar on it). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The columns lean slightly towards the centre &#8211; again you can’t easily tell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/parthenon-curves.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7497" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/parthenon-curves.jpg?resize=440%2C625" alt="parthenon-curves" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The details <em>exaggerated</em>: in reality we can hardly see them</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such details can sound a bit obscure. But they are what make the building appear effortlessly poised, balanced and serene. Less accomplished architects didn’t realise that such details could make a big difference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same move (attending to a detail which helps produce an important overall effect) can be seen at work in a modern service context. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A great chef adds a little parmesan to the sauce, you might not know this. But you love the effect. The fish somehow seems more savoury than usual. They did a little thing &#8211; they grated a few grams of cheese &#8211; but it made a big difference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A medium-sized accountancy firm might put very good art on the walls of the rooms where they have meeting with clients. They haven’t spent much money on them: they’re just some elegantly-mounted photographs (from, perhaps, X’s series: the life of accountants). It’s an eloquent detail. They are deftly signalling that they’ve got a good perspective on the world of tax law, returns, investments and asset management. Money is serious, of course, but it sits within the larger issue of getting one’s life to go well. This detail says: ‘We might be talking about the taxation aspects of renting out your holiday cottage in Cornwall (it might be best in your circumstances to set this up as a small business) but we haven’t forgotten that you are a human being.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7498" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A sales assistant in an upmarket clothes shop has a way of asking ‘can I help you?’ that feels both genuine and friendly: the tone in which they say these words is minutely different from a colder way of speaking. It’s a tiny difference, but it&#8217;s showing that here is someone who is really on the side of the customer, who has their best interests at heart. The detail is tiny but the meaning, for the customer, is large. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The smile of the person at the check-in desk could make up for having to stand in a queue for fifteen minutes to reach them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good service company works back to the detail by first understanding the important effect they are aiming at. Then they work back and ask themselves what little things that effect depends on. They don’t just randomly seize on some little thing and try to get that perfect. Their attention to this detail is motivated by a big ambition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the same reasons, though, getting a little thing wrong can have a big effect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– In a cafe, the music is a little too loud: which implies that this isn’t a place to think or read or have a conversation. You can ask for it to be turned down &#8211; but the problem is they didn’t notice it on their own.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– In a smart restaurant, the waiter hovers. There’s a major difference between keeping an attentive but discreet eye on how a diner is doing and being intrusive. It could make the difference between great and terrible service. But in physical terms we might only be looking at small details here: the distance the waiter is from the table; how relaxed they seem; whether they glance or stare. Hovering has a bigger, and negative meaning: lack of confidence. Hovering says: ‘I don’t know how to look after you.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– An airline prides itself on making announcements in six languages, a little touch designed to show their cosmopolitan character, but by the time they have interrupted your viewing of <em>House of Cards</em> for the fifth time to explain in Russian how to fasten a seatbelt, you are getting desperate and wish that anyone on board who can only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>learn to ‘clip it in as shown’ in this one language &#8211; despite it&#8217;s being mimed multiple times already &#8211; would simply disappear. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A car is designed in such a way that you can’t see the speedometer when you turn the steering wheel. It irks you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>all the time and &#8211; despite liking a lot of other things about the vehicle &#8211; you go for another make next time round. It’s a tiny thing, in a way: but it’s just cost the manufacturer your loyalty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Which details to pay attention to</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, artists were preoccupied with attending to <strong>every</strong> detail of appearance. If you asked them which details it was most important to get right they would say: ‘all of them’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7500" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e.jpg?resize=440%2C598" alt="61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The English artist, John William Waterhouse (1849 &#8211; 1917)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>for instance, was typical in his attention to detail: he was precise about the creases of the neck and the shape of the cheekbone; he carefully noted every strand of hair. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, Matisse can seem terribly negligent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7501" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_19511" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we don’t look at Matisse and think: what a careless guy, why didn’t he pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>proper attention to her hair? He hasn’t even bothered to give her nostrils, or complete the outline of her eyes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matisse wasn’t being shoddy. He was very concerned with<strong> some</strong> details: the angle of the head is really important, the position of her mouth is perfect, though it’s defined by only two strokes of the pen. The way her hair curls over her forehead is delightful, though it’s been presented with the greatest possible economy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He could afford to be selective &#8211; he could be economical &#8211; because he knew what he was aiming it: an effect of flirtatious sweetness, which actually doesn&#8217;t require much attention to every strand of hair or the shape of her cheekbones. In effect, he asked himself which details he likes. He finds this person’s face charming and he wants to identify the key factors. It’s not just everything about her face that’s sweet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The two, closely-connected moves that Matisse brings to our attention are: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– be selective about which details to concentrate on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– select the details that matter for achieving a particular goal or effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This move can be applied in various service areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Details of service for a serene hotel </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The staff are pleasant to talk to, but sometimes they will be a bit inefficient &#8211; they might read a book during a slack period. The relevant detail here is being rounded, natural and interesting, rather than focused on achievement. This has a calming effect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– They don’t have fridges in the rooms (there are very few things that need to be kept below room temperature in a bedroom), instead they have silent cooler boxes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The artwork is beautiful and tranquil.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The selection at breakfast is quite limited; they concentrate on perfect fruit juice and exceptional scrambled eggs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The films and content on the in-room television system are selected for their ability to provide calm perspective.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Details of service for a clothes store that welcomes nervous men</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The changing cubicles are quite large, they have doors that shut; the assistant knocks.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The restaurant has house ‘rules’ for children, which are strongly (but tactfully) promoted by the staff, which (like the ideal school) takes some of the burden off the parents.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: The art of apology is neglected</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inevitably around service things sometimes go wrong. The plane is delayed. The scrambled eggs are watery; the car-hire company has mixed up the booking; the architect has misunderstood a point you’d made clear. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When service goes wrong we want a couple of things to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>One</em>: we want the problem solved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Two</em>: we want an apology &#8211; we want people to recognise how painful this problem has been for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But companies often overlook the importance of saying sorry because they are focusing their efforts on trying to solve the problem. And because they fear that apologising opens you to attack: you are admitting you are wrong and people will make you pay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Saying sorry isn’t an excuse for poor service. Even very well-run service companies will make mistakes; it’s how you handle them that matters. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A good apology has two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>key components: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It demonstrates empathy: you put yourself in the shoes of the customer and identify with their suffering, frustration and anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It explains without being defensive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(The art of saying sorry is one of the ways commerce is like the rest of life: things we learn around work can help us.) </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are overseas and try to use a cash machine. For some reason the machine can’t help you &#8211; maybe they are out of cash or maybe the satellite connection between Verona and X (wherever VISA do their central things) has momentarily failed. The machine flashes you a terse announcement: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">You have been denied access to this service</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The curt refusal would make sense if you were trying steal some money. It sounds like a committee has sat in judgment on you and run a red line through your name. The announcement imagines that the customer is up to something disreputable. It’s very anxiety-provoking to be seen this way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead the bank could announce: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">We’re really sorry. There’s a glitch somewhere &#8211; we don’t know why. But we do know how maddening this is.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Very occasionally they will flash up this cheerful, kindly message to an identity fraudster. They could calculate the odds: 3,095 deeply anxious customers v. 1 gleeful (but not actually any the richer) fraudster. It’s a risk worth taking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This apology is in effect saying: you and I are on the same side. We’d all like this service to be good. And, unfortunately, it isn’t right now. We’re remembering what it is like to be in your situation. We, too, have had moments when the cash machine wouldn’t accept a card. We weren’t trying to defraud someone. We were just people in a hurry being frustrated by a technical problem. We know that’s what you’re like too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Apology as explanation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 19th-century England, the rising start of the national Anglican church was a man called John Henry Newman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By his late thirties, he was the most influential figure in the Church of England. He was particularly admired for his harsh attacks on the Roman Catholic church &#8211; seen, in those days, as the natural enemy of the English church.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he turned forty, he changed his mind. He decided that, after all, the Catholics were right. He swapped sides &#8211; and became the leader of the Catholics instead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7506" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">He embarrassed and upset his friends</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, he caused huge offence to a large number of people. His friends felt betrayed. A lot of people were very angry with him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He responded by writing what he called an <strong>Apologia</strong>. It’s the autobiographical record of the experiences and ideas that lead him to swap sides. He didn’t just confront people with a brute fact: I used to agree with you, now I think you’re wrong. He told the story of the small steps that took him from where he had to been to where he was now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An apologia is like an apology &#8211; but there’s one key difference: you don’t think you’ve actually done anything wrong. You know that other people are very upset. And you take their hurt and annoyance very seriously indeed. You’re not surprised they are angry &#8211; though you believe that if they knew the whole story, they would be much more forgiving and accepting. They might even come to share your point of view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An apologia is an explanation that engages with how upset and annoyed other people are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The situation Newman found himself in is familiar in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>commercial service context. The customer is unhappy and upset. The company maybe isn’t actually to blame. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This happens a lot around the rail system.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6643371001_ab90414dbd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7507" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6643371001_ab90414dbd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6643371001_ab90414dbd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the station, the train operator flashes up the stark message: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 11.30 to Bristol Temple Meads has been cancelled. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The frustrated passenger crowded on the platform has a picture of the rail company: they are lazy, they make dopey blunders, they don’t care about the passengers. The delay is entirely their fault; if they were more competent, this wouldn’t happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the point of view of the train operator, it all looks very different. The delay has been caused by something the rail company has no control over: wet leaves are sticking to the rails and reducing traction and making breaking difficult. It’s so bad they are going to have suspend the service and send in a special vehicle to clean the tracks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the train companies were to say more about what is going on, their first instinct might be to show their irritation. They could be tempted to broadcast a message like this: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘It’s the leaves, not us. Why can’t you understand that? Quit complaining.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What they need to do is undertake an apologia: an explanation that’s specifically geared to acknowledging and diffusing the anger the passengers feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1564361644_38bf025517_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7508" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1564361644_38bf025517_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="1564361644_38bf025517_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Britain has lovely trees; it’s a great thing about this country. We’ve all had moments when we’ve been touched by their beauty and quiet dignity. But trees cause difficulties too. In October and November, when the leaves fall, it often rains; inevitably, damp leaves end up on the rails. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When trains run over them, the pressure of the wheels make these leaves stick very tightly to the top of the rails. A kind of slippery leaf coating builds up on the track and the trains can’t break properly. So the line has to be cleaned. We used sand, a special citrus-based cleaning agent to remove the build up. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deepest form of apology is to share with another person the real nature of the task; to say &#8211; ultimately &#8211; we are trying to do this fascinating thing. We’re trying to provide a reliable rail service in a country that loves trees and woodland. It’s one instance of a huge civilisation-defining task: how can we have beauty and efficiency at the same time? Unfortunately, aiming at both these things means that sometimes there are going to be difficult moments. This is one of them. We’re really sorry it is your journey that is being messed up today. We know that’s maddening but we hope you’ll bear with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They aren’t simply saying, we’re very sorry. They’ve got a bigger ambition. Like Newman, the rail company is offering an apologia: an explanation of what is really going on. They are trying to lead the customer from their suffering to an understanding of the bigger issue that’s at stake. In the belief that understanding will soften the irritation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How much inconvenience people will put up with, in the name of a grand cause: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the 18th of June 1940, Charles de Gaulle made a radio speech from the Broadcasting House in London.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/48092167_001215507-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7511" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/48092167_001215507-1.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="_48092167_001215507-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve made a lot of mistakes but we’re going to keep trying </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">France had just been invaded, the army was in disarray. He himself had fled a couple of days before. He admitted many mistakes had been made.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He was asking for the support and loyalty of French people everywhere. He didn’t have much to offer them. He couldn’t offer people security or a salary. Nevertheless, many thousands of people instantly responded. And we understand why: eventually they were going to recover their country and restore its honour. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Mistakes have been made, there have been delays and untold suffering, but the fact remains that there still exists in the world everything we need to crush our enemies some day.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">De Gaulle understood that people are motivated by many things and amongst the strongest motivators is participation in a great project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7512" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">One day we will make it here: the grand cause justifies the pain and the effort</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">De Gaulle represents the extreme version of a general, widespread point. Human beings are remarkably good at putting up with difficulties if they believe the cause is worthwhile: parents get up in the middle of the night to feed their babies and life-boat crews will face appalling seas. Or, in sport we’ll make ourselves keep running to complete the half-marathon or get up at five in the morning to perfect one’s backstroke when the pool is empty. They all point to the same psychological fact: it’s not being uncomfortable in itself that bothers people; it’s the feeling of having to put up with inconvenience for no very good reason. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ten: We don’t understand what’s good about good service</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to think that the range of things that can be learned is quite limited. You can learn to polish silver or to carry a tray or make a safety announcement. But you can’t learn to smile warmly or be more empathetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the reasons service goes wrong is that it isn’t ambitious enough around the idea of education. We don’t spend enough time studying role models of good service. In the past, religions made great use of this move. They’d encourage people to think a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lot about what an ideal role model would do in particular circumstances. Christianity, of course, was always asking people to think about what Jesus or one of the saints might do or say at challenging moments. There were many images of the charitable actions of St. Francis of Assisi &#8211; for instance, of the time he gave away his spare blue cloak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7524" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm1.jpg?resize=222%2C371" alt="sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">A reminder of how you might ideally treat others in need</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basic principle is a general one: we can learn to do things better by paying close attention to what the best people are doing and understanding what it is they are getting right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the best waiters in the world is Stefano Lombardi who works at the Hotel de Russie, near Piazza del Popolo in Rome. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7514" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">He is dignified</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dignity might not be the first word that comes to mind when we think of the good server. But what it means is that the server’s self-respect isn’t on the line. They’re already sure of their own worth. So they don’t need to prove it to the customer. Stefano behaves naturally. His politeness is never forced or fake. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Stefano remembers the humanity of those he serves </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He knows that someone might be a bit down, that life has many difficulties that a <em>caffè freddo</em> cannot solve. So he’s not attempting to ensure that his customers are jolly and bright all the time. Rather, he’s attuned to their mood. He might be serving a quail-egg omelette and yet signal with a wry smile that &#8211; after all &#8211; it is only an omelette. And no matter how nice or exotic it is, it cannot repair a damaged marriage or undo a deal that’s gone sour or bring a father and son closer. He’s not pretending it can. What you feel, as he gently puts the plate down, is his discreet sympathy. It’s not anything he says. It’s what he’s thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3590261638_fe567f13b5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7515" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3590261638_fe567f13b5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3590261638_fe567f13b5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘When I look at some of the people who come in here, I think, there’s a nice person who is having a rough day. Maybe they just want to be quiet; maybe they want to forget their troubles for a little while. Maybe they just need someone to treat them with kindness after a few too many bruising experiences. I’m always alert for the little signals that show me what&#8217;s going on for a customer. I never judge them. I never badger a customer. I don’t suggest: would you like this, or why don’t you try that, until I’ve got a sense of what’s going on for them.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">He treats each customer as an individual </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plastic or robotic service means treating all customers in the same way. The server wishes the person a good day, not because they wish this specific individual a good day, but because they say it to everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal service company would have a statue of its version of Stefano in their head offices. New service staff would be told stories about him, and maybe they’d get to meet him one day. They’d be encouraged to ask ‘what would Stefano do’ in tricky situations: when a customer is complaining unreasonably; when you’ve made a slight mistake and want to apologise; when a couple is lingering too long at a table when they’ve finished their meal; when a customer is making too much noise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single most important secret Stefano possesses, however, is his conviction that what he does matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Being kind to other people is one of the central tasks of life. Good service means, in effect, kindness: understanding what another person needs, treading delicately when you find a sore spot. I may only be bringing them a cup of tea or a glass of prosecco. But it represents something universal: cheerful generosity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting good at service involves creating the right internal culture in a company. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the second Saturday of April each year, people in New York with Scottish ancestry dress up in kilts and tartan socks, play the bagpipes and parade up 6th Avenue (starting from W45th Street). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> They are teaching themselves ‘Scottishness’. The rest of the time they might be taxi drivers, investment analysts, stay-at-home parents and high school teachers. But for a little while they are reconnecting with and strengthening this particular part of their identity. The people who established the parade had exactly that in mind. They were acutely aware of how easily a sense of national identity could get eroded in New York. So they set out deliberately to encourage it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are picking up on a basic fact about people: we are usually very open to suggestions about how to behave. In an art gallery, we move more slowly, we talk quietly, we feel very respectful towards authority. We are highly responsive to environmental cues about how to behave. The organiser of New York’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>tartan march don’t leave the environmental signals to chance: they have particular songs, stories, poems, special clothes, food, musical instruments, flags. Each item operates with the same core conviction: certain things that go on<em> outside</em> affect what goes on <em>inside us</em>. The kilts, haggis, bagpipes and feathered caps are all used in order to promote a set of emotions: pride and loyalty. They get people to<em> feel</em> Scottish by surrounding them with <em>signs</em> of Scottishness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Corporate identity is fostered using the same mechanism. The company can foster a culture of good service by marshalling a helpful set of signals: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The CEO shows their own dedication to service.</em> The CEO happens to be running the show; but they believe in the dignity of the service the company offers. They can still serve, occasionally. Service isn’t something you get promoted out of. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the reasons why our efforts to sell things go wrong is an underlying feeling that ‘selling’ is a bad thing to do. We’ve internalised an image of selling drawn from capitalism’s worst moments, which gives rise to a suspicion that selling somehow injures those to whom we sell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur Miller’s play <em>Death of a Salesman</em> &#8211; first performed in 1949 &#8211; is full of pathos and compassion climaxing around the death of Willy Loman, the exhausted, disappointed, middle-aged salesman of the title. The play has been hugely successful, moving audiences from Broadway to China to tears. We feel Willy was an ordinary, good-enough man &#8211; who deserved but didn’t get a fair share of happiness and fulfilment. His life as a salesman left him crumpled and defeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He never accomplished anything; his life was wasted. ‘Salesman’ becomes the name of a person who lived a crummy, inauthentic life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-3422290.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7229" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-3422290.jpg?resize=635%2C600" alt="Death Of A Salesman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to paint a grim portrait of the salesperson: someone constantly looking out for some way to take advantage of whomever they meet and trying to sell friends and strangers things they can’t afford. A salesperson is someone whose smile can’t be trusted; someone living a life of lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, the moral status of a salesperson isn’t fixed, it all depends on the value of what they are selling. When a doctor urgently recommends surgery to the stomach, we don’t think of this as an act of ‘salesmanship,’ because the procedure (though it might make money for many people along the way) seems plainly and objectively necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/203408503_87e70c707a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7233" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/203408503_87e70c707a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="203408503_87e70c707a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bad image of selling is a consequence of the experience of selling stuff that is unaligned to people’s genuine needs: like too many Krispy Kreme donuts or a Cotoletta Veneziana in a tourist-trap restaurant off the Grand Canal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve got many vivid pictures of dishonourable selling. But we don’t yet have a correspondingly clear sense of the honourable version. Good selling means uniting an audience with things it really requires to flourish, which means that there is a lot more scope for honest selling than we are perhaps currently ready to acknowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Honourable salesmanship requires a sense of the possibility of honourable capitalism. This doesn’t mean a world in which we’re only trying to sell organic beans and rope sandals. Many companies are already doing good &#8211; they’re selling reliable dishwashers and nicely designed garden furniture, good quality skin moisturiser or excellent paper clips. But even these companies often have an unhelpful sense of what they need to tell the world in order to sell their products &#8211; and in the process, they lose sight of the good they actually do. Good salesmanship starts with a feeling that there can be such a thing as selling someone something they really require to flourish. It means overcoming the shame of being in sales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Exaggeration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the many ways in which salesmanship goes wrong is through a feeling that we need to exaggerate the virtues of a product, service or person &#8211; to prove acceptable to a buyer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands Board of Tourism is responsible for marketing the Dutch countryside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beautiful_holland_1400x1050.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7181" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beautiful_holland_1400x1050.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="beautiful_holland_1400x1050" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">To lure visitors, it has decided to employ images of very neat windmills by pristine canals, with flowers along the banks &#8211; and extremely sunny skies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are indeed occasional places and a few days of the year when the Netherlands is actually like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But there are many other aspects of the Dutch countryside that the Board of Tourism stays quiet about: it’s often overcast, there are many places where there’s not a flower to be seen, and there’s always quite a lot of mud. You’ll encounter many a wonky old sluice gate and some rickety pailings shoring up the bank. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To avoid annoying and disappointing their customers, the team at the Netherlands Tourist Board should ideally have consulted a painting in the nation’s main art gallery, the Rijksmuseum, by the 17th-century artist Jacob van Ruisdael. Van Ruisdael loved the Dutch countryside, he spent as much time as he could there, and he was very keen to let everyone know what he liked about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead of carefully selecting a special (and unrepresentative) spot and waiting for a rare and fleeting moment of bright sunshine, he adopted a very different ‘selling’ strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7182" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1.jpg?resize=635%2C524" alt="The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling the Netherlands</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His most famous painting is an advert for the qualities he discovered. And they’re much more representative of what Holland is generally like. He loved overcast days. And so he carefully studied the fascinating characteristic movements in the sky: he was entranced by the infinite gradations of grey and how you’ll often see a patch of fluffy white brightness drifting behind a darker, billowing mass of rain cloud. He didn’t deny there was mud or that the river and canal banks are sometimes quite messy. Instead he noticed their special kind of beauty and made a case for it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands Tourist Board, like so many corporations, felt the reality of what it was selling was unacceptable and so had to resort &#8211; for the nicest reasons, out of modesty &#8211; to lies. But the Dutch countryside is filled with merits: it’s quiet and solemn. It encourages tranquil contemplation. It’s an antidote to stress and forced cheerfulness. These are things we might really need to cope with our overloaded and often plastified lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not only corporations that go in for exaggeration. It’s a standard move in all selling. It’s going on when a parent encourages a hesitant teenage child to learn French because, as they put it, it’s the language of love and haute cuisine and because Paris is at the centre of the fashion world. These are attractive notions. But actually learning the language will likely prove a huge disappointment if it is sold in these exaggerated terms, because what the thirteen-year-old is really being sold is Tuesday mornings trying to remember which verbs take être and evenings in their bedroom trying to work out the difference between the past perfect and the past imperfect tenses. Which won’t feel like it has much to do with the little black Chanel dress. The parent’s selling strategy didn’t rest on an untruth. It just deployed an exaggeration. And exaggerations are always likely to lead to trouble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15874483941_d29d1c1976_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7246" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15874483941_d29d1c1976_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="15874483941_d29d1c1976_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They could, instead, have tried to identify the real merits of learning a tricky language: that one gets practice in doing things that are difficult (which is an ideal preparation for much of life); that the experience of gradual but real progress is an important one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or that cultivating a habit of getting exact about fiddly things (like tenses) is maybe just the training they need to balance out their inclination to be vague. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What matters in all acts of truly successful, honest selling is an honourable foregrounding of a thing’s actual virtues &#8211; and a confidence that these virtues will in time prove enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not so easy to sell this way, because it requires an all-too elusive confidence to sidestep the standard over-sunny stock approaches. But it’s a confidence that should emerge from an understanding of human psychology: we’re all very prepared to accept the less than perfect, if only we can be guided with skill and charm. Exaggeration is a nervous first move in salesmanship. But, as we know yet keep forgetting, things sell best over the long term when the real merits of things are brought out, even if those merits happen to be rather quiet and modest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Idealisation </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad salesmanship believes that seduction requires idealised presentations of life: perfect health, strength, vigour, purposefulness, beauty, family dynamics and love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the way Jaguar has been selling its cars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aod-jaguar-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7183" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aod-jaguar-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="aod-jaguar-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He’s in perfect shape, his body is at one with his mind &#8211; the ideal instrument of his masculine will; he never gets rebuffed. He doesn’t get assailed by the feeling that his life might be meaningless. He’s not prey to regret, shame, embarrassment or the nagging feeling that he’s a disappointment to his parents. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When confronted with sales pitches like this, we’re likely to recoil. It’s not because we don’t find the images attractive: they’re lovely. It’s because we know in our hearts that our lives (and our bodies) are not much like those on display in the ads. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike the character in the Jaguar, a man of forty might have an unreliable libido (he tries not to think of the fiasco on a business trip to Milan); sex with his partner has become a matter of begging. His stomach is starting to hang over his belt, and the bald patch at the back of his head makes him want to weep. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies are missing an opportunity. They might be able to sell more by acknowledging the truth about people’s lives. The solution lies in reminding ourselves of the charm of not idealising. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The appeal of realism is not so well known in commerce; but it’s got a great track record in art. The Italian sculptor, Antonio Canova &#8211; who was at the height of his career in the last years of the 18th Century &#8211; specialised in making marble figures more perfect than any we might encounter in the flesh. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7185" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg?resize=635%2C571" alt="903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But consider the paintings of Rembrandt for a quite different approach to physical beauty. One of the people Rembrandt thought most lovely in the world was Hendrickje Stoffels. And because he painted this portrait of her, a lot of other people find her delightful too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7186" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167.jpg?resize=635%2C581" alt="Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But she’s not conventionally very beautiful. Her neck is quite fleshy, her cheeks are round rather than chiseled, and her mouth is rather small. She’s not very thin either. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s interested in her appearance. She wants to look good. She’s arranged her hair carefully. She’s put on earrings. She’s looped a golden chain seductively around her neck. She’s rouged her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet her face is so appealing not because it is geometrically perfect, but because it seems to convey what’s alluring about her personality: she could get quite sad and thoughtful, she could get confused and embarrassed. She could get angry at times, but she’d likely be quite ready to forgive. She’s warm. She looks as if she could be very understanding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we feel we want to look great, it doesn’t mean we want to be perfect. It means we want to be liked and appreciated for what we feel might be most important about our natures. The average fashion brand could profitably imagine what it would be like to employ Rembrandt to devise some advertising for them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wouldn’t start with physical issues &#8211; what can I do about my thin lips, how can I disguise my wrinkles, I’d like my nose to be less prominent &#8211; though he’d get to them later. He’d start by defining attractiveness, rather than perfect beauty. And he’d build an initial campaign round the idea; what do the very beautiful really want: do they want to be liked? He’d be driving a psychological wedge between two ideas we’ve confused: physical beauty and attractiveness. Physical beauty is a guess about what’s genuinely appealing. But it can’t be quite right because Hendricjke is<em> more</em> attractive than the average supermodel, though by the standards of physical beauty Hendrickje is far less perfect. He’s advertising a fundamental truth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s return to the landscape. Up until the early years of the 19th century, the English landscape was painted in idealised terms. Artists would go to Italy and look at sunsets over the bay of Naples or climb hills and gaze down at sun-kissed plains; they delighted in serene skies and feathery trees. And when they returned to Derbyshire or Surrey they’d paint these places in the same Italianate terms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Syon-Richard-Wilson-1760-70.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7187" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Syon-Richard-Wilson-1760-70.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="E0702 WILSON 14559" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Richard Wilson, <em>Syon House</em>, c. 1761</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John Constable, on the other hand, got interested in identifying the real charms of the English landscape as he actually saw them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hampstead-heath.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hampstead-heath.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="hampstead-heath.jpg!Large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cloudy sky could be lovely, the sandy colour of a gravel pit is actually very nice; the dumpy little hills are sweet. Instead of pretending the place lived up to an impossible ideal, he became very attentive to its odder but still very real attractions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like Rembrandt or Constable, a series of adverts used by VW in the 1970s explore the appeal of the ordinary and the allure of candour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7189" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image19.png?resize=635%2C596" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image12.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7190" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image12.png?resize=635%2C607" alt="image12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like a charming, mature person, the ads are able to admit that the product isn’t ideal. VW have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>confidence in experience, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>teaches us that no one’s life is remotely ideal. You can honestly admit some problems and still be pretty good overall. The real virtues are still there, despite the drawbacks. In reality, we all accept this all the time. The job is far from perfect, but it’s still a decent place to work. The children’s school is far from perfect, but it does some things very well. And anyone seeking perfection in a partner is guaranteed to be miserable. But we get nervous around such obvious ideas when it comes to selling. The approach VW uses here is charming because it addresses us as the adults we really are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Incidentally, VW have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>themselves more recently become infatuated with Canova &#8211; unfortunately for the appeal of their advertising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image29.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7191" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image29.png?resize=635%2C449" alt="image29" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve become worried about the ordinary. They’ve been corrupted by the Romantic idea that to be good something has to be unusual. (Which is &#8211; ultimately &#8211; a tragic idea because it implies that we’re almost all bound to be unhappy, since by definition almost everyone’s life will be ordinary). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jaguar are making more upmarket cars; so it’s not really their vehicles they might be winningly modest about. It’s the drivers. Rather than fabricate an ideal, polished customer, they could be sweetly candid about the driver’s likely shortcomings. We’d suggest a campaign built around slogans of this kind: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your marriage is a bit of a disappointment, fortunately your car doesn’t have to be. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your performance is unreliable; Jaguar’s isn’t. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It’s lean, even if you’re not. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It will make you look more impressive than you actually are. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Driving a Jaguar is where life makes sense. Life is where it doesn’t. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The campaign is making friends with the potential customer by &#8211; like a real friend &#8211; liking them, while being perfectly aware of their imperfections. A friend doesn’t like you because they’ve failed to notice the ways you are considerably less than ideal. They appreciate your merits and and sympathise with your tribulations and weaknesses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The typical modern advert is <em>Romantic</em>. That is it adopts one of the key ideas of the Romantic Movement which dominated European and US culture in the 19th century and whose effects are still very much with us. Specifically, they buy into the conviction that only the special can be good. They associate the notion of being ordinary with failure and dreariness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/688px-George_Gordon_Byron_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7258" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/688px-George_Gordon_Byron_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_2.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="688px-George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_(2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><i>George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron</i>, by Richard Westall</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, the <em>Classical</em> vision of culture is interested in, and enthusiastic about, the good ordinary. The classical outlook is very keen that the average should be nice. It assumes that what is normal can also be great. The task isn’t to make sure that one focuses on what no one else has. Rather the real business of culture &#8211; and of commerce &#8211; is to make what is common also rather good. From the classical point of view, to brand a product as ‘exclusive’ is to admit defeat. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Idealisation is the enemy of the good ordinary. It is a problem that afflicts us not only in the marketplace, but in personal relationships too. So often in relationships we dream of how wonderful life could be, if only… And it leads us to under-rate the value of the more commonplace, but genuinely good things that are within our grasp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a kind of salesmanship that doesn’t only get better at tapping into our needs; but which &#8211; along the way &#8211; helps us recognise, and properly esteem, the worth of the life we are mainly required to live: an ordinary one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Underconfidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Japanese aesthetics manages to get excited about things which are, on first hearing about them, desperately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>unprepossessing. They talk enthusiastically about moss, drafts and &#8211; especially &#8211; broken pots.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7192" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of <em>kintsukuroi</em> &#8211; which means <em>more beautiful because it has been broken</em> &#8211; helps direct attention to an easily missed appeal. The Japanese enthusiasts are not pretending. The repaired pot really is beautiful. It’s just that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if you come to it with unhelpful preconceptions you’ll dismiss it out of hand –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and never get round to noticing its charm. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Concepts like ‘kintsukuroi’ are in the selling business. They’re not initially charging money for a product or a service, so it doesn’t look like selling. But Japanese aesthetics are selling in the more fundamental sense of persuading someone to appreciate and want something. And further down the line people will be willing to pay to have this sort of thing. So there’s a market in Japan for nicely repaired bowls &#8211; a branch of commerce that is not yet much evolved in Sydney or Manchester. And in Japan, the value of a property will be augmented by the fact that the little tea house in the tiny garden has especially good drafts that cause the paper scrolls to flutter in a way people (in suburban Yokohama) have come to find enchanting.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point isn’t that we should get interested in building up businesses supplying pre-smashed crockery or installing drafts in people’s homes. Rather, these case studies teach us a useful kind of confidence. Things that might easily be thought unworthy of appreciation can &#8211; if described in the right way &#8211; emerge as attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People who have learned how to sell broken pots and imperfect insulation might have something to teach us about marketing things we currently regard as ‘low’ and unworthy of much attention: air conditioning units, filing cabinets or cereal packets (which we’ll be looking at in more detail in section 5). </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The general thought, which we meet here repeatedly, is that good people panic around selling. They head too quickly to what they assume is the only thing the target audience will tolerate. If you speak about less familiar merits or demerits, you fear people won’t come on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t just apply to commercial situations. You might be going to get married and feel that you have to have a wedding with an elaborate dinner with seven courses when in truth you feel it would be lovely just to have cheese sandwiches and mini Twix bars &#8211; the wedding equivalent of a smashed pot. But you instantly dismiss this from your mind as ‘impossible’. People won’t get it. Your partner will object, the guests will be disappointed. What you are held up by is not something actually wrong with your idea. In fact, it could be an extremely happy occasion. And in reality &#8211; you feel sure &#8211; most people hardly notice what they’re eating on such occasions. You’ve got a good case, but you don’t make it because it feels too weird. We’re very scared of rejection. We’ve created a fragile social environment in which unless you boost, it will be rejected: unless you emphasise how elaborate the occasion will be you’ll look cheap or mean or antisocial. The people, actually very few of them, who do feel intently that weddings should be highly complicated have projected their attitude strongly, with desperate effectiveness. They’ve made it look as if this is the only plausible option. When it really isn’t.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us probably love a grandmother and a child &#8211; people who, almost inevitably, by the standards of the world are nothing terribly special, maybe a bit difficult or awkward in a hundred ways. We know how to do this: love imperfection with boundless enthusiasm, because we do it all the time. Inbuilt into life is a rich capacity to love what is imperfect, starting with our loved ones. But we lose confidence in this actually widespread capacity. We panic and forget that others actually can readily activate this side of themselves &#8211; and that this is in fact the task of selling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we miss the opportunities for ‘selling’ (speaking of the virtues of) things that many people might like &#8211; a sandwich at a wedding, a repaired pot, a beaten-up table, if only it were confidently offered. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Shouting</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At breakfast, you are confronted by a smallish portable billboard, which also doubles as a container for cereal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7193" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="picture 61989" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s quite a lot it wants to communicate &#8211; with the goal of getting us to drop a packet into the trolley next time we’re at the supermarket. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Their breakfast offering is going to charge into your life like a train rocketing towards you across the wheat fields of the Midwest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The product is bursting with energy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It’s filled with sunlight and big skies and made from perfect ears of corn. And you mustn’t forget its nutritional advantages either. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the box is worried. It’s anxious that you might not be paying proper attention. It imagines that the ambient noise at this moment is quite high &#8211; maybe you’re listening to news of a political scandal, perhaps you’re glancing at the weather forecast; maybe you’re coordinating the day with your partner or trying to think where your child’s Peppa Pig wellington boots could be hiding.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With all this competition around a Weetabix box wants to cut through and make you listen to what it has to say. And to do this it <em>shouts</em>. Weetabix uses the strongest colour contrasts, they ramp up the intensity: the sunrise is explosive; the sky is intensely blue; the wheat is perfectly golden;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the lettering is huge, they make point blank assertions of the virtues of their product. Every bit of the surface has been made use of to keep the volume as high as possible. If they could, they might fit flashing lights and a claxon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are other ways in which messages get across and win our attention in a crowded world. Shouting isn’t the only option: it’s just a very familiar one at the moment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An alternative to using a loud voice was explored by the English artist Ben Nicholson (1894–1982). He specialised in a very low-key, semi-abstract approach to scenes of everyday life. He wanted to dim the volume of what he was saying so much that others would have to turn down the ambient noise. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nicholas-tate_1246954i.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7194" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nicholas-tate_1246954i.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="nicholas-tate_1246954i" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Packaging for a breakfast-time product</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He muted the colours (he was very fond of light grey); he used delicate harmony and clear, simple shapes to impress us. He realised that &#8211; for all that’s going on around us &#8211; we’re actually very responsive to certain dim signals. Something can stand out from the crowd precisely because it is quiet. His works are very calm and self-possessed. It’s a quality we recognise and like in people. It’s the person who doesn’t have to raise their voice to be listened to, the speaker who can hold the attention of a room even though they speak without assertion and pause between sentences. They’re not mumbling or bashful. There’s a real, convincing, authority behind their words. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7195" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926.png?resize=635%2C584" alt="ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ben Nicholson had the confidence to know we could be charmed by a bowl of fruit on a modest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>table. We could warm to subdued tones. We could like the simple outlines and rapid hinting of shapes. Many people happily hang images like this on their walls at home: the average Ben Nicholson costs many millions now. Yet the designers working for Weetabix forget this side of us when they’re planning the look of their boxes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shouting gets attention, but it doesn’t persuade. It doesn’t change hearts and minds. We’re really seeking not just to get someone to notice us, but to understand and appreciate the point we’re making. We ideally want them to listen carefully. And for getting that result, Ben Nicholson offers a vital lesson. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. Cheeriness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Across history, the articulation of melancholy attitudes has won immense audiences &#8211; Keats, Baudelaire, Amy Winehouse and thousands of singers enchant us with their appreciation of the sorrows of existence. We’re deeply attracted to their ability to speak of the more sombre aspects of life: we love and get left; our hopes are routinely frustrated; people we need get ill, they die; so many lovely things are fleeting. Summer passes, a friend moves away, one’s hair thins.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult and that suffering and disappointment are core parts of universal experience. It’s not a disorder that needs to be cured. The good life is not one immune to sadness, but one in which suffering contributes to our development. Sometimes you feel sad and you can’t quite put your finger on why. It’s not one acute sorrow that’s eating you. You feel in a way the whole of life calls for tears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_5001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7222" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_5001.jpg?resize=500%2C530" alt="tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy sells</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet advertising almost always forgets this. It is relentlessly cheerful. There has hardly ever been a melancholy advert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-952391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7279" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-952391.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-95239" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re amazingly cheerful over here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling is mesmerised by the idea that when we feel a bit sad &#8211; when we’re touched by melancholy &#8211; what we need is to be at once very vigorously cheered up. It’s not a silly idea and sometimes it works. But by only using this approach the salesperson misses the opportunity to reach us in other ways. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The central move of melancholy art &#8211; in songs and poetry especially &#8211; is to comfort and help us by not trying to cheer us up. It’s a move we understand intuitively in the darker times of our own emotional lives. The sympathetic friend doesn’t pretend that all is well. They don’t say, it doesn’t matter that your parent has died, that you’ve been retrenched from work, that the novel you’ve been working on for seven years has been rejected for the 22nd time. They do us the honour of acknowledging our sadness and recognising that it is called for. In the darkness, they stretch out a hand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of not trying to cheer people up &#8211; but of offering another kind of kindness &#8211; was at the heart of the work of the French poet Charles Baudelaire (1821 – 1867). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7198" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="Étienne_Carjat,_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire,_circa_1862" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baudelaire was extremely well acquainted with grief. He had a miserable relationship with his socially prominent stepfather; he was addicted to gambling, he was infected with syphilis at an early age, he squandered his inheritance. He found the process of writing agonisingly difficult. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>To the reader,</em> he addresses us directly: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">— Hypocrite lecteur, — mon semblable, — mon frère!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which is to say, in effect: you my reader are a hypocrite, you are like me, you are my brother! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In calling us hypocrites, he’s not being insulting. He’s acknowledging that we often pretend &#8211; specifically, we pretend to be happier than we really are. He won’t be telling us that everything is going to be fine but he offers us his companionship, because he knows our troubles (and more) from the inside. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advertisers think they have to tell something cheerful &#8211; rather than, as is the truth, confirm the legitimacy of their true, sorrowful feelings. They’re forgetting to address us as mature people: individuals who can, with a little help, accept complexity and compromise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea isn’t that advertising &#8211; or selling more broadly &#8211; should undertake a volte face and always be melancholy. What we’re suggesting is that it could very usefully extend its emotional range. It could <em>sometimes</em> meet us in other moods.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9038266281_73834f2696_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7282" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9038266281_73834f2696_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="9038266281_73834f2696_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has big implications, because there are needs we’re more alive to when we feel a bit sad. We don’t stop being consumers when we’re down; but we have different priorities. One could project a financial services company that routinely demonstrated that it was in touch with our sorrows; or a gaming company that could pick up our interest in our melancholy times. There is a market for more modest, more down-beat products. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of a firm wanting to hire the best new recruits. The natural temptation is to be very cheery about working for the firm &#8211; everything is sunny, the work is fascinating, the team is shoulder-to-shoulder. But many of the most talented, resourceful and loyal potential staff will be complicated individuals. They’re less robotic, more realistic about themselves. To draw them to your firm, an admission of life’s sorrows (including the sorrows of work: ‘sometimes its disappointing and there are days when we all wonder if it’s really all worth it’) could be a crucial advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Inauthenticity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Salesmanship goes wrong when the seller comes across as inauthentic. They seem not quite a real person: too smooth, too slick or over-friendly (but not actually a friend). Their efforts to appeal &#8211; and to win the trust of the customer &#8211; backfire. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The product itself might actually be pretty good in many ways. It’s the effort to sell it that’s going wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4700653868_375c9f633e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7284" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4700653868_375c9f633e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="4700653868_375c9f633e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inauthenticity stems from mistaken assumptions about what other people want and what they are like. The seller moulds themselves to what they erroneously imagine the customer wants them to be. They adopt an attitude they don’t personally like in the hope of pleasing the client. It’s a wrong theory of what you would need to do to win other people over. And it tends not to work terribly well, because we’re all amazingly astute detectors of fake emotions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The management of a resort hotel might think: we should pretend to be servile to the clients &#8211; presumably that’s what <em>they</em> want even though we don’t like it when people do that to us. With the result that a family never goes back to a particular hotel on an island they love. They complain to their friends that the staff seemed plastic and a bit creepy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– An aspiring novelist feels: I’d best lace the story with references to luxury products and Bond-type violence, even though I personally find that a turn off, because that’s what sells isn’t it? The publishers turns down an otherwise promising manuscript. In the commissioning meeting, the book is rejected because it was felt to lack conviction.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A high-flying professor of economics is co-opted by a major political party to help sell their economic policies to the electorate. They clown around in an interview on Sunrise and come across as condescending. Some important ideas about the nation’s finances lose credibility and get put on the back-burner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A woman fears that her partner won’t stay with her unless she pretends to be more outdoorsy than she really is. She psyches herself up to seem enthusiastic about a camping trip. Eventually her misery become obvious and the relationship falls apart. Or, worse, she hates it but puts on a brave face. She ends up dreading every holiday for the next ten years and it ends in a bruising divorce.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A company wants to improve the calibre of recruits it</span> takes on, in view of a big expansion into new markets. They’re offering a competitive salary but feel they need to woo the very best candidates with an airbrushed vision of the firm’s character: it’s dynamic, thrilling, everyone’s great friends. Though they themselves know it’s not perfect but accept it for what it is: intermittently interesting, occasionally frustrating, riddled with normal workplace tensions &#8211; that is: much like other places. The interviewees they are most impressed by get the sense there’s something not quite right and turn down the job offers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person, service, product or employer on offer may have some real merits. But the selling fails because it’s not authentic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a very natural worry that leads one to this: in my heart of hearts I think that what I’ve got to offer is pretty good, if I were them I’d take it. But I fear that if I tell it like it is, they’ll reject it and me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inauthenticity is rooted in lack of confidence: specifically a lack of confidence in your own responses and desires and intuitions and an assumption that other people are very different from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>you.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our best source for understanding what people are going to like or cope with is, in fact, ourselves. How you like to be treated, what you enjoy eating or reading, what you accept as OK gives very good guidance to how other people are likely to respond. (Of course it’s not a 100% guarantee that everyone will share your response. But that’s never what’s needed. No company on earth can get &#8211; or realistically seek &#8211; every customer in a competitive market.) Weirdly, though, we tend not to take this information seriously. We don’t recognise its importance. We don’t let it govern our salesmanship. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>authentic</em> selling the seller trusts their own personal responses. They build on the idea that the Other is likely to be quite a lot like them. They come across as charming. You feel that someone is charming, not just because they’re being polite but for a bigger reason. You feel they’re intuitively in touch with your needs. For instance, they might quickly pick up on when you feel slightly awkward and deftly move to reassure you &#8211; even if it’s only with a sympathetic smile. What they’re doing in fact is using their own experience of feeling ill at ease to tune into what’s going on for you. They’re doing you the courtesy of thinking that since they’d feel awkward in your shoes, you’re probably feeling awkward too (though you’ve not explicitly let on). An air steward becomes charmless if (for example) they ignore their own experience of being occasionally baffled by technology and give you the impression they think you’re a bit of an idiot because you’re having trouble operating the entertainment system. They are assuming that they are not like you and opening up a gap which charm works to close.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm is a common factor in lots of good selling situations: good writing, a good lunch companion, good public speaking or producing good copy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 16th-century French philosopher Michel de Montaigne has a couple of things to teach us about charm. He took the classically leaden and chilly philosophical essay and delighted his contemporaries (and subsequent readers down the centuries) by transforming it into something engaging. He’s got serious things to say but he says them in a charming way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He acknowledges the fears of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s natural to get a bit anxious around intellectual matters; one is going to lose the thread, get bored or feel humiliated. Sometimes Montaigne is upfront about this. He’ll say, this is getting too complicated or this is starting to be tedious. But he acknowledges it in other ways too. He keep his chapters short.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He uses lots of concrete examples. He adds in jokes. He mocks people who are intellectually arrogant. All of these signal that he’s attuned to the secret worries we might have. He didn’t work this out by consulting a focus group. He knows we have these fears because he’s noticed them in himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He’s authentic &#8211; and charming &#8211; because he’s working from the belief that we’re pretty much like him and so he can trust his own feelings in our company.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Michel_de_Montaigne_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7298" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Michel_de_Montaigne_1-1.jpg?resize=690%2C358" alt="Michel_de_Montaigne_1 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He reveals things about himself that go beyond the so-called polite</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne is an unusual author because he’s ready to let down his guard and tell us things about himself that people tend to feel a bit ashamed of and to keep quiet about for fear of losing the good opinion of others. He recounts his bouts of impotence. He admits he farts quite a lot and that he has trouble with his bowel movements. He’s not <em>only</em> parading his vulnerabilities. He’s doing it because he knows it’s a way to get us to feel relaxed in his company. He’s demonstrating he’s like us &#8211; even though <em>unlike</em> us he knows a lot about Greek literature and the secret goings on of the diplomatic world. We’ll go with him on his travels through the world of ideas because he’s won our confidence with his candour. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne is showing us that the way to get good results is to acknowledge fears and frailties. In another context, it’s the way a great general gets the best out of his troops because he’s always showing that he knows what it feels like to be on the front line. It’s the senior manager who can good-humouredly fix a paper jam in the copying machine, and the teacher who is powerfully alive to what it’s like to be nine. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm is a graceful acknowledgement of our reality. The failure to make this acknowledgement &#8211; the shortfall in charm &#8211; explains what can go wrong in:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The half-empty stiff, posh restaurant</em>. The management hasn’t clearly enough identified what they themselves enjoy about elegance. So they’ve ended up creating a slightly pompous, frosty atmosphere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>An uninteresting novel</em>. The writer has read a lot of the big famous works. When Dickens takes a character into a house, he always gives an elaborate description. He doesn’t just say, &#8216;They went to Jim’s place.’ He says something like: ‘James O’Donnell (after his late and occasionally lamented mother) Merriweather &#8211; Jim to his confreres &#8211; was the fortunate denizen of a delicious set of rooms perched in the higher regions of one of the more recently constructed communal mansions of that portion of our capital officially designated as Battersea. They climbed the several flights of carpeted stairs and arrested themselves before a portal of average dimensions but distinguished by a curious knocker emblazoned with the word ‘SALVE’. With a self-conscious flourish Jim extracted from a pocket a simple key …’ Forgetting what they themselves are excited by as a reader, their own novel gets more elaborate, more dull. They forget to omit the uninteresting bit that they’re inclined to skip when reading. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Boring social evenings</em>. The conversation never quite takes off and people are cagey with each other. The hosts haven’t been able to home in on what they themselves are actually like &#8211; what they actually liked about the best parties they’ve been to. Probably they’ve picked up on incidentals. They went to a delightful dinner where (as it happened) they were serving Japanese food. When entertaining, they focus a lot of attention on the sushi. But though the fish was great, that wasn’t actually what made the evening they recall so special. It was actually the way the hostess introduced people to one another, the way the host unobtrusively steered the conversation into very interesting waters &#8211; these were the active ingredients. And our couple enjoyed them, but without quite realising it. And in giving their own parties, they don’t focus on the things that really make an evening work.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard for us to hold on to our common humanity. And it means that our efforts to sell (ideas, social companionship, tables in a restaurant) to other people get derailed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a typical sales strategy that tries to avoid acknowledgement of potential problems. It’s an instinctive move, built on an an underlying theory: if you mention the problem, it gets worse. But in selling, it’s a liability. Because the problem is going to emerge at some point. You’ll lose future sales, have disgruntled customers on your hands and discover there’s a popular Facebook page for people who feel they’ve been let down by you and want the world to know all about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm has a very distinctive attitude to problems. The charming person sees a problem as a potential bond &#8211; a shared difficulty. We pick up on it socially. They’re in the car with you and you struggle to get into a parking space (though it’s not really that small): they don’t look down on you. In a minute they’re telling you how they’re nervous of roundabouts and steep hills. The little indignities of driving become a private joke between you. Charm has a good attitude to mentioning problems, founded on the charming person’s readiness to see problems as a normal and interesting part of life. They know everything has its downsides. A problem isn’t fatal. So there’s more confidence in being upfront about defects.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm sells not because it is (as its detractors suggest) sleek and ingratiating. No one finds that charming. But because it grows out of self-knowledge and confidence in shared humanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. Bad Teaching</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling is often an attempt to teach the merits of a product or service (or of oneself) to another. So selling gets into trouble &#8211; that is, it gets less effective &#8211; when the seller is a bad teacher. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What actually makes someone a poor teacher? No one is deliberately setting out to fail to teach. But bad teaching is not inevitable. There’s a central error the ineffective teachers make. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The bad teacher has forgotten the fears of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can take a look at this happening in higher education. Philosophy departments typically want to get more students to attend courses. They want to grow their numbers. So they advertise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an advertisement for philosophy from Birkbeck College, which offers courses in central London in the evenings for adult learners &#8211; anyone can enrol. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Birkbeck1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7200" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Birkbeck1.png?resize=528%2C172" alt="Birkbeck" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The advert is written by people who know a lot about philosophy. They’re adept at constructing sophisticated theories. But they’re less good at handling some widespread fears around intellectual life. It could be boring. The class could be filled with awkward people. It could all be baffling. The promotional page doesn’t tune into the worries. It inadvertently enhances them. We’re now queasy at the thought of trying to identify ‘the nature of reality’ or daunted by the prospect of ‘dealing with fundamental questions in a rigorous way’ (one may end up dealing with them in a sloppy way and get humiliated). The bad teacher is impatient with the fears we have. They blame us for having them. Which does nothing to bring people in or help anyone to learn. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are lots of areas which fail to appreciate widespread fears and reluctance in the modern economy: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-548855307.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7201" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-548855307.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="woman using dental floss to clean her teeth" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Flossing products tend to stress the positives: look at how lovely your teeth will be when you’ve been flossing regularly for a long time. You could be like her. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve neglected a set of anxieties that in fact get in the way of more people buying their product and getting on with the job. One feels: I’ll get bored, it’s depressing looking at my very imperfect teeth in the bathroom mirror; it’s too fiddly. We don’t take pride in these negative feelings, but we have them. The advert aggravates them by showing us someone who seems to be great because they are entirely free of our troubles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They could develop some adverts using people with these fears: a spotty teenager looking blearily into the mirror and swearing every time the floss slips and cursing the red marks on their thumb where the thread has been pulled too tight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or there’s the macho sportswear manufacturer who has forgotten the fears people have around sport. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adidas-Wariner1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7202" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adidas-Wariner1.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="Adidas-Wariner1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>They</em> love rugged athleticism, they’re keen on pushing themselves; they enjoy the banter of the locker room. But most people aren’t like this. Mostly we’re pretty anxious around sport. We don’t win. We’re not very fit and we’re intimidated by those who excel. So the advert ends up sending us the message that the product (and the whole area of life it is related to) isn’t for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad teaching is a commercial problem for the seller: they aren’t reaching a segment of their potential market. But it’s also a loss for us &#8211; the consumers whose fears are ignored and cast as embarrassing. Because what these companies are selling isn’t just floss or running shoes. It’s healthy gums and confident enjoyment of exercise. And these are things we need in our lives. They’re making it harder for us to live well because they increase our anxieties (or at least don’t calm them down) around things that would actually be good for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The good teacher is onto the fears and resistance of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we’ve seen, any product or service has around it fears that are holding back growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fears could include the worry that something is: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too intellectual:<em> I can’t purchase that book, see myself reading that newspaper</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too rugged: <em>I can’t buy a tent</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too technical: <em>I can’t have that coffee machine in my life</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too feminist:<em> I can’t watch this comedy show</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too sexist: <em>I can’t buy this car</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too Brazilian: <em>I can’t join that dancing class, work for that firm</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too American: <em>I can’t go to that restaurant chain</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good teachers (and sellers) don’t say: you shouldn’t have this fear. They don’t send out signals that only inadequate people have worries like these. They don’t stay quiet about them. Instead, they take them by the horns. They acknowledge where people are starting from and work from there. They don’t feel that acknowledging a fear is the same as endorsing it. They believe that acknowledging a fear is a key moment in a process of overcoming it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Sir Humphry Davy</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(1778 – 1829) was one of the great scientists of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7203" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="Sir_Humphry_Davy,_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Admired by his scientific peers for proving that oxymuriatic acid does not contain oxygen</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was a very serious man. He was a pioneer of electrolysis. He helped discover the elements barium and boron. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Davy was also very ambitious for the contribution science could make to our lives (he invented a special lamp for miners to use underground)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and he wanted to see a society where scientific understanding was widespread, not reserved for a few specialists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He became very popular for the talks he gave around the UK. He was brilliant at drawing people in. In his public lectures lectures, he always had lots of explosions, smells and clouds of steam &#8211; he loved making jokes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7204" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He realised that a key fear of the audience is: it will be too serious. He didn’t feel that science is so important and serious, it is above fun. He realised that it has to be fun if a lot of people are going to engage with it. He didn’t look down on people because they were nervous around complicated things. He realised he could make some moves that would disarm these anxieties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Jamie Oliver</em> realises that for a lot of men there’s a fear around cooking certain things: it will be too feminine. There’s a powerful subterranean worry that you can’t be a proper man and cook asparagus and mint risotto. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lrg_3569.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7205" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lrg_3569.jpg?resize=635%2C288" alt="lrg_3569" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Jamie Oliver</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Oliver never gives the impression that it’s stupid or low to have this anxiety. He makes a great play of being blokey and doing some things which social tradition has made feel unavailable to key groups of people. He’s turned addressing this fear into a career. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What distinguishes these great teachers is the way they view the fears of the audience. They don’t get angry or annoyed. They don’t blame people. They are unthreatened by the fact that someone has some worries. Because they don’t see a fear as the end of the story. They know that fears &#8211; if treated nicely &#8211; can be disarmed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. Badgering </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling goes wrong when it pesters people. And unfortunately, a lot of selling and advertising is annoying. It turns up at awkward times and in places where it’s not wanted. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You get out of the shower to answer the doorbell &#8211; it’s people selling an animal charity. Or, your computer is bunged up with pop-ups. Every day you encounter thousands of promotions for products you don’t need and will never buy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t with the products. The burgers could be fine, the charity is deserving, the agents might work round the clock in the interests of their clients. The things you don’t need might be exactly what another person requires. The problem isn’t selling as such. It’s trying to sell to the wrong person at the wrong time. Badgering has two characteristics: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Randomness</em>: they’re assaulting the whole world because they’re not sure how to reach their real audience </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Untimeliness</em>: they’ve not managed to get you at the point when you’re receptive</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7308" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Laura Cummings</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a version of badgering in relationships: <em>nagging</em>. The aim might be really very reasonable &#8211; this person should take out the rubbish or clean their room. But the approach isn’t helpful: repetition of the demand at inopportune moments and lack of insight into how to motivate this person to do what you want. Nagging is sadly liable to make compliance less likely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In love, badgering gives us the stalker. It’s the person who knows they are keen on someone but has no view of why the other should be interested in them. They have no seductive resources and simply impose themselves in a deeply unpleasant manner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering is commercially counterproductive. It’s a poor selling strategy because the annoying methods turn many potential customers off the products. It might get you a little bit of acquiescence, but you lose goodwill. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Why sellers end up badgering </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few reasons companies end up badgering the public: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The age of the internet</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By reducing the cost of getting at people, technology encourages randomness: you can bother tons of people, even if you only end up getting one or two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5224107005_822633d4db_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7310" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5224107005_822633d4db_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5224107005_822633d4db_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Tom Hickmore</h6>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Lack of empathy with the customer</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering grows from an unflattering &#8211; and mistaken &#8211; picture of the customer. It supposes </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the customer can only respond to loud noises</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- can be won over by sheer repetition</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- will readily respond to vulgar signals…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t how the sellers themselves feel and behave. They don’t like being pestered. But they don’t think of their audience as being basically quite like them in this respect. They lose touch with their own experience when devising their selling strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4523440002_4e37d583f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7312" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4523440002_4e37d583f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="4523440002_4e37d583f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Minimal customer information</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an approach that suggests the seller doesn’t know the customer’s needs and aren’t very interested in finding out more: if you knew anything about me, you wouldn’t be trying to reach me this way. Maybe I could be persuaded &#8211; just not the way you’re going about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Low self-esteem around the product</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving the impression that you are trying to force a desire (and a product) on the customer &#8211; suggests you don’t really feel that you have anything genuine to offer. It suggests that the seller doesn’t quite believe that the product would, on its own merits, be wanted.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Growing out of Nagging</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering people, and nagging, are natural strategies for gaining attention. We used them as babies, when we had no other options. A baby’s wail makes the carer respond, even if they don’t want to &#8211; just to get some peace and quiet. The six-year-old has no capacity to rationally persuade his parents to buy him a goldfish but will instinctively assume that asking a million times will work (and occasionally it does).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This is where we all have come from. We carry a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lot of residue. And when we’re under pressure when stressed, we return to these early instincts.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path of growth towards adulthood involves getting better at three things: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Greater awareness of who you are talking to and their needs</em>. The badgering child doesn’t really understand why the parent won’t agree. The child thinks: maybe they’ve forgotten (in the last three minutes) so I’ll ask again. Good growth here means getting more aware of what the parent’s reservations might actually be. The art of persuasion evolves via working out how to address the worries. So at fourteen, the child might be drawing up a little document called: why I should be allowed to go on the school trip to Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry one: it would be too expensive. But you wouldn’t have to feed me for three weeks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry two: I didn’t get a good grade in German last term. But that’s because I don’t see the point of learning a language I don’t need to use. Going to Berlin would change that. It would motivate me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry three: You think I’ll get homesick. Remember I was fine when I stayed with granny for a week when you went to Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Getting more sensitive to the context</em>. The child might learn that their aunt’s rather luxurious flat is not a good place to ask their parents for anything, because that place tends to make them feel anxious about money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7301109350_2507ff1f1c_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7330" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7301109350_2507ff1f1c_o.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="7301109350_2507ff1f1c_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Timeliness</em>. They know that their mother is very likely to listen carefully at 3.00pm on Sunday, and not at all at 7.45 am on Monday. Or that the drive home from school is the ideal time to make a big request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same three points apply equally in commercial selling: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Finding out more about the potential customer</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more I can allow myself to find out about the customer, the less I’m inclined to badger or nag. This means getting a more accurate, insightful picture of their concerns and needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The ideal of commerce is that it is delivering on the needs a person truly has &#8211; even on ones they don’t at first fully recognise they have. It might be actually a great contribution to someone’s life to take a trip to the Colorado desert; or make a career shift or buy a ten-seater dining table (though at yet such needs haven’t crystallised in their mind). A friend might see these things. The friend could recognise the need on the basis of understanding the person’s life. That doesn’t mean tracking that they’ve just purchased some toothpaste or that they&#8217;ve watched six episodes of <em>House of Cards</em> on Netflix last week. Rather, the friend can see what’s happening in this individual’s life: how they are getting sucked into preoccupation with status (hence the merits of the desert &#8211; where status doesn’t count); or there’s a level of cynicism about work building up, that’s probably connected to the industry they are working in; or they could do with improving relations with their extended family &#8211; but on their own terms. Getting them a big table regularly &#8211; like their parents used to do &#8211; would be a great help.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/8571187232_b2124d755c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7331" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/8571187232_b2124d755c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8571187232_b2124d755c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get to this level of insight would require building up a huge amount of trust between the seller and the potential customer. At the moment, selling is fragmented. You buy different things from different people. You might trust them in one area (they are excellent at supplying children’s T-shirts, or a reliable place to book flights) but it doesn’t extend to offering these suppliers a portrait of you as a person. Yet in principle, there’s a huge benefit for the customer. The supplier acts as their friend, in their best interests, grounded in real understanding of their best interests and needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Sensitivity to the context</em>. A hamburger doesn’t go well with a ploughed field. Everyone’s slightly aware that a hamburger might not be the most natural thing in the world. And you might not want to advertise a luxury handbag anywhere near a bank. Context foregrounds certain aspects of your mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Timeliness</em>. This means understanding when a person is in the right mood to be receptive to the sales pitch. It’s not exploitation. It’s realising that there are times when we’re more alive to important truths and grasping that at other times we may be very annoyed if we’re addressed on certain matters. (Everyone recognises this in their own life).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2687999331_209904f9f1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7332" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2687999331_209904f9f1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C468" alt="2687999331_209904f9f1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might genuinely be wise for an individual to sign up for an exercise program or have a body scan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But quite probably, they are very resistant to thinking about these things. There might just be a few times in a year when they are able to look squarely at this genuine need. Getting them at such a point (with a sincere and decent offer) means engaging with their own better, but often hidden, nature. You are doing them a huge service if you can discover a good moment at which to raise a tricky topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves all build on the same underlying point: a higher quality of relationship between the seller and the potential buyer than is currently familiar. Badgering is the polar opposite. Trust arises when the seller is seeking to make a profit only from making a valuable contribution to the customer’s life. We could imagine a commercial utopia in which this was standard practice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. Fear of Success</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling can go wrong for many people because they are afraid of success. To sell would be to succeed and this makes them anxious. So they end up avoiding selling or bungling the opportunities. It’s a problem that can sound unlikely. Because we sometimes assume that everyone is keen to succeed. Being afraid of succeeding sounds strange. But it happens quite a lot: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been asked to make a presentation to a large and important audience. You feel terrified. You can’t sleep and try to think of ways of getting out of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>You fantasise about coming down with the flu the day before. In the end you have to do it. The presentation is a bit leaden. You get tongue-tied and confused when a key potential client asks a question.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An external contractor on a major project keeps pushing things in a direction you think isn’t quite right. But you find it very difficult to rein them in. It’s going over-budget, it’s not really what your firm needs. But you find it very hard to insist. The contractor is the specialist, they’ve got a lot of prestige in the industry. You don’t sell your ideas. You back down, even though you know you are right. It’s a nightmare. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling ‘you shouldn’t put your head above the parapet, it’s asking for trouble’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Causes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear of success is a problem. But it is an understandable one: there are three reasons why it can end up looking dangerous to succeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Fear of competition</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I am not competing with the alphas &#8211; so they won’t see me as a target worth attacking&#8230;’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I keep a low profile, they’ll ignore me, I’ll be safe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">A worry about provoking envy</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s always a lot of envy circulating in the world. But being envied is (close up) a very unpleasant experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s not like admiration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, to ward this off, one keeps one’s light under a bushel (one has come, unfortunately, to confuse success with boasting, arrogance, being smug.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Performance anxiety</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I say I can do something and then it turns out I can’t, the women in the hall will laugh, I’ll get mocked in the pub. The consequences of trying and failing seem so risky, that on balance it feels prudent not to try at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fixes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Dignifying the problem</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear of success is a problem that can afflict capable people &#8211; and those you’d maybe least expect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-544748195.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7225" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-544748195.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="General Eisenhower And Harold Macmillan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, was deeply affected by fear of success. He looked sure of himself; he could come across as smug. But he was terrified that his mentors &#8211; Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden &#8211; would see him as a threat and either abandon or humiliate him. He was always physically sick before making a speech in the House of Commons. In 1945 he had the support of a majority of Conservative MPs to run for leadership of the party. But he held back because it would have meant confronting those two men. It was twelve years before he finally took over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The French painter Henri Matisse eventually became loved around the world for his free, joyful style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Matissedance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7209" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Matissedance.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="640px-Matissedance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he didn’t start out working like that. For years he was gripped by fear of success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/not-identified.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7210" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/not-identified.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="not-identified" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He worked in a deeply conventional way that gave no hint of his own character or preferences. He was inhibited by the anxiety that if he succeeded &#8211; if he produced the work he really wanted to &#8211; he would be criticised, especially by his own father who was a dour disciplinarian. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Examples like this remind us that fear of success is an honourable problem. They reduce panic and make it easier to admit one has this issue &#8211; which is a key step in addressing it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Understanding where the fear has come from</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fear of success may have been acquired in unfortunate past environments where success really could be dangerous. You may have been in a school where people actually could get attacked by their classmates for doing too well in a test. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might have grown up around an older brother who would react very aggressively if you ever seemed to be better at anything than him. If it looked like you might win at Monopoly, he’d kick the board over. If you were running faster than him, he’d trip you up.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An insecure father might endlessly tell stories of back-stabbing, betrayal, of how good people &#8211; like him &#8211; always get done over by the bad guys. At a young age this picture of the world (in which success is equated with scurrility) that gets lodged deep in your brain. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fear was learned in particular past contexts; but the mind hasn’t quite caught up that in fact that your situation has changed; it’s following an old, tenacious pattern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding where the fear has started allows one to see that it doesn’t apply anymore. It may take many reminders of this to start to shift the pattern of thinking and feeling and make it more appropriate to where one is today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Looking very carefully at the imagined danger</em>: making oneself get serious and logical about the fear. What exactly do I think would happen if the presentation went well, if I insisted on my idea, if I sold a huge project to this client? One tries to visualise it in detail. Who does one fear would actually get upset. What might they do and say? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then each element is carefully unpacked. What evidence do I actually have that people would react like that? don’t just ask the question. Write down a detailed answer. Use specific names, dates, describe the circumstances. Would Xavier actually feel slighted. How do I know this? If he did feel slighted, what problems would this actually bring? Could he block my career? If he wanted to sabotage the project, could he actually accomplish that? Could he reduce my salary package? If he tried who could I turn to? If the presentation went well, how would Paul, Fleur and Cassie actually react? Did they react badly when Tammy gave that excellent presentation on the Singapore market? Why would it be different for me? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">11. Resistance to Learning</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling can go wrong, because the seller is resistant to learning. We tend not to notice we have this problem, because we assume we like learning. We do. But the issue is about the kinds of things we might need to learn and our attitude to learning those particular things. We tend to have quite a restricted idea of <em>what is learnable</em>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7211" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images.jpg?resize=182%2C277" alt="images" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dale Carnegie’s 1936 bestseller <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> can easily provoke a negative reaction. One builds up a picture of someone cynically pretending to be friendly (when really they are not your friend at all). And of setting out to take advantage of you by following a few dark rules of the art of manipulating people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We resist the notion that being warm, kind or charming are things that can be taught or learned. We’ve fallen prey to a Romantic belief that if it’s good, it can’t be learned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">William Wordsworth &#8211; the leading figure of the Romantic Movement in England &#8211; defined poetry as ‘the spontaneous overflow of of powerful emotion.’ He was setting up an ideal that wasn’t meant to be confined to people writing sonnets. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/William_Wordsworth_0011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7213" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/William_Wordsworth_0011.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="NPG 1857,William Wordsworth,by Benjamin Robert Haydon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was promoting a general idea about how we should live. We should honour instinct and give the prestige to everything natural. Following rules and hiding your feelings were looked on with horror. It was an attitude deeply opposed to deliberately working out how to get someone to like you or studying how to influence. Wordsworth was a pioneer with his outlook, but he eventually had huge influence. And today<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it feels unfamiliar &#8211; and a bit sinister &#8211; to suggest that anything very personal could be learned. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fixes </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aristocratic culture used to pay great attention to learning a wide range of things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7214" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="FdeTroyLectureMoliere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might profitably learn how to stand behind a chair, how to have a conversation, how to hold a book, how loud to laugh, how to be witty, how to flirt and how to say no without giving offence. They took the view that our natural instincts could be improved by training and education. We may not need to learn precisely those things. It’s the more general attitude that matters: lots of little things can be learned and if you learn them it makes you nicer for other people to be around. It helps you succeed in the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their view of what you might need to learn &#8211; can seem strange to us. But they were actually just continuing the long-running classical approach to education. That’s the view that the task of education is to improve nature. It takes as a starting point that we are not by nature well equipped to do all the things we need to. The classic approach took inspiration from tools and implements and all the technology they knew. They were particularly impressed by pulleys. </span></p>

Likewise, they reasoned, by nature we were not usually very adept at forming friendships, or explaining ourselves, or meeting strangers or telling anecdotes, or getting people to agree with us.

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION: The dawn of capitalism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Driving in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>taxi through Times Square at night, one might be mesmerised by the power of selling. A vast quantity of effort and ambition has been focused here. The entire square and (it feels) the sky is glowing with an urgent longing to entice us into buying a watch or a hamburger. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1_times_square_night_2013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7217" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1_times_square_night_2013.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="1_times_square_night_2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But not everyone is impressed. There might be a visitor from Europe who gets a bit annoyed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by place. The sight of all these luminous adverts irritates them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re not alone. They’re expressing a widespread attitude. Commerce, advertising and selling may be an unavoidable part of life, but it’s a low part. And the bigger and more powerful it gets (and in Times Square it seems very powerful indeed) the more it drags a whole society down: how can I be an honourable person in a society like this? This visitor can get very gloomy. They think wistfully of Chartres Cathedral, which they fondly remember visiting a few years ago. It’s also famous for light and colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7218" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière.jpeg?resize=635%2C582" alt="Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They complain that Times Square is just commercial: it’s all about selling stuff. They see it as a sign of the failure of the modern world: in the past people built noble temples, here everything is business. It’s disgusting. Selling, they feel, is the root of the problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this can’t be right. Because Chartres Cathedral was, in fact, a huge, highly elaborate, machine for selling. Amongst its more prominent advertising spaces are the round windows (which have been described as a crowning glory of French Culture).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>An advert for the dignity of manual labour:</strong> threshing the corn can be boring, but Chartres is selling a consoling and accurate idea of it’s honourable place in the life of the community (which one is otherwise liable to lose sight of). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7220" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An advert for maternal kindness</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chartres was selling too: just at a more ambitious level. The Catholic Church was a corporation trading in ideas and experiences concerning forgiveness, love, duty, admitting one’s faults, being listened to and having one’s hidden merits appreciated. The Church wasn’t doing this simply in order to make money &#8211; these were its foundational convictions. But it was rewarded financially on a grand scale for supplying them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference between Times Square and Chartres Cathedral isn’t to do with selling in itself. Both are devoted to selling. The difference is to do with WHAT is being advertised and sold. Times Square is selling chocolate, beer, cars, hamburgers and soft drinks. While Chartres Cathedral has a more elevated set of goods and services on offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re still at the dawn of capitalism. We can imagine Times Square in the future selling the important things: cures for loneliness, aids to forgiveness, things that help us be wise and kind. We don’t have to stop being devoted to advertising and commerce: we just need to engage with our higher needs and learn to profit from them. </span></p>

<p>The idea that work might be fulfilling rather than just painfully necessary is a strikingly recent invention. Nowadays, in the prosperous world, we don&#8217;t only expect to obtain money through labour, we also, to a greater or lesser extent, expect to find meaning and satisfaction. It&#8217;s a big ask and explains why so many of us have career crises.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is in love with entrepreneurship. Starting your own business holds the same sort of prestigious position as, in previous ages, making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem or spearing multiple enemies in battle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1557" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/127481498.jpg" alt="A Celebration Of Music Hosted By Sean Parker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© WireImage</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur remains maddeningly elusive. Governments and public bodies do their best to encourage people by helping out with the practicalities: offering tax breaks, making failure less punitive, setting up ‘enterprise zones’ and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet at the kernel of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract: <i>an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness.</i> Every morally-minded business is in some way alleviating a particular kind of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1558" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/135370827.jpg" alt="Apple's New Store In Grand Central Station Opens To Public" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because consumer society is now well-developed, it can be easy to think that everything must surely already have been done to please and satiate the audience, that every possible gimmick and thrill has been amply explored and indeed that we have far ‘too much stuff’ already. These concerns may then meld with an ecological concern for the diminishing resources of the planet – to create a view that we should henceforth aim for less and that capitalism is done for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the theory that we have in some way come to the end of the road of entrepreneurial innovation, that everything has already been done, is conceptually impossible. The clearest evidence for this claim is that we are, most of us, still very unhappy in all sorts of fascinating (and in this context, inspiring) ways. Cheeringly for the entrepreneurial among us, the frustrations, irritations and griefs of the present are an inexhaustible source of raw materials out of which the businesses of the future can be built.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1559" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/143134495.jpg" alt="Dove Kicks Off National &quot;Show Us Your Skin&quot; Campaign In New York City" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get a measure of just how many new businesses still have to be invented – and therefore how much further capitalism has to develop – we need only take an average day and focus on how much annoys us and how much satisfies us from the moment we wake up to the time we fall back to sleep. Areas where we are fairly happy are those where further developments seem unnecessary. The market is evidently saturated and new entrants will face high degrees of competition that will only depress wages and profitability for all the players; while areas of dissatisfaction are, in essence, zones of unexplored opportunity. The greater the unhappiness, the bigger the potential market.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s imagine diary entries logging things it’s easy to feel quite happy about in a typical day:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Breakfast cereal: a huge choice, many of them very nice. Even the healthy ones have become satisfying as well as nutritious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Mobile phones: one gets clear reception, and is connected to a distant continent in a heartbeat. Things are working well here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Coffee: yet another outlet has opened nearby. The milk is perfect, the beans subtle and beguiling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Clothes: 32 different kinds of T-shirt are being offered at very reasonable prices. All the possibilities and permutations in this area have been explored.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1560" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/166205081.jpg" alt="Inside Fast Retailing's Uniqlo Store Ahead Of Earnings" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s plenty more to frustrate and depress us at other points in a typical day:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- An argument with one’s partner: it’s hard to know quite what is going on. This is the third this week. Why is it so hard to live together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Anxiety on the way into work: is one’s career on track, what is one doing this for, what happened to one’s youthful promise?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Children complaining about homework again: bored and listless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Disgusting new block of flats going up at the end of the road: who did this? And why are they going to be so expensive?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1561" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/137249711.jpg" alt="London 2012 - Districts Of London - Stratford" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Beautiful restaurant but conversation with client sagging and dull. Why is it so hard to know what to talk about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Hard to calm down in the evening. Best to get a little drunk and check Twitter – a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One could go on; our griefs and irritations might fill dozens of pages, but already from the briefest sketch, one can discern the shape of some significant new businesses that might be pioneered in the future. For example: <i>a therapeutic service</i> to help couples in crisis. Given the importance of relationships compared with the relatively minor role occupied by luxury transport, if built properly, the business should theoretically exceed the revenues of BMW or Audi in a short time. <i>A career counselling service</i> would be just as necessary, one that worked properly, that was pleasant to visit, intelligently delivered, based on real science and that aimed to deliver clients with a vision of how to unite their talent with the needs of the world. <i>A new kind of school</i>: ideally, this would work back from the real problems of life in order to teach people things they actually needed to know, rather than forcing them through arcane scholastic exercises. <i>A property development firm</i> that accepted profits of 3% p.a (rather than the usual 15%+) and that set out to build efficient, beautiful houses for everyone. <i>A mobile phone app </i>designed to teach people how to have better conversations – rather than merely allowing them to have further conversations of the uninspiring kind they already have. <i>A new kind of monastery</i>, without religion, offering calm and retreat to those ground down by the tempests of modern life…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5757816075_7d07b0fb47_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7840" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5757816075_7d07b0fb47_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5757816075_7d07b0fb47_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everywhere one looks, there are frustrations and every one of them is – in theory – the seed of an enterprise. A first step towards entrepreneurship is hence to learn to study one’s own unhappiness, to register all one’s pulses of distress, however minor. Declining profits are in essence merely symptoms of giant failures of the imagination on the part of the business community: too many people throwing themselves at the same area, because they can’t think of anything more innovative to do than to start yet another airline, mobile phone company or supermarket chain – to the distress of all participants. By contrast, healthy profits are a reward for understanding and mastering a given human need ahead of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideas are not, of course, enough. There always comes the need to take care of practicalities and money; the requirement to raise bank loans, convince investors and find partners. But none of these practical steps stand any chance of working out if the original, psychological insight isn’t sound. And by the same token, if the insight is razor sharp, truly tailored to human functioning, then however arduous the journey, the business will stand a high chance of benefiting humanity and throwing off a little money too.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Arts graduates across the developed world complain bitterly about the difficulties they are facing finding employment. They spend long and costly years studying such subjects as history, art, philosophy, poetry and drama – then they reach the jobs market, and discover that no one has any use for their distinctive skills and interests. If they’re extremely lucky, they may find some kind of job, but it will almost certainly have no connection with what they studied or pay very much. A great number end up making coffee while deeply resenting – against the backdrop of frothing milk and roasting beans – how their years studying Foucault or Herodotus seem to have gone absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is tempting to dismiss such moans: if someone wants to spend their time finding out about post-colonial theory, reading South American novels or deconstructing vampire films, then that’s very nice – as a hobby. But it’s harder to see why anyone should expect to get paid for doing so. You don’t get paid for going to the cinema or attending parties either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, the extraordinary rate of unemployment – or misemployment – of graduates in the humanities is a sign of something grievously wrong with modern societies and their university systems. It’s evidence that we have no real clue what the humanities, including culture and art, are really for. We pay them a certain amount of lip-service, we like to declare them worthy and noble and fund a few professors to dig away in their archives, but basically, as societies, we don’t know what the humanities could do for us and therefore, how people trained in them should spend their days other than in preparing Frappuccinos.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2140" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateA.jpg" alt="Earns Starbucks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© PA Ted S. Warren/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Seemingly the only option after three years studying post-colonial theory or the poetry of Lucretius</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem lies squarely with the universities. If you ask these universities why young people should bother to study history or literature, they can’t give a straight answer. Fearing that they cannot compete effectively against practical departments like physics or computer science, faculties in the humanities take refuge in ambiguity and silence, having carefully calculated that they retain just enough prestige to get away with leaving the reasons for their existence somewhat murky. Instead, they make their students perform a range of deeply arcane manoeuvres. For example, a BA in philosophy at the university of Oxford currently requires you to achieve familiarity with metaphysics (substance, individuation, universals) and to do a thesis on concepts of intentionality in Quine, Frege or Putnam. An equivalent degree in English literature is awarded to those who can successfully tackle The Waste Land on allegorical and anagogic levels and trace the influence of Seneca’s dramatic theories on the development of Jacobean theatre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2142" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/OJO Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">This stuff could change your life – if it was taught in the right way</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This represents a gross neglect of what the humanities are really for: they are for helping us to live and to die. The humanities are the closest things we have to a replacement for religion. They are a storehouse of vitally important knowledge about how to lead our lives: novels teach us about relationships, works of art reframe our perspectives, drama provides us with cathartic experiences, history is a catalogue of case-studies into any number of personal and political scenarios. Like the religions of old, culture is there to have a therapeutic effect on us; which is why it matters so much in a troubled world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in order to bring out this therapeutic effect, we need to reinvent universities. Departments like ‘history’ and ‘literature’ operate under superficial categories which don’t throw the spotlight on the important aspects of the material they are dealing with. So in the redesigned universities of the future, there would be a Department for Relationships, an Institute of Dying and a Centre for Self-Knowledge. There would be centres of expertise on changing jobs and improving bonds with children, reconnecting with nature and facing illness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2145" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateE.jpg" alt="PM-270214-graduateE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">A future Department for Relationships, where literature would be assigned to therapeutic ends</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One would still study novels, histories, plays, psychoanalysis and paintings, but one would do so for explicitly therapeutic ends. So Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary would be assigned in a course on ‘How to manage the tensions of marriage’ instead of belonging in a course on ‘Trends in nineteenth-century fiction’, just as the works of Epicurus and Seneca would appear in a course on ‘How to Die’ rather than in one on ‘Hellenistic philosophy’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One would witness a surge in demand from the population at large for the services of people trained in culture in this new way – given that no one currently knows how to run a relationship, everyone is confused about bringing up kids, few of us have a clue how to manage our anxieties and death is universally terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unemployment of arts graduates is shameful and unnecessary because culture has answers and highly useful consolations to the urgent dilemmas of real people. We just need to get these insights out, package them properly, and commercialise them adequately, so that the armies of people currently serving coffee can put their minds to proper use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We aren’t creatures who need only practical things like food and drink, cement and running shoes. We also desperately crave nourishment for what we might as well, with no superficial associations, call our souls. This soul-related work should become a huge and legitimate part of the world economy, worth as many billions as the cement trade.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2147" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateD.jpg" alt="Europe-Trading in Pollution" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Peter Dejong/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Figuring out how to end a relationship could be just as big a business</span></h5>
<p class="p2">The sooner we get clear about what culture is for, and learn to use it as it was intended to be by its creators, the sooner we’ll start to view arts graduates as being no less useful than their colleagues in computer science or accountancy – and the sooner they’ll have other options beyond the coffee counter.</p>
