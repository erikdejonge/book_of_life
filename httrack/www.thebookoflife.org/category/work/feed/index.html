				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly, we like to think we are becoming a less macho society. But this style of behaviour remains a problem in the workplace: an overbearing, insensitive boss; a bullying colleague; a manager who never accepts any reasons why a project may run into difficulties; a client seems to take satisfaction delivering negative feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machismo has never been very nice. But that’s not the real issue. The problem is it is an ineffective way of managing working relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9888" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it wasn’t always like this. Machismo has its roots in ways of behaving that in the past seemed reasonable. For a long time, machismo was an effective strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving brusque commands makes perfect sense in some situations. It’s a very good way to get people to turn a boat swiftly starboard, push coal trolleys faster, or increase the rate of production at the blast furnace in a steel mill. When these were the primary forms of work, it was helpful to lead this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it makes sense to deny vulnerability when having doubts and second thoughts carries no advantage. Far back, the warrior needed to be fully protected; a chink in the armour was all it took to meet your end; fierceness was a key asset.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9873" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.png?resize=550%2C310" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">When it’s very easy to get a serious flesh wound, you have to wear a lot of armour and act fierce</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You didn’t actually need to be nice to people. A worker could feel underappreciated or bullied but still be able to perform their required task. Around physical work, emotional distress didn’t hold things up.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9874" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.jpg?resize=635%2C304" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">You could still operate the brick making machine at maximum speed, even if you hated your boss</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, unhappy workers didn’t usually have the option of changing jobs. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9875" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.jpg?resize=635%2C319" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the head gardener had a bit of a macho streak, the men digging the vegetables, watering in the greenhouses, or pruning in the orchard had few alternative kinds of work available to them. They couldn’t just get up and leave because they found the workplace oppressive. </span></p>
<p>Today the world of work is very different. A lot of work now involves careful attention to detail, sustained concentration, being a bit creative, thinking strategically. We’re working with our minds, and so we get very susceptible to the emotional atmosphere. We need respect, recognition and encouragement in order to do our best.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5998141526_8c65edecfb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9886" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5998141526_8c65edecfb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="HA0521 - Bedford staff and M1. A set of images  of HA staff in the Bedford office and new section of M1, north of junction 9. March 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barked commands and rough treatment are now counterproductive. A wounding comment from a supervisor will drag an accounts manager down all day &#8211; and clients notice even if the boss doesn’t. </span></p>
<p>And people can change jobs more easily. If you upset someone they can go across town, across the world or work for the competition. You’ve lost their talent and they’ll probably never tell you why.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7441249762_1abd945234_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9884" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7441249762_1abd945234_z.jpg?resize=635%2C447" alt="7441249762_1abd945234_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the very things that make employees valuable&#8211;sensitivity, ambition, confidence, independence&#8211;also make them likely to leave when they come up against macho behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the best out of people around work is a delicate and complex task &#8211; and one of the most important practical tasks of management. The workers who understand the value of what they are doing, who don’t get distracted or disenchanted and aren’t drained by anxiety and conflict will produce more and better work. Sensitivity, good communication and empathy (of which machismo is short) are keys to increased productivity and hence profit.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the history of work, managing the psyches of our colleagues and employees is a very new challenge. Machismo was a response to situation we don’t find ourselves in any more. It’s a general issue: we learn skills and attitudes in one environment and get into the habit of relying on them. Then the situation changes, but we don’t manage to adapt. At college we get trained to write long essays with lots of footnotes and lots of evidence and arguments; two years later your powerpoint presentation is judged on brevity and clarity. It’s the same issue in emotional management. We’re only just learning the next move.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to get irritated by people who are very concerned about details. They are bothered by a comma, in the wrong place (that was on purpose); they get upset if the dishwasher is stacked in a suboptimal way; it takes them a month to select a colour to repaint the bedroom; they know the price of a paper clip or count the number of emails they send in a week. We’ve got some pretty negative names for their attitude: they are pernickety, obsessive, perfectionist, pedantic. They lack a sense of proportion; behind their backs we mock them for their absurd devotion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in literature and the arts, there’s a different view of fussiness; here it seems like a prestigious virtue. </span></p>
<p>In poetry, changing a few words makes the difference between something that can live for generations and and a nice enough effort that sinks with hardly a trace. T.S. Eliot, for instance, had a poem sitting in his desk drawer for years.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/books121709_04.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9832" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/books121709_04.jpeg?resize=635%2C445" alt="books121709_04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He eventually showed it to his very fussy friend Ezra Pound, who suggested a multitude of cuts and changes to the wording. Thanks to Pound’s obsessive concern with detail, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Waste Land</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was eventually published in 1922 and has been voted the greatest poem of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ezra_Pound_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9833" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ezra_Pound_2.jpg?resize=635%2C654" alt="NPG Ax7811; Ezra Pound by Alvin Langdon Coburn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Ezra Pound: the fussy friend who made <i>The Waste Land</i> the greatest poem of the 20th century</h5>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9839" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.png?resize=500%2C628" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Waste Land</em> &#8211; with Pound’s fussy notes</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crucial point about fussiness in such cases is that it is carefully targeted. The creative fusspot has a big idea about why it’s important to focus with such intensity on certain details. This sense of an overarching purpose helps us see the difference between art at its best and its mediocre versions. Great artists are incredibly obsessed about detail &#8211; but not about just any detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modestly able painter might try to rival a photograph: they want to show every detail of what they see. When painting a portrait they set out to show as accurately as possible what a person looks like. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9834" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d.jpg?resize=635%2C776" alt="23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Winterhalter was careful to show the exact shape of her earlobe and every strand of hair curling over her neck</h5>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9835" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse.jpg?resize=622%2C649" alt="Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Matisse didn’t care about the exact shape of her ears</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great artists &#8211; by contrast &#8211; are rigorously selective. Matisse was massively interested in colour contrasts and harmonies and went to endless trouble to get exactly the right shade of blue for the background. But he didn’t care at all about individual strands of hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great artists&#8217;s ideas about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details to focus on are guided by a key question: what am I trying to convey here, what’s my task and goal? If the aim is to capture the essence of a personality then not every detail is equally important. A detail becomes eloquent because of the work it does. The great artist is guided by the needs of the beholder. They are always asking: why is this particular detail helpful to the viewer? </span></p>
<p>Artists and writers don’t usually see themselves as primarily engaged in commerce. Although ironically their best achievements often turn out to be amongst the most economically rewarding of all investments: a Matisse painting bought in the 1930s for the same price as a small family car would buy a private jet today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can take the lessons about details in art and use them in thinking about commercial enterprise. Around business some details might matter hugely, others might be unimportant.  Ideally, a business should define its overarching aim and then work out which details it really needs to get fussy about and, equally, understand which ones can be safely ignored.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22004863999_c02983d56a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9846" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22004863999_c02983d56a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="22004863999_c02983d56a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see some cases where this hasn’t happened. An airline, in its key business class service, offers six kinds of champagne, but the cabin temperature is often too hot or cold. If one is stifling or freezing, the particular brand of champagne one is drinking won’t matter very much. Or a car company might have invested hugely to shave two seconds off the time in which the vehicle can accelerate from 0-60 mph &#8211; although almost no one will ever put this to the test. But the dashboard layout isn’t very elegant &#8211; even though this is something you look at all the time. Their interest in details hasn’t tracked the ingredients of the master-goal: a happy driving experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, a company would deploy fussiness strategically to advance its core ambitions. A hotel that’s really focused on helping one get a good night’s sleep might not fret too much about what kind of chocolate is in the mini bar. Because finding the perfect chocolate isn’t much linked to repose. But whether the fridge hums is a crucial issue &#8211; as is the sound of the bathroom extractor fan and the sound a neighbor&#8217;s door makes when opened and closed late at night or in the early morning. An obsession with silent doors could be a major item in an advertising campaign.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4713209358_99b7a8195e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9848" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4713209358_99b7a8195e_b.jpg?resize=635%2C652" alt="4713209358_99b7a8195e_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What actually bothers us about fussy people is not that they are interested in detail &#8211; but rather that we sense that they are focused on the wrong details &#8211; that is, on unimportant ones. Businesses need to recruit and honour fussy people &#8211; because fussiness well directed is a key to commercial success. The person who is, at the moment, preoccupied by wiping dust from their computer screen or stacking piles of documents neatly doesn’t need to relax and stop being so fussy. They just need to find a more worthy and commercially significant target for their wonderful ability to get obsessive about details.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many new and potentially very worthwhile ideas for products and services are routinely cast aside by companies with the objection: we must give customers what they want. Which really means: what we have sold them (and prospered from selling them) until now.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneath this response lies a widespread view that consumers must already have a clear and settled idea of what they are looking for in any particular area &#8211; and that this cannot change any more than the cycle of the planets or the laws of motion. Reference to customer taste is therefore a reason to close down any suggestion that deviates from present patterns of demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its worst, an idea of the unbudgeable nature of customer desire becomes a justification for a businesses to serve up fairly dispiriting things. It explains the dogged adherence to mediocre food:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2693188749_a00c39776e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9674" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2693188749_a00c39776e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2693188749_a00c39776e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underwhelming architecture:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P2190060.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9672" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P2190060.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unambitious TV:</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9673" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And standardised holiday offerings.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6662824805_00392451f7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9679" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6662824805_00392451f7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6662824805_00392451f7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of giving customers what they want feels powerful for several reasons. It’s always tempting to stick with a currently successful model that paid for your office, pension scheme and (perhaps) jet. It can also seem arrogant or plain snobbish to hint that there might be a way in which customers don’t quite know what they want &#8211; and that you might be the person to understand tastes they’ve as yet given no evidence of having. Finally, insisting you have the answer to the unexplored wishes of consumers can put you in a recklessly vulnerable position in the politics of the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequence is that avenues of pleasure and satisfaction go unexplored and opportunities for growth are set aside &#8211; and move elsewhere (normally to start-ups). Many people in a given corporation may well feel unexcited by the current focus. They might be working fairly hard to meet their sales targets but they are running only for the money rather than tapping into the great resources we find in ourselves when we truly believe in what we are doing. Yet, when someone says that perhaps the business could offer something more impressive, the same answer tends to come back: we have to give people what they want. It’s a way of thinking that lends confidence to the most conservative impulses in our nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the core notion of ‘giving the customer what they want’ is profoundly under-examined and worthy of critical assessment. Of course, the idea of pleasing customers is not in dispute. What needs to be targeted, however, is the mistaken assumption &#8211; working away in the background &#8211; that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people want is a fixed factor &#8211; when in truth, what people want is dramatically malleable, contingent and divergent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that what people want is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well established is invariably based on a very small time frame and geographically-bounded sample-size. All we need to do is widen the angle of observation, and a remarkably different picture always emerges. For anyone seeking the confidence to make changes, there’s one unexpected place for immediate inspiration: the history of Culture. </span></p>
<p>When we look back in time, we see an extraordinary range of foreign concerns that seem to violate what we currently understand as consumer taste. For example, in 18th century Britain, members of the same species as we belong to today, the species reputed only to have an appetite for talent shows and celebrity quizzes on TV, got interested on a big scale in poetry. Alexander Pope, the leading poet of the day introduced the twelve syllable hexameter (against the advice of many) and was convinced that consumers would be highly sensitive to its rhythms. He was right. People loved the slightly slower pace and the neater rhymes it made possible &#8211; and he was able to buy himself a magnificent villa, just outside London, on the proceeds.</p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">How did a poet earn enough to have this house?</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an age when we tell ourselves that the only way to be erotic is to reveal more of our bodies, we can take inspiration from a look back to 18th century English fashion, when covering everything except your angle was all the rage.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.jpg?resize=500%2C675" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">A tiny lift in the hemline gave ankles a new meaning</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raking of gravel is not something that, at present, seems like a major human concern. But in Japan, over many centuries, people became interested in the patterns into which gravel could be arranged in even very small gardens. Getting it right was hugely important to them. They also became very sensitive to the different characteristics of moss and the best ways of grouping rocks together. It’s evidence of how &#8211; under the right encouragement &#8211; large groups of people can become highly sensitive to features which, in other societies, go entirely unnoticed. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9677" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.jpg?resize=618%2C621" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been so many moments in cultural history where huge leaps occurred in the kind of things people realised they could like. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9678" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">There were plenty of people at first who were convinced the public would never go for works like this</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1874, the First Impressionist Exhibition met with immense abuse. There was a widespread feeling amongst art dealers that the public would never warm to things which were so different from what they were currently buying, with brushworth that was choppy, deliberately disjointed and imprecise. However, within a few years, the art market was transformed. </span></p>
<p>Until 1915 most sculpture looked rather like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9681" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image091.jpg?resize=300%2C536" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then people quickly started getting more excited by this: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9682" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.jpg?resize=550%2C660" alt="Unique Forms of Continuity in Space 1913, cast 1972 by Umberto Boccioni 1882-1916" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cultural instances reveal a fundamental fact about how the whole basis of our excitement can shift in dramatic ways. Taste is a variable factor. We’re very good at appreciating moves of taste </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in retrospect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; but in advance we are so much less alive to the inevitable repetition of the phenomenon. Therefore, businesses routinely end up assuming that their customers don’t care about anything they are not currently getting; and get bogged down in the worry that if they introduced something they feel is better &#8211; but rather different from current offerings &#8211; they will be punished. Such timidity tends to doom them. </span></p>
<p>Many businesses could be expanded, redefined or started on more competitive lines by taking consumer demand to new and very good places. There are three guiding principles for changing consumer taste:</p>
<p><em>1.<b> </b></em><i>Doing it with Confidence</i></p>
<p>If you have a good idea which is at the moment out of kilter with the norm, it’s important to be entirely unapologetic. Friedrich Nietzsche is arguably the most admired philosopher of all time; thousands of graduate students are currently writing theses using his ideas. But for much of his career he was an isolated individual living in cheap hotel rooms. But you can’t tell this from his books, which are miracles of confidence. He continually announces himself as the voice of a new era and insists that all philosophy hitherto has been awaiting for his insights to be properly useful. You don’t get the impression that he’s living with almost no friends or that he can’t afford a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nietzsche is demonstrating that confidence is a powerful psychological tool: the well-expressed sureness of one person is infectious. Confidence relies on a crucial insight: people looking on are less securely wedded to their current beliefs than we usually suppose. The confident person remembers that most people want to fit in. So if you carry it off, they will fit in with you.</span></p>
<p><i>2. Connecting yourself to the Past</i></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image041.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9683" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image041.png?resize=500%2C381" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Swiss architect Le Corbusier wanted to enthuse the world about modern design, he made a move all innovators can learn from. Rather than saying that modernist architecture was new, he went far out of his way to show that it was in fact a direct continuation of the most revered traditions of the architecture of the past. It was more loyal to the past than more recent work. His polemical text, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards a New Architecture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, repeatedly drew analogies between the modern things he liked, cars and planes especially, and the most prestigious objects of Ancient Western culture. He was placing what he &#8211; and people like him &#8211; approved of in a bigger narrative, laying claim to a sense of natural progression. He wasn’t just making this up as a convenient cover story. He was helping his audience to trust that what was new was in fact, all along, faithful to what they already loved.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image10.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9684" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image10.png?resize=800%2C363" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picasso made a similar move when in 1957 he painted his own version of one of the central masterpieces of European art: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las Meninas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Velázquez (painted in 1656). Picasso’s style was radically different from that of his predecessor. But Picasso was situating his work within the grandest tradition of artistic ambition, teaching his viewers that respect for tradition was entirely consistent with enthusiasm for his own work.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 . Refusing all market research</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard idea of companies seeking to innovate but at the same time cover their backs is to commission market research &#8211; hoping thereby to discover the latent but till now unexplored needs of their customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But asking people about their preferences can never give us valuable clues as to what they could, perhaps quite soon, come to want &#8211; given the right prompting &#8211; because most of us are simply not self-aware enough to know what is missing from our lives. We know what we like when, but not a minute before, we are given it. We cannot know the shape of our future needs, no more than bookshop browsers in 1910 could have given a pollster an accurate description of their appetite for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Marcel Proust, a novel that these customers would nevertheless be enjoying in large numbers only a few years later.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3364869548_c40ab5cdbe_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9694" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3364869548_c40ab5cdbe_z.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="3364869548_c40ab5cdbe_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to produce the products of the future is to interrogate one’s own soul with sufficient tenacity and insight. In other words, to be creative. An over-reliance on market research is a fateful obstacle to innovation (and therefore growth and profit), for it can never show us how things that do not yet exist will answer to an audience’s tastes.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that companies should simply give people what they want isn’t as powerful a route to safety as it can sound. It is indeed at odds with the bigger facts of culture which show just how flexible, surprising and fast-moving change often is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are still at the dawn of the history of commercial opportunity. At the moment we have firmly in our sights certain needs which have produced reliable returns &#8211; the need for petrol cars that are individually owned, for large handbags with golden clasps, for TV shows with large laughing audiences&#8230; But, comparatively speaking, we’ve barely scratched the surface of human needs. There might be so many new and different things we could come to care about. To close, we’d like to sketch very briefly how three large commercial areas could evolve.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The News</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news industry is going through tough times. Suggesting that this has anything to do with the quality of the product is likely to receive a sharp rebuff from those in the business. The diet of murders, celebrity stories and sarcastic interviews with politicians is apparently exactly what the public wants. But is it really? Might there be room for innovations that appeal to different sides of our natures, sides of us that love sex but not sexual titillation, that want things to be entertaining but meaningful, that want to know bad news but also remain purposeful and resilient?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3550014051_dfef822f78_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9696" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3550014051_dfef822f78_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3550014051_dfef822f78_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The houses we build</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property developers tell us that taste in housing has all been settled long ago. Customers want either glass towers filled with apartments or else neo-Georgian villas in the suburbs. At the moment some of the biggest architectural developments around the world are assessed only with respect to a couple of areas of interest: are they the tallest in the world and is their shape similar to some small item like a piece of fruit or a phone? But in principle we, the audience, could be sensitised to other, possibly more important, characteristics: do our homes enhance the skyline, do they sit nicely amongst their neighbours at street level or how will they look in 50 years time?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3276057383_08464ce36e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9699" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3276057383_08464ce36e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="3276057383_08464ce36e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How we go on holiday</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present holidays are categorised by destination: beach, city, mountains and so on. Very little attention has been paid to one’s more emotional desires: to repair a relationship, to bond with the family, to make new friends, to spend time alone. We’re not collectively sensitised to new and potentially very helpful ambitions about what a holiday could be for.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast-food we eat</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently it has to be burgers and fries, especially when are in a drive-in. But we’re the same species that, in 16th century Japan, ate squid and fried eel on the go &#8211; and in Ancient Rome, snacked on marinated duck livers. A far wider road lies open before us than we have as yet dared to imagine.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re not necessarily involved in this kind of judgement ourselves &#8211; but we recognise the phenomenon in our society well enough: the more someone earns, the more they are likely to be admired by strangers; and perceived as interesting and exciting. Respect appears all too often to be directly awarded according to earnings. And, in a related move, if you don’t have much economic endorsement, it can be hard for your character or views to be taken seriously by your society.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a mystery that this relationship got established, because there are so many conspicuous cases where we find a genuine link between talent, effort, skill, contribution &#8211; and income. The most impressive examples involve the brilliant surgeon, the authors of Matilda and Harry Potter or the team behind the development of graphene. All these geniuses had a lot of talent, they made a lot of money and their contributions are terrific. They make the connections between a high income and virtue seem right and natural.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9649" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010-1.jpg?resize=550%2C627" alt="730px-J._K._Rowling_2010 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s cases like this that give us a natural propensity to suppose that income simply is the chief accurate and proper indicator of the value a person is making to the lives of others &#8211; and therefore that respect should closely track income. This is the view of modern capitalism, and is the spirit one breathes in the big cities of the world’s rich countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an intuitive emotional response to wages operates with a background economic theory, which we may never describe to ourselves directly but which could in fact be stated as follows: a person’s wages are determined by the scale of their social contribution.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5793535047_2d8223c5e0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9651" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5793535047_2d8223c5e0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Wal-Mart Shareholders Meeting 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But turn to the pages of economics textbooks, and a very different, far less emotive, account of wages emerges. Economics states that wages are a rather simpler business. They are exclusively determined not by social contribution per se, but by the number of people able and willing to do a given job that others want done. If there are lots of people able to complete the task, you won’t need to offer very much money to get their labour; and if there are very few people able to to do the job, you will have to pay a lot more. But note that in all this, there is no room whatsoever to judge the worth of the work being done; the determinant of wages is just the strength of demand in relation to supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken in one direction, this explains the salary of a hitman, a person who can &#8211; for the most exacting and difficult missions, where the target possesses private guards and is protected by triple glazed Bosch-security glass &#8211; extract an early seven figure sum &#8211; simply because almost no one on earth is capable of carrying out such a complex manoeuvre. Taken in the other direction, the same theory of wages explains the salary of the modern hospice nurse, charged with accompanying people through their last days (a task as meaningful as one could imagine), yet whose yearly salary is a tiny fraction of the murderer’s stipend. In neither case do the wages have any connection to the contributions being made; it simply has to do with how many people are capable of carrying out a task and how much demand there is for it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9653" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k.jpg?resize=635%2C602" alt="8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It so happens that in our society, some really wonderful qualities &#8211; like consideration, sympathy and hard work &#8211; are rather widespread; which is lovely but also has a deeply paradoxical consequence: that you can employ someone with astonishing qualities and get away with offering them pretty much nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hitman may have made his money in appalling ways, but unless society asks very careful questions, the world will mostly just see his money and be impressed: they will admire his villa, his sports car, his attractive girls&#8230;and in time he may even emerge as a respected and admired member of the community, who in his declining years wins the hearts of the whole of his society by funding a neonatal unit or new brain scanning department.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9655" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the nurse, however much we may pay lipservice to the idea that she’s very valuable, much of the time she will just be an anonymous figure in the bus queue; she’ll not be sought out, people visiting her tiny flat will be a touch sorry for her because the bathroom really does need some work, and her washing machine is held together by duct tape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When these divergent fates are vivid in our minds &#8211; the feted hitman and the downtrodden nurse &#8211; the whole economic system can seem entirely lacking in justice: and our minds rebel against the gross violation of the principles of fairness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9657" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s normal if we should then scan the horizon in the hope of finding some answers that can attenuate the pain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the history of the West, there have been two huge intellectual attempts to resolve this impression of injustice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is Christianity: a doctrine which has insisted that a person’s worth is to be determined in an entirely different sense to the financial. After death, a person’s soul will be weighed by god and his or her true merits perfectly rewarded for eternity. For eternity, the kindness and devotion of the nurse would be celebrated by the angels. Wages can’t change on earth, but the meaning of the wage will &#8211; in the eyes of Christianity &#8211; be altered, and the humiliation of poverty should hence entirely lose its sting.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9659" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big attempt to introduce justice took place under the tranquil dome of the central reading room of the British library in the mid-19th century, where a bearded man sat through long sultry summers and gelid winters penning a dense treatise on Capital. Karl Marx’s work argued for a new world in which workers would for the first time be rewarded according to the worth of their contributions to society. Down would go the wages of the hitmen, casino owners and mining tycoons; up would go the wages of the nurse and the farmer. Communism would return justice to incomes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Karl_Marx_001-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9661" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Karl_Marx_001-1.jpg?resize=635%2C663" alt="Karl_Marx_001 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their own day, these seemed like very impressive solutions. Yet, for different reasons, they are not in any way things we can now put our hopes on. The current economic order is pretty firmly established and is not about to change any time soon. But the hopes remain for some way of dealing with the disjuncture between wages and contribution or wages and respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be an odd place to look, but the most immediately usable solution to the situation may lie in a very unexpected place: the walls of an upper gallery in the Wallace Collection in London’s Manchester Square, home to a small painting called <em>The Lacemaker,</em> by a little-known German artist named Caspar Netscher, who painted it in 1664.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9640" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.png?resize=635%2C650" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve caught the lacemaker in what looks like a quiet mid-afternoon. She’s concentrating on her difficult task, carefully threading her needle. It will take her around five hours to make just one square centimetre. Her eyes will tire. She will make something dazzling and moving, an externalisation of the best sides of her nature.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9641" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.png?resize=800%2C492" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And her reward for her exquisite craftsmanship will be a few pennies at best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacemaking was a major industry for women in the 17th and 18th centuries, but, as it happens, it was also one of the lowest paid, for a stubborn, unbudgeable reason we’re coming now to understand: lots of people could do this work.</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, many artists were drawn to paint lacemakers at their task. These artists had no hopes of reforming how lacemakers got paid, but they had an ambition to change the lives of lacemakers nevertheless. They wanted to use art to alter the status of these lacemakers. By directing viewers to the intelligence and dignity of the craft of lacemaking, they hoped to redeem the social standing of this economically slighted class.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-1671.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9643" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-1671.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_(c.1669-1671)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-lacemaker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9644" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-lacemaker.jpg?resize=635%2C652" alt="the-lacemaker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artists painted lacemakers with all the same tenderness and appreciation as one might accord to a wealthy patron. Through art, we were to stop seeing lacemakers as people who deserved to be ignored and whose low income was any kind of reflection of a lack of merit. Instead we would see them as people full of talent and humanity who &#8211; as it happened &#8211; were just doing a low wage paid job by the accidents of the economic laws of supply and demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the artists were doing with lacemakers reflects a general capacity of art: to redraw what we think of as prestigious and to return proper appreciation for what certain people, especially those deemed marginal by the dominant social hierarchy, are and do. Art offers us a sensitive re-appraisal of a person’s true merit &#8211; and a complete willingness to disregard wages as a guide to human value.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image031.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9645" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image031.png?resize=635%2C635" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, for all the status we accord it, art is a small thing in the world. But the move that art has made needs to, and can, be redeployed on much larger scale, not just for lacemakers but for all those whose contribution is not currently properly reflected in their wages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art insists that we be suspicious of wages as an inviolable guide to the value of human beings; they are nothing of the sort &#8211; for they regularly and constantly leave out of the orbit of status people who eminently deserve our honour. We can live in hope of a fairer economy and must search for how to bring it about, but we should recognise that a realistic path to it is currently very hard to chart. It is here that Netscher’s move has such powerful solace to offer us right now.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image022.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9647" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image022.png?resize=327%2C450" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The way art operates promises an end to a sense of being randomly ignored and humiliated just on the basis of what money we have been able to make. Art is a mechanism for appreciation, which is particularly adept at the close study of the ways in which an individual might be deserving of tenderness, sympathy and admiration &#8211; and yet neglected by the prestigious world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art offers us a best immediate move for remedying at least a part of the problem of the gap between money and human value. The goal of art is to increase the amount of dense and accurate information about people’s jobs &#8211; so that we can stop using mere wages as our measuring rods. Once we get to know people well, in art or otherwise, the state of their bank balance will invariably decline &#8211; and what they are really bringing to the task starts to emerge, along with a fairer way of distributing honour.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is common to hear that unemployment has been caused by our genius at mass producing things and systematising processes; we have become so efficient at making goods and generating services, there is now a great deal less work for people to do. We have run out of needs, and therefore, of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the developed world, it may seem as if we simply all have enough now &#8211; enough fridges, clothes and cars &#8211; and, therefore, that consumption has reached a kind of limit &#8211; and employment along with it. As a result, a large share of the population seems fated to have nothing to do other than survive on charity and government hand-outs, for there is simply nothing for them to do: our needs have been met. We may be prepared to grant that unemployment in the undeveloped world is a little different; there’s so much to do there after all, and one can point to factors such as poor skills, corruption, lack of access to finance and bad transportation as the central reasons why employment prospects in these less fortunate lands have been held back. But in the rich world, it can seem as if economies have stagnated principally because we’ve run out of things we want to buy from and sell to one another.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2385966735_fdb4436673_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9203" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2385966735_fdb4436673_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="2385966735_fdb4436673_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can always conjur up some vain and unnecessary desires &#8211; yet another fashion fad or more unnecessary phone apps or video games &#8211; but this doesn’t take away from the main thrust of the argument. We’ve run out of true needs &#8211; and that’s why there isn’t enough good, meaningful work about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this cannot &#8211; on closer examination &#8211; really be true. The rich world remains full of genuine unmet needs and therefore full of honest employment possibilities. To get a sense of the untapped opportunities, we need only think of all the things that make us miserable on a day-to-day basis: behind most of our quotidian frustrations and griefs, entire industries are waiting to be created. There will be no so-called legitimate, deserved unemployment until the day when all our needs have been met or, put another way, until everyone is content and satiated. We’re still rather a long way off this point. The unemployment that currently exists is in no way inevitable or necessary: it is a symptom of our inability to identify and then adequately organise ourselves to satisfy our needs.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14533418893_8afc9d383b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9205" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14533418893_8afc9d383b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C400" alt="14533418893_8afc9d383b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might say that we know what our needs are well enough; we just don’t have the right technology to meet them. This line insists that what is holding back the development of new industries is first and foremost technological stagnation. Until innovation in technology allows us to fix a fresh range of issues, we must just sit out our days idly and wait for the scientists and engineers to catch up with our needs. This belief is lent credence by all the cases where technological developments did indeed lead to the creation of high-employment industries. We can think of the consequences of the development of the combustion engine, computer code or stem cell treatments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an absence of technology cannot be held responsible for all the needs we have that are currently going unmet &#8211; and therefore all the unemployment which dogs our societies. We know from history that a great many of our once unmet needs were later fulfilled (with huge implications for employment) in ways that didn’t depend on the development of any particularly radical kind of technology. There may well have been a process of standardisation and industrialisation, but no genius-level scientific fix was needed. In fact, more interestingly, new jobs were created because certain of our needs came into focus; they entered our imaginations as things we wanted; we became more aware of things that were missing in our lives &#8211; and jobs followed on a large scale.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20849391140_255f97f491_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9208" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20849391140_255f97f491_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="20849391140_255f97f491_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example, the development of the enormous industry that surrounds seaside holidays. The sea has been around a long time. Yet it’s only relatively recently that humans have discovered the pleasure of bathing in salt water, then lying on a towel in the warmth for a few hours. Mountains too have been around for a while, but only in the last 200 years have a sizeable number of humans thought of gaining inner peace, health and perspective by going to wander around in them &#8211; with enormous implications for employment. Everything needed to build comfortable sofas has been known for centuries, but it’s only in the 20th century that we’ve seen the point of mass manufacturing furniture on which to loll. The same arguments could be made in relation to other new and enormous industries: those that provide us with sparkling water and toilets, aerobic instructors and marriage counsellors, pop songs and sushi, national museums and children’s playgrounds, football and pizzerias, daily newspapers and gardening centers, management consultancies and insurance firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retrospectively, we can see how difficulties that people once regarded as just part of life, acts of god, were gradually systematically addressed. The satisfaction of latent demands has not been frivolous; awakening them has meant the deployment of intelligence, imagination and kindness: the recognition that certain valuable, even sometimes crucial things for a good life, were missing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16677352530_fe94e80261_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9214" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16677352530_fe94e80261_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="16677352530_fe94e80261_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same point holds for us today: we retain many demands that don’t require technology to fill. If we run through some moments of a representative day we can pick up on a wide range of unsatisfied needs. At each point of these moments of dissatisfaction and disappointment we are encountering the early hints of what, in the future, should be major areas of new employment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the following sources of frustration or longing:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the ugliness of most cities and the desire to find nicer places to live</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inability to control our moods</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our failures to sleep very well</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the dramas around our relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our sense that we have wasted our talents at work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our feeling that we don’t have enough good friends or satisfying conversations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the challenges of raising children</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our desire to live more communally rather than in our own restricted families</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9017668520_98d5e43401_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9217" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9017668520_98d5e43401_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9017668520_98d5e43401_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these anxieties, reservations and disappointments are &#8211; seen from another angle &#8211; emergent demands and if these demands came into full focus, and were properly interpreted, they could generate new &#8211; highly useful &#8211; products and services and many new employment opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of relationship crises. One or other of you is sullen, then there&#8217;s a painful altercation. Suspicion and disappointment circulate. Voices are raised. A door gets slammed. Someone might end up sleeping on the couch. It’s awful. But we’re accustomed to feeling this is something we absolutely have to sort out ourselves. We don’t as yet treat it like having a broken arm or a faulty boiler: things that are automatically recognised as calling for specialist assistance (and employment). If in the future this latent demand were fully acknowledged, there would be large numbers of jobs connected to helping us in our relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17417282709_c68fec5005_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9219" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17417282709_c68fec5005_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="17417282709_c68fec5005_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far from being at a late stage of development of the workforce, we have as yet only learned how to meet a small portion of our major needs: only a small proportion of the things that go wrong in everyday life belong within the market as it is currently configured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The obstacles to the development of the products and services we need &#8211; and hence to the creation of new jobs &#8211; isn’t solely or predominantly technical or financial. The real obstacles are a lack of specialised skills around the identification and then the satisfaction of needs. There are perhaps three areas of skill that need to come together in order for a latent desire to be translated into a profitable and benign business that can generate future employment: Perception, Industrialisation and Persuasion. To look at these in a little more detail:  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: Perception </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of need &#8211; like the ones we’ve been noting &#8211; have to be clearly recognised. Underlying insights have to be firmed up; problems have to be seen as issues that can be addressed rather than as painful givens of nature. This is an act akin to artistic creation &#8211; the entrepreneur, like the artist, has to pick up on faint tremors in the human soul, and clearly define their nature and causes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8056046148_df2d458836_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9223" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8056046148_df2d458836_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8056046148_df2d458836_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: Industrialisation</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then come the challenges of industrialising and systematising solutions. It isn’t enough to cobble together responses. One has to create organisational flow charts, carefully identify job descriptions and scout for the right talent, manage large numbers of employees, research and develop specific products and services, organise finance, meet deadlines, cajole business partners, deal with complex regulatory and tax requirements, keep costs under control and be intensely focused on efficiency, competitiveness and profit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three:  Persuasion</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But none of this will work unless enough people can realise that they do in fact need a particular service or product. This means getting large numbers of people to recognise a problem as one they have &#8211; and to feel excited by the idea of a solution. They have to be moved not only to admit this is an area of difficulty but also to have a basically optimistic orientation. The relevant skill, here, is consciousness raising: getting others to find an appetite in themselves.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14154227507_8cb318a166_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9221" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14154227507_8cb318a166_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="14154227507_8cb318a166_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considered separately, all these skills exist, but their integration is highly challenging and elusive. People who are good at perception, are often weak at persuasion and lacking in industrial knowledge &#8211; so their originating insights can’t develop, while people who are good at industrialisation tend to be much less focused on perception. And persuading skills are generally subordinate to industrial abilities. Which means we’re not well placed to create new industries &#8211; and new work. The roadblocks are cognitive; we aren’t thinking properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search to reduce unemployment and create jobs has normally been focused on bluntly economic levers: keeping down inflation, tax breaks, regional support, the reduction of red tape around taking on new employees. But we can see another larger prior factor: the need to cultivate a particular mentality in which imaginative and executive skills are united. Unemployment is a tragedy that stems from our inability to understand ourselves well enough, then properly exploit what we have realised about our needs with the use of managerial and financial discipline.</span></p>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8493566614_d898db0521_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9071" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8493566614_d898db0521_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8493566614_d898db0521_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If someone at a party asked you what you did, and you said you were involved on a mission of some kind, people would look at you sort of strangely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in truth, we’d all benefit from focusing in on the purpose of our lives so that we can refer to them as missions of one kind or another.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the entrepreneur Elon Musk was at university, he asked himself very explicitly what his mission in life would be. He began by wondering what the world needed most urgently, then he looked into himself to see what his talents were and that led him to a list of four possible missions: space exploration, electric transportation, Artificial Intelligence and rewriting the human genome. In the end, Elon Musk chose the first two.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9075" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o.png?resize=500%2C658" alt="4525849781_cb7219f5a8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Few of us will ever settle on missions as mighty as these, but the notion of having a mission, rather than a mere job or hobby, remains widely applicable. How, then, can we learn to adopt the mission mindset?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Firstly, what matters is to adopt a certain seriousness about one’s life. The working bit will only be, at best, 50 years. So the challenge is around focus: how can one reduce the range of one’s enthusiasms and see that having so many interests is half the problem. Talk of a mission forces us to reduce what we care about down to just a few very big things: it privileges precision over breadth. You give yourself a specific target, aware of how much energy it will take to reach it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Secondly, a mission is about having a plan; and reducing the amount of times that, because one has no clear goal, one gets swept along by the plans of others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Then again, a mission is different from an ambition. An ambition starts with what you want. A mission centers around what others need. People with missions may well end up making money and having status, but that isn’t what led them to the mission in the first place. Missions are about the intrinsic worth of tasks.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15371194197_10e119fb37_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9084" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15371194197_10e119fb37_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15371194197_10e119fb37_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- The search for a mission requires you to ask: among all the problems facing humanity, what are the ones that properly interest me? Be alive to the small-scale but authentic concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Having focused on a problem of humanity that feels right for you, you then need to take an honest look at your own aptitutes. What truly are your talents? What can you contribute? That may require a lot of introspection, career counselling and experimentation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Then, where your skills and aptitudes intersect with the needs of the world, that is your distinctive zone: that’s where your mission lies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- A mission isn’t a mission because it is grand, but because it is precise. Examples of modest but crucial missions might be:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- a mission to improve the care that the elderly receive at the end of their lives</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or a mission to teach children music in an engaging way</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3696190320_6b8c13052c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9083" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3696190320_6b8c13052c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3696190320_6b8c13052c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or a mission to get the best pizzas out to the customers of north Liverpool or downtown San Diego.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Conceiving of a mission requires us to throw off an attitude of inner serfdom, where we imagine that only other people have the right to plan their lives &#8211; and everyone else must just surrender to accidents and random whims of employers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We can and should all have missions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a mission in hand, the next time you’re at a party, you won’t need to keep the conversation at the level of where you’re employed, you can answer with reference to the underlying logic of what you are up to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can, with no space helmet to your name, legitimately announce that you’re in this earth with a mission to carry out.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In theory, we respect teachers. But being a teacher isn’t glamorous. It’s a worthy &#8211; but slightly dull &#8211; profession. Our suspicions are encapsulated in our collective image of the teacher with the 1950s jacket.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/History-Boys-008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8781" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/History-Boys-008.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="History Boys" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we associate teachers so strongly with schools, it’s natural to assume somewhere in our minds that ‘teaching’ is something most people leave behind as they grow up. We tell ourselves that it takes a very special type of person to be a teacher &#8211; and assume that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re just not cut out for that kind of role.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in truth, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a teacher</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most central aspects of human life. Even if we don’t sign up to instruct adolescents in chemistry or history in a school, we will have to become teachers. There is no alternative but to master the art of teaching. Teaching just means getting an insight, emotion, state of mind or a skill from your head into the head of someone else. Teaching happens every hour of every waking day. But we’ve fatally misconstrued teaching as a specific professional </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">job</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when it’s in actuality a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">role </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that everyone has to dip into continually. Whether we like it or not, we’re very frequently required to teach. </span></p>
<p>Being a good teacher is fundamental in the following areas:</p>
<p><b><i>a) Relationships</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubles in relationships are almost always, at heart, related to poor teaching. There are things in our heads we can’t get across and things in theirs we can’t grasp. Misunderstandings abound and fury and resentment rises. The flashpoints come:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around sex</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There’s something you’d really like to do in bed with your partner; but you’re very nervous about how they might respond. The tendency is to feel it’s hopeless. Or to get insistent &#8211; which turns your partner off. This is really a teaching issue: we tend not to think of the situation as one where education, and therefore teaching, is the key concern. But that would actually be a more accurate and helpful frame. We don’t say: hold on, can I teach you a short course on attitudes to cunnilingus? But that’s actually what we should be doing. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19fd71b56ac034c552448aff2e4d3ede.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8783" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/19fd71b56ac034c552448aff2e4d3ede.jpg?resize=635%2C646" alt="19fd71b56ac034c552448aff2e4d3ede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Napoleon didn’t teach Josephine about his sexual needs</span></h5>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing a problem one is having at work</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you’d love to have your partner’s sympathy; but they’d need to understand quite a bit about the situation at work: why the strategy you’ve been pursuing doesn’t seem to be working, but is actually a good idea; why a certain colleague’s support turns out to be worse than their hostility; why the situation in Mexico matters so much. But getting them up to speed on all this is so hard, you want them just to understand already.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conveying your gripes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you get enraged by things like the way your partner stacks the dishwasher; by how they close the cupboard door in the bathroom; by their over-confidence about getting to the airport on time. Again, we don’t naturally think of it in these terms, but what’s at stake is teaching: you ideally want to teach your partner how to close the cupboard door, how to load the machine, how to catch a plane.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who you are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a huge underlying educational theme of relationships is teaching your partner about yourself. It’s a matter of trying to get them to understand the nature of the person they’ve got together with. The fact that &#8211; for you &#8211; certain things are extremely difficult which others take in their stride. Maybe you find filling in forms unbelievably challenging &#8211; not because you are lazy or irresponsible. But because form-filling was always your father’s thing and he made it seem terrifying and dangerous, it was something only he could do. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Caspar_David_Friedrich_018.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8784" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Caspar_David_Friedrich_018.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="Caspar_David_Friedrich_018" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>In love, we might &#8211; for example &#8211; find it very hard to teach each other the difference between rejection and the need for solitude</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps you really need to spend quite a lot of time alone not because you want to reject your partner, though that’s how they see it, if they don’t understand you properly; in fact it’s because there’s such a lot of things going on in your head that you need time with very low input to try to calm down. Ultimately, it can seem a mystery why you are the way you are. But the more careful explanation is often much less alarming that the worried constructions other people are liable to put on things. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Walt_Whitman_-_Brady-Handy_restored.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8785" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Walt_Whitman_-_Brady-Handy_restored.png?resize=635%2C570" alt="800px-Walt_Whitman_-_Brady-Handy_restored" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walt Whitman: like all of us: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I contain multitudes</span></i></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s so much that we never get around to communicating about ourselves &#8211; just what a particular piece of music means to us; why the holiday in Devon when you were fourteen was so memorable; why you like tidying the sock drawer… which counters the tendency in relationships for people to fall into quite narrowly-defined roles. Like the US poet Walt Whitman, we ‘contain multitudes’ &#8211; aspects of ourselves that might be endearing and interesting, but which we tend not to get round to teaching other people about.</span></p>
<p><b><i>b) Parenting</i></b><strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8786" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003.jpg?resize=635%2C619" alt="Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chardin: a lesson in how to have lunch</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parenting is an almost endless sequence of teaching tasks. One might be trying to get one’s child to understand: how to butter a piece of toast, how to avoid escalating a row; how to brush their teeth; how it’s possible to love someone and be angry with them at the same time; how tidying up can be fun; how money is important, yet not an accurate measure of worth; how to put up a tent; what your experience has taught you about the transport industry; what it is to be a friend …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to download as much of our accumulated wisdom as we possibly can; but doing so is a hugely tricky operation, requiring the best teaching skills. We mostly fluff it, partly because we’re not alive to the enormity of the pedagogical task.</span></p>
<p><b><i>c) Work</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are places that burden us with huge teaching requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving feedback is really teaching &#8211; though we don’t happen to call it that and so we don’t so easily recognise the true nature of the situation. You are trying to get the person to understand why something matters more than they suppose; or why this way of going about solving a problem is better; or how to know the difference between asking for help when you need it and being too needy and dependent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in most meetings, there are teaching tasks circulating: I need to teach you about this staffing problem; I need to teach your about the legal perspective; or why this hold up is occurring and why it can’t be solved the way you think it can. If the teaching is done well, there’s a huge potential gain. We tend not to see these as teaching tasks (with much in common with teaching a child how to find the area of a circle or ask for a train ticket in French) so we typically approach them without due respect for the difficulty of the task.</span></p>
<p><b><i>d) Friendship</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s natural to overlook the role of teaching in friendship, because friendship so often originates in a shared outlook. Yet, to be a true friend doesn’t involve formal lessons but it frequently entails teaching: trying to get your friend to see why a course of action they are keen on is not such a good idea; why they should worry less about one problem &#8211; and more about another. Wanting to teach a friend isn’t a mark of being patronising. It’s a desire to guide them to bits of the truth they may not yet have spotted.</span></p>
<p><b><i>e) Politics</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially politicians are in the business of teaching societies their ideas about matters of major collective importance: what a good economy is; how to view certain troubling sectors of society (the very rich, the very poor, the very different); what can be changed and what has to be put up with; what’s a realistic aspiration and when potentially dangerous overreach kicks in. We could gauge the health of a political system by asking: how good are the political leaders at teaching?</span></p>
<p><b>So this is a list of some of the things you’ll need to do to be a good teacher:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Have confidence in the business of teaching</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally we are the inheritors of a Romantic tradition that constantly tells us not to teach and instead to be enthusiastic about spontaneous, intuitive responses (go with your gut, listen to your heart). Our age is negative about the idea of teaching &#8211; outside of obviously technical fields. We understand there needs to be teaching when it comes to learning to ski or work out the area of an isosceles triangle. But we’re often quite resistant to the idea of ‘teaching’ around the core issues of human existence &#8211; who should one marry, what is beautiful or ugly, what the media is for, what cities should look like &#8211; we turn against the idea that there can be teachers, because we’re collectively inclined to the Romantic notion that these topics are purely personal and that wisdom can’t be transmitted. So no one has any right to teach. No one should be in a position of authority. We often bristle if someone tries to tell us what to do or how to think. We’re suspicious of the notion of authority in such areas and hence reluctant to see anyone as entitled to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a kind of healthy democratic headwind against which any desire to teach (to get others to learn from you) has to contend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we need to burn into our souls is the idea that &#8211; all the same &#8211; it is actually perfectly legitimate and reasonable to try to teach. Everyone has a lot to learn and everyone has something important to impart to others. We should also be deeply aligned with the approach of classical culture: seeing most human activities are areas where learning and teaching are possible and important. In the classical view of things, we can learn (via the teaching of others) how to be kind, how to be funny, how to be better at being married or single, how to run a country or write a successful tragic play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why we should remind ourselves just how deeply legitimate the idea of teaching is.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Admit that learning can be boring</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8787" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg?resize=635%2C643" alt="800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy,_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best teachers of the 19th century was scientist and educator Sir Humphry Davy. He was a very successful researcher in his own right: he discovered chlorine and invented a special kind of safety lamp for use in coal mines. He gave public lectures that were wildly popular, even though they dealt with abstruse and complex scientific topics. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8788" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davy filled his lectures with explosions and comic effects (he loved laughing gas); he made witty remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t simply being amusing. He was using fun to help him transmit serious ideas he was hugely committed to. He understood that an overwhelming obstacle to learning is boredom. If we get bored, we stop learning. Instead of getting sniffy about this and blaming people for being so feeble and lacking in the bole thirst for knowledge at any cost, Davy simply accepted it as a fact about the human mind and made sure his audiences never failed to learn for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was free of a fatal confusion of ideas which tempts those teaching to think that if what they have to say is important they must present it in a solemn manner. They feel that humour is unworthy of the dignity of the topic. But sadly that often just means that important things don’t get the recognition they deserve.</span></p>
<p><i>3. Understand &#8211; and disarm &#8211; the fear that learning this ‘isn’t for me’</i></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Elizabeth-David-shot-in-h-001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8789" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Elizabeth-David-shot-in-h-001.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Elizabeth David shot in her kitchen in Halsey St Chelsea" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth David was one of the great cookery writers of the twentieth century. But for quite a lot of people she was &#8211; despite her best intentions &#8211; an actual obstacle to learning to cook. Elizabeth David gave the impression that being interested in cooking was only for people like her: female and rather refined. She could say: ‘everyone can learn to cook’ &#8211; but the words alone are not enough to get over this kind of resistance.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4327657744_687a23d69d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8790" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4327657744_687a23d69d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4327657744_687a23d69d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, Jamie Oliver is as serious and knowledgeable about cuisine as Elizabeth David was (and he’s often said how much he’s learnt from her.) But he developed a major teaching strategy. To overcome the fear that cooking might be a bit too fiddly and a little too posh, he made huge strategic use of his own blokey, down-to-earth tendencies. He was, in effect, holding himself up as living </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproof</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a natural (but mistaken) fear: </span><b>the fear that people like me can’t learn this stuff.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of teaching goes wrong because of a background belief in the student that something they are is incompatible with a lesson. There’s a feeling that I can’t be who I am &#8211; the person I’ve always been, that my friends know me for, who I am comfortable with &#8211; AND get involved in knowing this new thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much everyone has some version of this. We might feel that we can’t learn coal-mining and be feminine. We might feel we can’t be really interested in making money and pay attention to the views of Karl Marx. Or that we can’t be interested in a fair, more equal society and get interested in 18th-century classical architecture. Or it can feel very awkward to like rough sex and be respectable; read Proust and play football; know engineering and be a feminine woman; be a great worker and make mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good teacher disarms these fears as much as possible &#8211; and the simplest, ideal way is to authentically and cheerfully embody the combination that’s supposed to be impossible.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Don’t seem High &amp; Mighty</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instinctively, we often suppose that what we say will be more authoritative and carry more weight if we can present ourselves as pretty much perfect. If you don’t make mistakes, you are going to seem right. Unfortunately, however, this attitude is very rarely shared by anyone who is on the learning side of the equation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we want to be reassured that the person doing the teaching knows what they are talking about in this particular instance. But the potential for the humiliation of the one learning is never far from the surface. We easily resent being taught. We easily feel that the one doing the teaching is showing off. All this might be very untrue in fact. But it’s the fact that we feel it that creates the obstacle to learning. Being taught places the student in a position (however momentary) of inferiority. You have something, they don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you’re teaching, it’s tremendously useful to surround any ‘lesson’ with active reassurance that you are on the same level basically &#8211; this lesson aside. Show that you too have faults, are often clumsy and goofy. Show that you too don’t know many things. You need to show areas of inferiority so that your own superiority in the teaching area won’t stick out and offend.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Don’t blame the learner for not knowing</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems paradoxical &#8211; once it is pointed out. But the fact is we often get very annoyed that someone doesn’t know something yet &#8211; and we assume they should, given who they are, at this point in their life, with their track-record&#8230; And so we go about the business of teaching them with a background grudge; we feel it’s their fault; they don’t know so they must be stupid, lazy or in some way inadequate. And this attitude makes it unlikely that what we have to teach will actually make its way successfully into this person’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance is not a defect of the individual: it’s the consequence of never having been properly taught &#8211; however old one or ostensibly ‘educated’ one happens to be. So the fault, rightly, really belongs with other people who haven’t done enough to get the needed ideas into this individual’s head or simply with the brute fact of belonging to our deeply flawed species. </span></p>
<p><i>6. Pick your moment</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in the right mood is a huge factor in how well we learn. We instinctively recognise this about ourselves. We feel too tired, too bothered about other things, too excited to take in anything tricky or serious. But it’s much harder to acknowledge this fact when it comes to other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend automatically to try to teach the lesson at the moment the problem arises, rather than selecting the moment when it is most likely to be attended to properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood is also crucial to how well we can teach, the more desperate you feel inside, the less likely you are to get through effectively. Unfortunately, we typically end up addressing the most delicate and complex teaching tasks just when we feel most irritated and distressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a panicked feeling that if I don’t jump on this right now it’s going to go on and on unchecked forever. Picking one’s moment means being very sure that you can avoid tackling something right now because you are determined to address it more effectively later on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being skilled at timing has often been recognised as a major virtue and accorded high prestige &#8211; in the history of  warfare, for instance. In 9 AD Germanic tribes won a major victory over the Roman legions. The less well equipped German tribesmen won because they chose their moment well &#8211; when the legions were passing through a thickly-wooded region and couldn’t form up in their accustomed order. Up until then, the Roman generals had assumed that the Germanic tribes would be unable to pick their moments wisely, but would always get so enraged by the sight of the enemy that they would attack on impulse. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8791" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909.jpg?resize=635%2C610" alt="Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By picking their moment, the fortunes of the Germanic tribes were transformed. Given how central teaching really is to our lives, and how much opportunity is squandered by poor timing, it’s strangely sad that we haven’t as yet developed a cult of great timing in addressing tricky matters in relationships or at work, passing down the stories from generation to generation of how, after years of getting nowhere with impulse-driven frontal assaults, she stood patiently by the dishwasher, waiting until she had put down the newspaper, and then carefully advanced her long prepared point, and eventually won a decisive teaching victory.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Simplify</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we’re familiar with something &#8211; which is a prerequisite for teaching &#8211; we’ve got a fatal tendency to forget how immensely confusion and challenging new things can be. So when we try to teach we launch into too much detail, we point out refinements before the person we are talking to has mastered the basics. In short, we forget what it was like not to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplification can sound a bit condescending. Because we’ve unfortunately come to assume that being complicated is pretty much the same as being intelligent. And we see simplification as the wilful ignoring of the more complex issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another way of looking at this. In fact, we almost never in practice use very complex ideas. We always work with boiled-down, clearer more basic ideas. Getting to these is the real goal.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wittgenstein1-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8792" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wittgenstein1-big.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="wittgenstein1-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We should take to heart Wittgenstein’s assertion:</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that can be said, can be said clearly.</span></i></p>
<p><i>8. Coat it in sugar</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquiring knowledge can be bitter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The church of the fourteen helpers in Bavaria was built about two hundred and fifty years ago. Strange as it might sound, the ideas that led to its construction are deeply important to the business of teaching. At that time, the Catholic Church wanted to enforce a specific moral. They wanted to say that everyday compassion and care, however humble and ordinary it might look from the outside, is hugely important. The Church wanted to make this message more active in people’s lives, edging us away from our natural selfishness and busy indifference. They had a key idea about something important and wanted to bring more people on board.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8793" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="PM-050214-monbiotA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">The carrot</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were also keen to avoid a technique which they’d been trying for centuries and that hadn’t worked so well: that of terrifying and guilt-tripping people into being good. So, in this part of Southern Germany, for a time at least, they settled on a different, much more intelligent technique. They weren’t going to talk about hell and damnation any more, they were going to try to seduce people into being good.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8794" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="PM-050214-monbiotB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stick</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bavarian church is important to teaching because it explores a very different approach. It doesn’t nag, it does not issue stern warnings or upbraid us for being selfish. It does not make us feel guilty about our failings.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8795" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="PM-050214-monbiotD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead the architect used every possible means to persuade people through excitement, pleasure, awe and delight. The interlocking domes and vaults are exceptionally beautiful – inducing a mood of lightness and vitality. It is splendid – but for a reason. It is expressing the true glory of modest goodwill. It wants to seduce us, charm us, into kindness. It acknowledges we might need a lot of encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a big lesson here for teachers. There are so many serious things we need collective persuading about. The rich need to be persuaded to be much more generous than they are currently being, bankers need to be encouraged to be more prudent around money, we should be more cautious about damaging the environment, more considered about what we eat and nicer to our children. Good ideas about all of these matters are very prominent already. But teaching too often attempts to motivate us by guilt, rather than charm us into goodness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most difficult moments in life are in essence f</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ailed teaching moments:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing one’s temper: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who is shouting &#8211; who has lost their temper &#8211; was trying to get a point across. Feeling unable to do so in quieter ways &#8211; but desperate to be understood &#8211; they start shouting, swearing and stamping their feet. If we could carefully unravel their intentions, we’d see that they are trying to teach the person they  are angry with (get them to see things in a particular way, to admit a fact).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdrawing: going cold and silent: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feeling that the other person ought to know, can inspire a refusal to teach. I want you to understand but I’m so angry that you don’t already that I will refuse to try.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contempt: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other person is an idiot: they don’t know and won’t learn. Current ignorance is seen as a reason not to teach.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shyness: lack of confidence: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching doesn’t feel legitimate. You fear that others won’t listen; they might get annoyed with you, make you feel ashamed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embarrassment, humiliation: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One feels so confused about what one’s trying to say. One has a go, but it feels boring, over serious, unduly harsh. The person you are speaking to loses interest, of course. You feel a failure.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despair: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But probably the biggest failure of teaching is when one gives up: you are lost for words, you don’t know where to start, you feel too awkward and nervous, too shy. The possibility of ever really getting the other person to understand fades away. It stops even occurring to you that you could teach them and change their way of thinking. This is expressed as sullenness: where one has come to feel that there’s no point in even trying to explain.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to teach all the time; but teaching is hard. Every day you&#8217;re called upon to perform these educational moves &#8211; at work, at home, with friends &#8211; without ever having signed up to the task. You didn’t ask to be a teacher. </span></p>
<p>The topics might be quite dissimilar &#8211; a lesson on how to put the butter back, how to code a piece of the website, how to cope with rejection &#8211; but they share many similar features. And they all boil down to the same core: how do you overcome the obstacles to getting what you understand into someone else’s head?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our society hasn’t as yet fully taken on board the scale of the challenge. So we don’t as yet have in place an educational system that assumes everyone is going to have to get good at teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it would be unfair to place the responsibility solely on the idea of teaching. There’s also the parallel, universal role of being the student. We all have to accept that other people have the right to try to teach us things (that we’re far from perfect) &#8211; and that they may be trying to teach us something very valuable, even if they’re making a complete mess of it. We must forgive the unskilled teacher, there may be a grain of truth beneath some blundering efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone is doing the teaching process badly, it’s unfortunately natural to assume that they don’t have anything to teach. And that what they are trying to get across is wrong. If you’re being boringly nagged about not eating enough broccoli or about the importance of checking the window locks before going out, it’s deeply tempting to reject not just the annoying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re being told, but also the validity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are being nagged about. We don’t just feel like shooting the messenger. We also want to shoot the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core point is taking seriously the idea that we’ve still got a lot to learn from other people and that being a student is a skill &#8211; even if the teacher isn’t up to scratch we can still extract a benefit from what they know that we don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a hopeful side to all this. We’re not as yet generally focused on learning how to teach; but it’s not a huge mystery. We already know collectively a lot about good teaching: we’re just not ambitious enough about deploying this knowledge very widely. We’ve seen teaching as a specialist professional skill that only a few people need to master. In fact, we’ve all got to get better at it in order to have somewhat less fractious lives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the ideas that circulates below the surface of modern life is that work diminishes our personalities. We get paid in return for giving up a vital part of who we are. We look forward to holidays and retirement in order to nurture our true selves.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This analysis is a legacy of the Romantic movement. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influential writers, artists and philosophers developed the view that the kind of work most people actually do &#8211; management, sales, manufacturing, logistics &#8211; is detrimental to the human spirit. The only exceptions to this analysis were a few jobs that were, and remain, not widely available in most societies: being a poet, novelist or artist. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/byron7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8745" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/byron7.jpg?resize=635%2C565" alt="byron7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Lord Byron: an influence on the assessment of modern logistics</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas (who spent some time in the US), often painted the deeply unheroic characteristics of the trading world. His brokers and speculators are presented as people who have a limited outlook. They are dull, uninspiring figures. They confirm our worst fears about how we might end up, after years in trade.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8746" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016.jpg?resize=635%2C501" alt="Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edgar Degas, <em>Bureau du coton à la Nouvelle-Orléans</em>, 1873</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only when we are off work that we can begin to be the interesting, real version of who we are.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8747" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251.jpg?resize=635%2C532" alt="db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Satanic Mills</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cyril Mann, 1925</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1840s, Henri Daumier won great success portraying lawyers as arrogant, greedy and dishonest. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8529946222_6b27d54379_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8748" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8529946222_6b27d54379_b.jpg?resize=635%2C401" alt="8529946222_6b27d54379_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may not have started out that way &#8211; they may have been eager reformers and crusaders for justice. But it was a profession (like most others) designed, Daumier thought, to crush anyone’s better nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our culture has taken to heart this sad Romantic notion of work. Sometimes it is more than deserved. But there is an important alternative view, which starts by being alive to some of the drawbacks of the Romantic idealisation of ‘home’. Of course there can be some pleasant times over the kitchen table on the weekend, but life outside of work is often full of challenges, humiliations and displays of the very worst kinds of behaviour. Home can be where we’re short of skills; a place of difficulty. One longs for Monday morning, for sanity to return.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fd100007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8749" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fd100007.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Fd100007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>He goes to the office to calm down; she finds it easier to run her business than manage her marriage</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our labour is not merely something we unfortunately have to do; it is ideally part of our development. Work is a place where we can learn the skills &#8211; and ultimately the maturity &#8211; that we might otherwise be very short of in the rest of our lives. Via the experience of work we might develop some crucial abilities:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Learn</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSF0830-Edit__924x0__.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSF0830-Edit__924x0__.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="_DSF0830-Edit__924x0__" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most workplaces are devoted to the idea of the progression and development of employees. They know how much easier it is to work with who they have, rather than constantly part ways with people. The fact that someone doesn’t yet know how to make an excellent presentation or how to manage an IT team isn’t seen as terminal. They can learn. They can do a course; get some practice; find a mentor, be assessed to check they’re making good enough progress. They can sit down with someone and determine what didn’t go so well and focus on what needs to be improved. Work has an idea of development inherent within it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, the domestic sphere is opposed to learning. We’re meant to know it all already: how to be a good friend, lover and parent. Except we generally have no clue &#8211; and never make much progress.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to express truths without causing upset</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business life constantly gives us lessons in the art of how to tell someone a tricky bit of information without them panicking or being horrified. Home life finds us far less tactful.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/677_10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8751" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/677_10.jpg?resize=635%2C666" alt="677_10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>In need of classes on feedback</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say nothing and fester or are brutal and give the blunt version of the hard facts. There are tears and slammed doors. </span></p>
<p>Clever businesses know they need to be experts in the arts of good communication. They can only function well because tricky news reaches the people who need to know it without destroying their esteem. So negative facts are not regarded in a personal light; there’s a protocol of giving plenty of support before firing the arrow, and there are traditions in which being open to criticism is seen as a major mark of character.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to listen to strange views</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romantic love is based on the notion of perfect agreement. One gets together with people because they see the world as one does. It’s a beautiful ideal &#8211; until there are conflicts, at which point the entire edifice of a relationship may be called into question. If we loved one another, would we ever disagree or see things differently?</span></p>

<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rembrandt: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Cloth Merchant’s Syndicate</em>, 1662</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work isn’t like this. These people (painted by Rembrandt in the 17th century) were the members of a ratings agency: grading the quality of bales of cloth, so that merchants could trade with confidence. This was central to Dutch trade. Each of the six individuals around the table has a very distinct personality, and would have come at many issues from quite alternative perspectives and yet they are united by the task at hand. They seem to bring their better selves to work: one imagines them as good at solving disagreements; they would have listened to each other with respect (‘I see your point; however, I wonder if perhaps …).</span></p>

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_Il_Tagliapanni_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8753" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_Il_Tagliapanni_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=550%2C639" alt="Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_('Il_Tagliapanni')_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all work is fiddly. It requires patience, it demands that we slow ourselves down and master hurdles. The cloth cutter has had to put aside a lot of his natural wildness and impulsiveness in order to make his living. To learn the trade means not just to acquire a means to earn money; it’s a coded lesson in growing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the Romantic view, it might be that we are quite often simply the better version of ourselves at work. We’re more dignified and more patient, more tolerant and more loveable. Furthermore, we are developing skills that &#8211; tantalisingly &#8211; are needed and can be used elsewhere, especially in the bedroom and kitchen. Rather than leaving work in order to relax, it might be that we need to come to work in order to be a better person and lover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As yet we’re not quite fully focused on this potential and so don’t see how big a contribution work could be making to our private lives. Being a good employee shouldn’t be that different from being that truly important thing, a good person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were sketching the utopia, we’d not be looking for a society in which people didn’t have to work. It would be one in which many more people had the chance to acquire via their work the skills which would be useful to them across the whole of their lives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we meet new people, we’re tempted to ask: &#8216;what do you do?&#8217; We’re picking up on the idea that our identity is very linked to our daily tasks. But the way the question is answered tends to lock on to the practical externals of our jobs. So a dental hygienist will explain how they keep plaque at bay; a corporate lawyer will mention a merger they’re engaged with that’s been in the news recently; a sound technician in a studio will detail how they rewire equipment, install new bits of routers and liaise with tricky ISPs around the world.</p>
<p>However, what’s more revealing, but more elusive, are the <i>psychological</i> requirements and consequences of jobs &#8211; what mindsets a job breeds, what doing the job requires of your inner life, how it expands us and (crucially) limits us.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8349" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Our culture usually skirts round this territory. If we asked: ‘what’s the psychological character of your work?’ the answers would look very different. The dental hygienist might say: I deal a lot with evasion and weakness of the will; otherwise intelligent, trustworthy people cancel on me all the time, blaming their schedules. When they do show up, they sit in my chair and repeatedly lie to me about how much they’ve flossed and break all their promises they made last time about looking after their teeth. I’m daily brought up against how hard adults find it to do pretty basic things that are in their own interests. It can make me a bit stern.&#8217;</p>
<p>The corporate lawyer might answer: &#8216;I’m daily up against the aggression and impatience of my clients. They want everything done yesterday. No one cares about anyone else’s private life. I see a lot of raw ambition &#8211; nothing would really surprise me about the human capacity for duplicity.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9291648625_319dc9bea3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8352" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9291648625_319dc9bea3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9291648625_319dc9bea3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The sound engineer might say: &#8216;problems crop up all the time, but you can always be sure you will find a solution if you are methodical and careful. There might be seven possible causes of a problem, and you have to check each one. But it’s definitely going to be one of those. I love technology in that sense, things are bounded and logical.&#8217;</p>
<p>We could categorise jobs in terms of their psychological profile &#8211; according to what traits of human nature they weaken or reinforce:</p>
<p><i>Patience vs. impatience</i>: does the job train you to instinctively prioritise what’s happening right now and to regard what might occur a few years down the line as not really your business (A+E nurse, news editor)? Or does it get you into the habit of plotting your concerns in the scale of several years? (aeronautical engineer, civil servant overseeing power station construction)</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8355" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="16371178501_34359cb448_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Flickr/Royal Navy Media</h6>
<p><i>Suspicious vs. trusting</i>: does your work sharpen your sense that the real agenda might be quite different from the overt one? Are you in an environment in which people usually keep their cards hidden or outright lie (journalist, antiques dealer, management consultancy)? Or does your work generally involve you with people who are very upfront about their true concerns (psychotherapy, skiing instructor, air traffic control)?</p>
<p><i>Speculative vs. concrete</i>: is the work focused on how things could be or on attention to how they happen to be? Does one get rewarded for envisioning things other people haven’t quite thought of (think tank researcher, poet, futurologist) or for careful attention to practical detail? (fresh fruit logistics, roofer)</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14947050571_da81956cb9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8361" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14947050571_da81956cb9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="14947050571_da81956cb9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i>Consensus-seeking vs. independent</i>: some kinds of work teach the ability to merge with the collective view (school teacher, holiday rep); others invite the foregrounding of a personal viewpoint, an unusual take on things where not doing what others are doing might be a key advantage? (tennis coach, entrepreneur)</p>
<p><i>Optimistic vs. pessimistic: </i>how does work encourage you to see the positives, and maybe avoid dwelling on the downsides (marketing, personal coaching, sommelier) or does it lead to a habit of foregrounding the dangers, the pitfalls and looming disasters? (accountants, in-house counsels)</p>
<p><i>Financially focused vs. sheltered from finance</i>: is one in an environment where status varies hugely with money (solicitor, corporate executive) and where it is instinctive to think in terms of costs and profit margins; or does the work day to day not really involve such considerations at all? (academic, teacher)</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8357" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg?resize=635%2C615" alt="733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i>Dignity is fragile vs. a solid status</i>: an artist is generally exposed to deep rebuffs; the things they have put their soul into may well be turned down or ignored. Even if they are pretty good at what they are doing, they may have no tangible public success. The eleventh best poet in the UK earned GBP 6,117 last financial year in royalties, advances, small grants and public appearance fees. Other jobs mean that reasonable application and ability is sure to be well rewarded: every bachelor of veterinary science is guaranteed a well-paying job.</p>
<p><i>Better nature vs. worse nature</i>: some jobs, however hard, continually remind you of the preciousness of life (palliative care, midwife) whereas in others you are always meeting the less admirable sides of human nature (police, family law).</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/402725350_72c28b37e8_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8364" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/402725350_72c28b37e8_o.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="402725350_72c28b37e8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i>Logical vs. haphazard hierarchy</i>: in some jobs, it’s clear what you have to do to move forward and how promotion occurs (airline pilot, teacher); in other jobs (television production, politics), the rules are a lot less settled and are bound up with accidents of friendship and fortuitous alliances. In the former, there is a calm and steadiness to the soul. In the latter, there is a constant anxiety &#8211; and lack of trust.</p>
<p><i>Being in a declining vs. a growing industry</i>: there are industries where it feels that the golden age was in the past; it’s probably less fun to be working in them now than it used to be (publishing, broadcast television, diplomatic service). Or is the whole industry growing, with all kinds of highly profitable new ventures emerging (social media, technology). Do you tend to work around people who feel they can conquer the world, or who sense that the world is about to conquer them?</p>

<p>Being in a particular psychological environment every day for years has a pretty big impact on our habits of mind. It influences what we assume other people are like, it forms our view of life and gradually shapes who we are. The psychology inculcated by the work we do doesn’t stay at work. We carry it with us into the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>We’re generally very aware that that can happen… in distant places. We understand that a French aristocrat in 1430 will have a particular outlook shaped by the fact that they have lived their life in a very strict social hierarchy,  surrounded by a warrior ethic; or that someone from a 19th-century fishing village in in the Western Isles of Scotland, who has spent years battling storms off Benbecula, will have have a character profoundly marked by their working life. We are no different. The only difference is that we find it much harder to notice what has happened in our own case, because &#8211; of course &#8211; our outlook feels natural to us, though it is anything but. It may take an encounter with an alien (in the shape of someone from a very different field) to get us to notice.</p>

<p>We can sometimes catch the effects of work on character in social situations. If you ask a solicitor, ‘what do you think cars will be like in 2035?’ they may be puzzled about why you would want to exercise your brain this way. What is the point of speculating about something currently unknowable? Obviously things will evolve in unexpected ways. But there will still be laws and courts and regulations. And we can deal with them when they arrive.</p>
<p>If you ask an academic, ‘what are your earnings per hour?’ or ‘what’s the financial return on your investigations into the history of Swedish grammar?’, they will find the question tendentious. &#8216;Why are you asking? What does it matter?&#8217; Though to you it may feel like an obvious point of enquiry. Or, if you raise with a commodities trader how their work benefits others the question might sound to them strangely naive: what would make you think the point of work was anything other than the personal advantage of the individual concerned?</p>
<p>We’re broadly aware that the way people learn to think at work can be traced in their domestic and social character. The primary school teacher treats their children as pupils, the academic lecturer becomes a windbag at dinner parties, the politician can’t help making speeches as weddings.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12245837686_d413da8fcb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8372" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12245837686_d413da8fcb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="12245837686_d413da8fcb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>But these are the tip of the iceberg, there are plenty other such cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technician is deeply calm and reassuring. Probably, they feel, all problems in life are a bit like the technical problems they have mastered at work. Most things can be put right, if you don’t panic and work your way down a checklist.</li>
<li>The TV executive has a fragile sense of self. They are quite aggressive when they think they are on top, but fold quickly when they sense the wind moving against them.</li>
<li>The dental hygienist becomes bossy. They are so used to having to upbraid people for being lax, it becomes a habit.</li>
<li>The freelance writer, who is always having to grudgingly mould their work to the demands of others, becomes used to feeling misunderstood and under-appreciated. At work, the better parts of their ambition have to be subordinated: their piece on Venezuelan architecture gets sidelined but their advertorial on the fashion for pink diamonds has a ready market. They’re always expecting to be misunderstood, and become hyper alert to any signs this might be happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work can be very good for people. The mentality fostered at work might be making up for aspects of the self that didn’t get properly developed before. In an office where speed and accuracy are crucially important, someone who is slightly scatterbrained might acquire a corrective to their earlier weakness. An environment where compromise feels natural can be hugely educational for the person who has been over-invested in asserting their own views.</p>
<p>But work can narrow our characters too. When a certain range of issues and ways of thinking become entrenched, it means that others start to feel awkward and even threatening.  A person who has become very used to implementing the ideas of others &#8211; and maybe very skilled at it &#8211; can then find it deeply uncomfortable to be put on the spot and asked what they think the big objectives should be. They’ve got entirely out of the habit of asking themselves such questions. A school administrator might be very sharp when it comes to how you would reorganise the the personnel roster, but if you ask ‘what is education for?’ it sounds baffling, like asking what is grass for or why is London in England not in Scotland?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8374" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Furthermore, something too moral and earnest might threaten the TV executive. Or an enquiry into their views on the French Revolution might might threaten a personal trainer. One feels that such questions are painful because they are reminders of what one has had to renounce in order to become focused on a particular job. By giving a large part of one’s life to a particular kind of work, one has &#8211; necessarily &#8211; not been able to life to do justice to other areas of potential. One has lost the power to engage with issues which might once have seemed intriguing.</p>
<p>The general idea that work shapes us applies, of course, to oneself. But precisely because certain attitudes and habits come to feel natural, it’s hard to notice that this has happened. There’s a fundamental question we might ask ourselves: in what ways might my own character have been shaped (for better or worse) by my work (just as it is important to grasp how one has been shaped by childhood)? There’s a poignant autobiographical question: if I’d done a different job, would I have been a different person? And the answer must be yes. Contained within other career paths are other plausible versions of oneself &#8211; which, if contemplated, reveal important, but currently undeveloped, elements of one’s character. It gives rise to the most tricky of questions: where are those other bits of me…?</p>
<p>Keeping in mind how work shapes a person means we should be slower to blame other people for the way they are. Perhaps it is their job, not ‘them’ that has made them as they are &#8211; that has made them so nervous, angry, or boring. It’s the employment environment we should blame, not them. The TV executive was not always like this, the corporate lawyer was not born as they now are. They might have been other people. Our identities are vulnerable to our jobs. And that may open the avenues of pity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We tend to be pretty clear why it might be nice to be in a leadership role. There’s more status, you get to decide how things should be and &#8211; very often &#8211; you get paid more too. But there are some dark aspects too.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are five of them… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: You become the object of satire</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The rise of satire</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s deeply pleasing to lob witty criticism. And it’s a natural tendency too.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2735622368_454c2173eb_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7760" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2735622368_454c2173eb_o.jpg?resize=635%2C276" alt="2735622368_454c2173eb_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1">They’re so good at identifying weakness and failings. The physics teacher is a bit disorganised, wears a jacket with strangely thin lapels and occasionally misses certain portions of his face when shaving.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might have something of a talent for this yourself. There has always been satire, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray.jpeg?resize=635%2C457" alt="640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1">The leading politicians are vain and stupid &#8211; and usually very ugly as well</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, the artist James Gillray portrayed Charles James Fox &#8211; leader of the Opposition &#8211; as a villainous looking half-wit (he’s standing centre right, slightly bowing, with a blue coat and yellow trousers, with a sword at his side). Everyone in the picture has their faults highlighted. Many look unbearably smug; there’s an individual in a crimson jacket bowing practically to the ground and looking farcically obsequious: it’s William Grenville who became Prime Minister a couple of years after the print appeared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gillray was regarded as the greatest satirist of the age. But by modern standards he was operating on a small scale. His works could only be seen by fairly small numbers of people. And his satire sat within a culture in which the traditions of respect and deference were still very strong. For a long time to come, it was easy and normal for those in power to feel that satire, while annoying, wasn’t actually terribly important. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles_James_Fox00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7757" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles_James_Fox00.jpg?resize=635%2C651" alt="Charles_James_Fox00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charles James Fox was generally portrayed in a more flattering light. In any case, his status was not derived from popularity or approval. In 1768, when he was nineteen, his father bought him a seat in parliament. The party he led, the Whigs, was largely made up of his friends and relatives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This, really, was what limited the power of Gillray’s effectiveness. He could be savage. But the manoeuvring of high politics largely went on without reference to popular opinion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One feature of the modern world &#8211; which mostly is great and very positive &#8211; is that people got sick of respect. And the disappearance of automatic respect occurred at the same time as a rise in the dependence of leaders on approval. The development of democracy and of market research has meant that leadership is often vulnerable to what strangers think. So caricature hits harder: it’s a bigger threat. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/March-1991-007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7761" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/March-1991-007.jpg?resize=635%2C336" alt="March-1991-007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homing in on the slightly ridiculous aspects of John Major, the British Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, (his tendency to look timid, his reputation for naivety, his fondness for the colour grey) wasn’t just a personal irritant. It undermined his public standing and weakened his electoral position. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moves we see played out at a national stage are also equally directed at more or less everyone who arrives in a position of leadership or authority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you become a leader &#8211; or a manager or a boss or an employer &#8211; you are on the side of satire. You are very adept at seeing what’s not going quite right, you are good at identifying who to blame and you can see all the mistakes and errors of those making the decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The powerful are the accepted targets of satire</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is hugely to our collective credit that we have come to find it unacceptable for the strong to mock the weak. We now reserve our sarcasm, jibes and fault finding for those we think can take it &#8211; and in fact deserve it &#8211; because they occupy the privileged positions; those who are in charge in some way are not only fair game: we almost feel it is our duty to voice our criticisms as loudly and as effectively as we can.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7763" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is very alive to the failures of power. Sympathy for the powerful is seen as naive. Which is fine, until you yourself end up in leadership. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">You will be misunderstood </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all looks very different from the point of view of the person in the leadership position. Fox certainly had his weaknesses (he liked gambling, he had multiple mistresses, he used to spit on the carpet) but he was also a major advocate of ideas he deeply believed in and knew to be crucially important: the abolition of the slave trade and the evolution of the political rights of the general public. Gillray’s caricatures and mockery don’t touch the substance of what Fox was trying to do or why he thought these things mattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John Major wasn’t the character the cartoons made him out to be. It is clearly not possible to become the leader of a large modern country without being at least extremely astute and intensely determined.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Like Fox, Major’s an example of a very general pain of being in a leadership position: you get misunderstood and misrepresented. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your flaws are on public display </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your flaws are visible and you won’t be able to do anything about them. You can’t turn you character around. And if you tried you’d get called out for doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6486473213_55ea866316_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7764" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6486473213_55ea866316_b.jpg?resize=635%2C631" alt="6486473213_55ea866316_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The complaints are unrealistic </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A complaint is made up of two distinct elements: Dissatisfaction + the belief the problem can be (easily) solved = complaint</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t complain when things feel inevitable or unavoidable. You can’t <em>complain</em> if it’s cold in Norway in winter or if Scotland fails to win the World Cup. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the leader &#8211; or manager or boss &#8211; the complications and difficulties that lie behind the problems are more apparent than they are to the employees. You become the lightning rod for free-floating dissatisfaction and envy. People will be mean not because you have done anything in particular to deserve their ire, but because you are the nearest available target. We can’t always work out very accurately why we are feeling bothered, frustrated, disappointed or short-tempered. But we need to have someone to blame: and the ideal target is someone who is nearby and who looks like they can take it: in other words, the leader. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: You have to become a poet </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may have trained in electrical engineering; your career may have recently focused on supply chain management. But at some point leadership is going to require you to become a poet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Morale </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason is to do with morale. One of the key issues in the history of warfare has been the power of morale. At critical moments in battle a single person turning to flee could lead to mass panic, while if one person shows confidence, whole mass of troops can follow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Tolstoy&#8217;s <em>War and Peace</em>, there’s a critical battle scene when one of his main characters, Prince Andrei, is engulfed in a flood of fleeing soldiers. Desperate to rally them, but alone, Andrei jumps off his horse, grabs the regimental flag and starts shouting and running forwards. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BZ6FaX.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7765" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BZ6FaX.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="BZ6FaX" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward and overtook him. A sergeant ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrei’s hands &#8211; but he was immediately killed. Andrei again seized the standard and, dragging it, ran on.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It works, the troops gain heart, regroup. It’s a moment that’s really important for Tolstoy to describe because he’s fascinated by the way small things can make a huge difference. He’s describing how the confidence of a leader can be transmitted to the followers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Morale depends not only on the confidence experienced at a specific moment but more broadly on the conviction that the undertaking is important, and honourable. At the extreme, people will stand in front of tanks, they will put their lives on the line because they believe that something is truly important. We feel committed and ready to make a sacrifice when someone has explained clearly enough why something is really worth doing. Company morale is pride in what is being done and your part in it, the belief that hard tasks can be completed, that it’s worth trying harder, that other people feel the same way and that you can rely on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Company morale is created by leaders &#8211; though it doesn’t need to be on the scale that take people into battle. It’s not going to involve literally shouting ‘forward lads’ and waving a banner. Instead, the modern leader needs to be a poet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What poetry is for</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry is the ambition of using words to get ideas into our imaginations, so that they influence our lives. It’s based on the realisation that how you present something matters hugely for its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Portrait-of-Horace-011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7780" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Portrait-of-Horace-011.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Portrait of Horace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman poet Horace identified two key features of good poetry. Poetry he said should be<em> dulce</em> and<em> utile</em>: that is, it should have <em>utility</em> and <em>sweetness.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Utility</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Useful means: that it addresses the problems a person actually has, that are in fact getting in the way. Usefulness depends upon a grasp of what it is that is giving someone trouble. As a generation living after the Romantic call that art should be just ‘for art’s sake,’ it’s surprising and invigorating to find a poet who wants poetry to do things in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Dulce &#8211; sweetness or attraction</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweetness means that it’s something you like: it’s attractive, alluring. You don’t have to try and force yourself to keep going (because you know that, despite the pain, it’s good for you).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>J.K. Rowling’s work is ‘sweet’ in the sense that Horace meant. Instead of parents and teachers trying to make children read, promising them rewards to read to the bottom of the page, they found that they couldn’t get certain children to stop reading. It was one of the unfortunately quite rare times when something very worthy (learning to read)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was also compulsively attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Horace’s ideas about poetry show why certain poems work so well. For instance, &#8220;They Fuck you Up&#8221; by Philip Larkin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/philip-larkin1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7767" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/philip-larkin1.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="philip-larkin1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They may not mean to, but they do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They fill you with the faults they had</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And add some extra, just for you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But they were fucked up in their turn</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>By fools in old-style hats and coats,<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who half the time were soppy-stern</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And half at one another’s throats.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its <em>usefulness</em> is that it says you can’t help it that your parents let you down and that they didn’t mean to, they couldn’t help. The failures of your parents were not a specific failing of them, but a sad and entrenched feature of the human condition. It’s not necessarily useful for everyone &#8211; but a lot of people DO need to hear this message again and again: they let you down, they didn’t mean to; their parents let them down;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if you have kids, you’ll let them down and you won’t mean to either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its <em>attraction</em> &#8211; it’s direct and swift and easy to remember. In fact, the opening two lines are now the best known lines of 20th century English poetry. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sweetness + usefulness = great poetry and great memos and power-point presentations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The leader needs to be a poet because they need to make the project of the company motivational; out of the millions of things they could say (the shareholders are pleased; our copper wiring is 3% cheaper than our rivals) they need to find the things that speak to the heart of the people they lead. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: You have to leave your old friends </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 19th century, when people immigrated, they knew that they would probably never see their old friends again. They were taking a step with major consequences. They were acutely conscious of the scale of what they were doing. They had sold their cottage; they had packed up all their belongings; they could feel the slow movement of the ship. They had a fourteen week journey before them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brown_last_of_england.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7768" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brown_last_of_england.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="Brown_last_of_england" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They knew there was no going back</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many steps in life which have a similar character &#8211; they take us to a new world from which we can’t return. But they are usually less overtly dramatic. And so the trauma is not so easily recognised &#8211; though we suffer just the same.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the pain of the process of maturation. When you become an adult you can’t ever really be a child again &#8211; though you will often be childish. You won’t ever again feel the complete ease that comes from the assured conviction other people will look after everything; perhaps climbing a tree will no longer feel like the most wonderful adventure in the world; a chair will never again be a sailing ship, or the space between your bed and the wardrobe, the Pacific ocean.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To become a leader is to undergo a change of this kind. Some earlier (and very nice) versions of oneself will have to be packed away. The sarcastic genius may not be coming back. The people you used to share a lot of good times with at work will think you’ve changed &#8211; and become more distant; you won’t be such fun to be around. You’ll seem colder. You’ll lack a sense of humour.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Four: You need to be like Jesus</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Irrespective of one’s religious beliefs, it’s clear that Jesus was one of the great leaders of all time. One of the main secrets was he united two characteristics that generally seem opposed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He was powerful</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The central idea of Christianity is that Jesus is the son of God and has immense power.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1">‘He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead’</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But at the same time… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He was one of us</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stories of the life of Jesus stress how normal and average he was in lots of way. His parents weren’t at all well off. Until he was thirty, he worked in his dad’s carpentry shop. One story told of how some of his supporters were making quite a long journey on foot to a place called Emmaus. Jesus joins them &#8211; in disguise. They chat with him, they talk about a lot of things. And they just think that he’s an ordinary, interesting man. It’s only when they get to their destination and have a meal, and Jesus blesses the bread in his special, characteristic way, that they recognise him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7774" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The great sellers of Religion &#8211; like the baroque painter Caravaggio &#8211; loved this story. They realised what a key selling point the ordinariness of Jesus was. You could sit down and have a meal with him. He had the same kind of worries and troubles as you. He understood, he knew what your life was like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea was that Jesus won the trust and loyalty of his followers at a very personal level. He didn’t simply impose or demand or assert his superiority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Jesus-type role (combining being ‘above’ and being ‘with’) is demanded by the modern workplace. To be effective, leadership has to be founded on personal trust. A great complaint about leadership is that the leader doesn’t understand, or has forgotten, or doesn’t care about what it is like for those lower down the system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just inherently difficult to be both of these things at once: to be intimate and also be in charge. Traditionally, these are distinct roles. We’re not especially cut out to do the two of them at the same time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People in authority who have understood the moral of Jesus’s story know how to do leadership and ordinariness.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When she takes public transport, the Queen of England is at one level doing a very normal thing. But because she does it, it is – of course – astonishing: because she could easily afford to go by helicopter, because she is the woman who was crowned in Westminster Abbey, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the sea, defender of the realm and of the faith.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Co7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7777" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Co7.jpg?resize=635%2C627" alt="BRITAIN-ROYALS-CORONATION-ANNIVERSARY-ROYAL-FILES" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Now she’s on the train in the seat next to me</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What touches us, even if we don’t usually spell it out, is that she is both the sovereign and a passenger at the same time, both extraordinary and normal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hierarchy is a deeply painful aspect of human society. There are good reasons why wholesale equality isn’t practical, but the longing for understanding and sympathy by the powerful towards the less powerful runs deep. That’s why it is deeply moving – and plain reassuring – if we see someone who could fly by helicopter take the train. It bodes well for the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We live in societies that are officially egalitarian and meritocratic. Yet we are endlessly exposed to massive differences in wealth, power, status and fame. We’re fascinated by the lives of top people. Yet we are troubled too. Do they understand? Do they know what it’s like? Any hints that they do are deeply significant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the Queen takes the train, she is bridging the world of history, grandeur, money and power – and the world of everyday life. The cynical (or just ambitious) voice might at this point say that there should only be average, normal, egalitarian things. But as this is unlikely to happen any time soon, what we desperately need is people at the top who properly understand their responsibilities towards the many. The Queen knows this, and that’s why she is rarely more appreciated than when she takes her place in a second class carriage of a provincial English train.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: You will be hated: Learn a lesson from the Home MBA</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s one arena where we don’t nowadays expect to learn very much that could be useful to us in the workplace: home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Home is meant to be a location for relaxation, sweetness and fun, a break from the arduousness of the office. Furthermore, in so far as there are children, modern parents are not expected to ‘lead’, merely to try to make life as pleasant as can be for young charges.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The notion of paternalism &#8211; of a more authoritative kind of domestic leadership &#8211; has become poisoned and the target of constant scepticism. When, in 1964, Bob Dylan sang to a generation of parents that &#8220;your sons and your daughters are beyond your command&#8221; (The Times They Are a-Changin&#8217;), he was counting on an instant recognition of the multiple failings of parental authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difficulty of parenthood is that one is asked to be the guardian of the long-term interests of someone who will be absolutely convinced, on multiple occasions, that one is deeply and viciously wrong (about the computer, the sleep-over, the car use…). And indeed one may be, which doesn’t preclude the need to come up with a plan and a principle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is always a matter of surprise to a new parent how much they can love their child and also, how weird it is to have to say ‘no’ to them &#8211; and then be the target of special hatred by someone they would lay down their life for. The role of a parent is a training ground in the inevitability of taking unpopular decisions &#8211; and in not expecting sympathy or gratitude for a very long time indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be 25 years until they understand why you took a certain decision &#8211; let alone grudgingly acknowledge there might have been a point to it.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern leaders and modern parents aren’t inclined to draw parallels between their activities; to think that &#8220;my children are my employees&#8221; and &#8220;my employees are my children.&#8221; Yet it’s mere squeamishness on our part that we don’t see domestic life as the training for the office (and for leadership roles especially) that it might be. There are MBAs to be earnt at the kitchen table and honed amidst the anguished screams around bedtime and teeth-brushing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a habit of stressing the benefits and understating the negatives of major development in life. Weddings generally exaggerate the joys of coupledom, becoming a parent is generally discussed only in its fulfilling and exciting aspects. It’s not that there are no good points, of course. It’s just that on their own they give an unhelpfully unrealistic account of what we’re getting into. They raise expectations too high. So by comparison, being married or being a parent is a let down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The risk is that we get very disenchanted and panicky when things turn out to be very much tougher than we’d anticipated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The position of being the boss, joining the leadership team or generally having more responsibility and power seems enviable. But as we’ve been seeing, it’s got considerable difficulties and troubles that come with it too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we assume that something ought to be quite easily within our grasp and not too difficult to do, we get panicked and worried if we suddenly find we’re having a very hard time. We think that there must be something particularly wrong with our characters, we fear we’re not cut out for the role, that we don’t have what it takes. But our feelings are not actually fair to ourselves. They are really caused by our initial expectations than by any special defect in ourselves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For much of history, the question was taken very seriously – and quite often the answer was a definite ‘yes’. A whole range of jobs were seen as incompatible with relationships. They weren’t necessarily saying you need to be chaste and avoid sex; it was the demands on time and the emotions that was the real focus of concern.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">St Hilda of Whitby was one of the most powerful and accomplished women in the early history of England.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7712" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="StHilda" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was a very senior administrator, running large agricultural enterprises; she was a management consultant to kings and princes. She was a leading educationalist. And she did all this while being noted for her good temper. Of course, she was unmarried. It’s not that because she was a nun she wasn’t allowed to get married and so had to make the best of her work opportunities without a supportive home life. The line of thought ran the other way round. She was able to have a stellar career and achieve so much for the community because she was free of the demands of relationships and domestic life. Being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a nun meant she lived in an efficient collective household – she would be supplied with meals, laundry and heating without having to organise everything for herself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was an approach to certain kinds of work – intellectual, administrative and cultural – that persisted for many centuries. In 1900, academia in the UK was still almost entirely a career for the unmarried.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7713" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="201011-formal-hall-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Fellows of King’s College, Cambridge in 1900: not being married was one of the job requirements</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The view was that certain kinds of jobs require such effort and continuous devotion and they loom so large in your imagination that you really shouldn’t try to combine them with the duties of a relationship, a family and looking after your own home. To do them properly, you should live in very well-organised commune (like a monastery or a college), you should be single and you should socialise mainly with people who are involved in the same kind of work, because they will understand you and also be able to help you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reminds us that we’re asking ourselves to do lots of complicated things at once. No wonder we squabble, feel resentment and the occasional burst of despair. We think it should be easy, if you’re a half-decent person, to be a success at work and an excellent domestic partner. But your job requires so much effort. Your sneaking background suspicion that someone who does your job might be too busy to empty the bins or make the bed could actually just be true. You deserve a lot of sympathy.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-006E688C00000258-88_634x423.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7673" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-006E688C00000258-88_634x423.jpg?resize=634%2C423" alt="dvt getty woman on plane with laptop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s 4.30pm, Thursday. The plane is still on the tarmac at Milan-Linate awaiting take off for the flight to Heathrow. Ellie makes herself open her laptop. Out of the window: the tail of an Airbus A320 shimmers in the afternoon light; a dark band of distant trees. The Tate and Lyle Environmental Compliance briefing document is going to need a lot of revision, after the discussions about the Brindisi plant. She drinks some mineral water. There’s another early start again in the morning. The person in the seat in front (just visible through the gap) is flicking through a magazine, licking their middle finger before turning a page. There are three emails about the Rotterdam contract and photos from her sister’s birthday dinner party last night, which she missed by about 939 miles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cabin steward offers a newspaper &#8211; she hasn’t time for it really, just for the <em>Guardian</em> headlines: the Mexican economy has failed to meet growth expectations, rape allegations are up in England and Wales; land disputes are triggering cast violence in India. A message from her partner: hey, did you make that change to the household insurance cover? <em>No, not yet!</em> (And can’t you stop fucking bugging me even when I’m on the plane!) The safety announcement starts. A guy Ellie was at college with got involved in property development, someone was saying he’s got his own plane.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At college she did a course on the Greeks and Romans, she hasn’t thought about the big sweep of history for ages. Why did her relationship with X run into the sand four years ago? Are these costing estimates right? She hasn’t had a moment to herself since she stepped out of the shower at 6.17am this morning. Since then, it’s been constant business. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s one of the many points where we feel: work has taken over. Things I’d like to be properly engaged with &#8211; including: my sister, pondering what I’m doing with my life, nature, reading novels &#8211; have been squeezed to the edges. Bluntly: work has ruined my life. It threatens my sanity, my relationships and my health. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Normally, we’d be expected to be a bit shamefaced at this point. Cracking up isn’t an acceptable thing to do. There’s a risk of sounding whiney, self-pitying or just a bit of a loser &#8211; not able to take the heat. We’re haunted by the idea that we should be able to juggle everything, with poise and good humour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Our imaginations are haunted by the image of more competent types, perhaps Larry Page.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-200214-pageA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7674" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-200214-pageA.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Media Summit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our own less satisfactory life must be due to our own failings. If we were cleverer, more efficient, more emotionally mature, more self-controlled … then everything would fall into place. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">HOW WORK THREATENS SANITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Personal troubles sometimes have big historical causes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our own lives, we typically see problems close up. There are lots of details that are getting us down. There’s too much to do. You fly off the handle over little things. You worry about affording a house. Your partner is too demanding. You’re not sleeping very well. You might wonder what it is all for, but there isn’t much time to wonder these days. You feel guilty about not getting proper exercise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We encounter the symptoms. But it’s hard for us to see if there’s a powerful causal factor that lies behind these localised frustrations and annoyances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We understand this distinction between symptoms and causes in medical situations: someone might have a pain in their big toe and dry peeling skin. The natural instinct is to think: there’s something very wrong with my toe, because that’s where the pain is occurring. But the problem isn’t caused there. There’s something wrong with their kidneys leading to a buildup of urate crystals in the toe joint.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-102726438.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-102726438.jpg?resize=635%2C568" alt="Housewife doing the laundry whilst smoking, 1954." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 1960s, feminism took off by making this same move: finding a big, underlying factor that explained a lot of personal gripes and annoyances. In the late 1950s, women across the US might think things like: my husband is a bit selfish; I wish I could have an interesting job and make decent money myself; I was a fool I should have worked harder at college, but I didn’t see the point at the time; I’m not even sure I want children &#8211; does that mean there’s something wrong with me? I feel frustrated every day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1963, Betty Friedan argued that all of these complaints &#8211; which could seem like merely individual personal grievances &#8211; were in fact symptoms of a bigger issue which up to this point people hadn’t identified: it was, in her words, &#8220;the problem that has no name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning [that is, a longing] that women suffered in the middle of the 20th century in the United States. Each suburban housewife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries … she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — &#8216;Is this all?'&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1971BettyMarch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7677" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1971BettyMarch.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="1971BettyMarch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Betty Friedan: <em>it’s not you </em></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Betty Friedan reframed the issue: what’s going on isn’t really just a local difficulty with your life. It’s not something specific about your particular relationship or your career options. You are suffering from a big historical problem. And she gave it a name: Patriarchy. She was pointing out that women were feeling the effects of living in a society that had evolved to focus on male authority and opportunity. Women were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>being given access to a really big story about the origins of their sufferings (big and small). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe that the suffering of the lawyer on the plane (in whose troubles we all share to a greater or lesser extent) should also be attributed to a large historical cause. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this case, the problem lies with: <em>Modernism.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modernism is the name of a phenomenon that captivated artists and writers from the middle of the 19th century. Starting in Paris and spreading to Vienna, London and New York, architects, poets, painters and novelists started responding to the vast expansion of cities, the arrival of the railways, the huge increase in newspapers and the amount of advertising that was going on all around them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/La_Gare_Saint-Lazare.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7678" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/La_Gare_Saint-Lazare.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="La_Gare_Saint-Lazare" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, in its more ambitious forms, Modernism didn’t just reflect a new subject matter: painting busy streets rather than scenes from the bible or ancient history. Avant-garde artists started developing new styles &#8211; they changed <em>the way</em> they painted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They went from highly-esteemed traditional works, like those of Claude Lorraine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that emphasised harmony and balance </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ng_ng_ng61_large.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7679" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ng_ng_ng61_large.jpg?resize=635%2C664" alt="(c) The National Gallery, London; Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To things like Georges Braque’s 1913 <strong>Cubist</strong> still life: <em>Fruit Dish, Ace of Clubs</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Georges_Braque_1913_Nature_morte_Fruit_Dish_Ace_of_Clubs_oil_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas_81_x_60_cm_31.8_x_23.6_in_Musée_National_dArt_Moderne_Centre_Georges_Pompidou_Paris.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7682" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Georges_Braque_1913_Nature_morte_Fruit_Dish_Ace_of_Clubs_oil_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas_81_x_60_cm_31.8_x_23.6_in_Musée_National_dArt_Moderne_Centre_Georges_Pompidou_Paris.jpg?resize=635%2C625" alt="Georges_Braque,_1913,_Nature_morte_(Fruit_Dish,_Ace_of_Clubs),_oil,_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas,_81_x_60_cm_(31.8_x_23.6_in),_Musée_National_d'Art_Moderne,_Centre_Georges_Pompidou,_Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Braque and his colleague Picasso were in the process of inventing Cubism. Cubist works struck early viewers as hard to understand, as too busy and broken up. But Braque and Picasso weren’t setting out to annoy people. They were signalling that something very important was happening, that life was getting more agitated, more fragmented, more sharp-edged. They started making images that reflected just these qualities.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar changes were taking place at the same time in literature. Traditional narrative was leisurely and clear. A very successful traditional novelist like Anthony Trollope would take care to let the reader know about what was happening. Reading a Trollope novel would be a calm, comfortable experience; maybe very slightly tedious, but definitely reassuring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Mr. Wharton was and had for a great many years been a barrister practising in the Equity Courts,—or rather in one Equity Court, for throughout a life&#8217;s work now extending to nearly fifty years, he had hardly ever gone out of the single Vice-Chancellor&#8217;s Court which was much better known by Mr. Wharton&#8217;s name than by that of the less eminent judge who now sat there. His had been a very peculiar, a very toilsome, but yet probably a very satisfactory life. He had begun his practice early, and had worked in a stuff gown till he was nearly sixty. At that time he had amassed a large fortune, mainly from his profession, but partly also by the careful use of his own small patrimony and by his wife&#8217;s money. Men knew that he was rich, but no one knew the extent of his wealth.&#8221; [Trollope: <em>The Prime Minister</em>] </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Literary Modernism rejected this approach. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/joyce_abbott.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7681" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/joyce_abbott.jpg?resize=400%2C500" alt="joyce_abbott" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In chapter seven of his novel <em>Ulysses</em> &#8211; first published as a whole in 1922 &#8211; James Joyce describes one of the main characters, Leopold Bloom, walking into a Dublin newspaper office: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thumping. Thump. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake&#8217;s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby&#8217;s page for tiny tots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understandably, sceptical readers at first simply thought that Joyce was hopeless at telling a story. It’s hard to follow what’s going on: it seems to be a jumble of stray thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In fact, he had a serious purpose: he was trying to reproduce what he saw as the chaos of modern experience. What’s going on inside our heads has become &#8211; he says &#8211; more like this: agitated, distracted, confusing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to consider Modernism as an artistic, cultural movement. We need to rediscover it as something useful to us on the flight home, something that reflects the most troubling aspects of our inner lives in the contemporary world. Artists like Joyce and Braque are tracking a development that’s still going on in our own lives: the loss of serenity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three deep causes of this loss of serenity: busy-ness, competition and envy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism One: Busy-ness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we’re expected to be always on the job. The idea of having precisely defined working hours no longer feels normal or natural. Essentially, you are not at work when work can reach you. If you can’t get out of range, you can’t ever really be away from work. Busy-ness depends upon how easy it is to get a claim on your attention and make a demand. Busyness has been increasing for centuries because of developments in the technology of access. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In early 18th-century Scotland, you might turn up in mid-summer at someone’s house &#8211; hoping to get them to do some work for you &#8211; only to be informed that they had ‘gone to London’ and that they would be ‘back by Christmas’. But if there was anything urgent that needed doing, you could always travel ten days and nights in a coach in pursuit of them. Or you could send a letter: it would take 110 hours and cost two-shillings &#8211; two days average wages. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But soon things got faster and cheaper. Technology got more sophisticated. By 1840, a letter would only take 33 hours and cost a penny (about GBP 5 today). However, if your quarry had gone overseas, they would be out of reach for weeks or months. At least, until 1866 when the first successful telegraph cable was laid across the Atlantic; though if they went to Australia they were safe until October 1872. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telex.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7684" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telex.jpg?resize=635%2C587" alt="Telex" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the 1930s onwards, the telex meant that work could follow you. Extensive documents and files could follow you round the globe, so you would never have the excuse of not having the relevant material to hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But the telex system was expensive and required special operators so there were restrictions on its use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By 1993, email solved those problems &#8211; reducing the cost of communication to almost zero. Though you could very reasonably say that you didn’t get the email because you were on a train, at the airport or because you had stepped out of the office to have lunch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until 2007, that is, when the smartphone became mainstream. There are now few moments when one is legitimately beyond reach: in the shower perhaps &#8211; though there are very good waterproof cases. Or you could spend time in Big Bend National Park in Texas, where there is, as yet, almost no satellite coverage.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The history of communications can be told as a success story, of course. But it is also the record of the gradual conquest of privacy. We used to be protected by the impediments. People simply couldn’t make demands on us &#8211; not matter how much they might have wanted to. We’re not used to thinking of what the upside of impediments used to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism Two: Competition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, competition is a key feature of the modern economy. Competition has been fostered by governments around the world because of the benefits it typically brings to customers and consumers: lower prices and a wider range of products. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 20th century, the most influential advocate of Competition was the Austrian economist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Friedrich Hayek. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Friedrich_Hayek.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7686" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Friedrich_Hayek.jpg?resize=635%2C564" alt="Friedrich_Hayek" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The intellectual architect of glitzy malls</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Competition is designed to benefit the customer, rather than the company. And the reward is that when we go to buy things, we are offered lower prices and a wider range of options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost comes in our working lives. Greater competition makes companies fight to win sales. Customers should be very fickle. They should have a lot of choice and be very willing to go with the better deal, wherever it comes from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies have to strive to lower their prices or offer better, more enticing products. A firm that stands still will be overtaken by a more innovative or more efficient rival. Competition &#8211; ideally &#8211; keeps profits in check. If a firm has a bumper year and makes a big profit that should send a clear invitation to rival firms to move in, undercut, reduce the margins. A so-called efficient market really means one where it becomes ever more challenging to make a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Internal competition in companies makes employees compete against one another. The successful may be well rewarded but there’s a permanent cull of the less efficient. And competition should also mean that many companies fail. A really efficient marketplace should be a really stressful place to work &#8211; because you’re always afraid of going out of business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3979173651_a1afca6b86_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7688" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3979173651_a1afca6b86_z.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="3979173651_a1afca6b86_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have bought our happiness as consumers at the price of ourselves as producers. We had the option of running the economy for the sake of the worker or the consumer. The idea of ourselves as consumers dominated over the image of ourselves as workers. The huge collateral cost is that everyone at work is stressed. Efficiency brings anxiety, punishing hours and insecurity into the workplace. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things that are familiar tend to feel natural. But actually it’s very odd that people in executive jobs are working so hard. History reminds us how much beyond the normal level we are operating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The philosopher John Stuart Mill worked in London for a vastly powerful business &#8211; the East India Company &#8211; from 1823 to 1858. He was mainly involved in policy formation and finished his career in one of the most senior roles: his job title was ‘The Examiner’. It was a highly responsible position; Mill was often required to give evidence on behalf of the Company before Parliamentary Committees. And he was very well paid. The job carried a salary of GBP 2000 &#8211; more than 20 times the average income. But while employed by the East India Company, Mill also managed to write some major and highly influential<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>philosophical works &#8211; including, amongst many others, two monumental works:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>A System of Logic</em> (1843) and <em>The Principles of Political Economy</em> (1848). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mill was able to do all this because most afternoons, the East India Company’s offices were quiet. He could sit at his desk and get on with his own projects. Nobody was angry with him for doing so. If anything they were impressed by his work ethic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-173340148.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7689" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-173340148.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="John Stuart Mill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">John Stuart Mill by Gilbert Keith Chesterton. The accompanying verse reads &#8220;John Stuart Mill / By a mighty effort of will / Overcame his natural bonhomie / And wrote &#8216; Principles of Political Economy.&#8221;</h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Stuart Mill</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">By an effort of will</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Abandoned his natural bonhomie</span></h5>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">[The image and verse [improved by us] are by GK Chesterton; Getty images]</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his report for the UK government’s 1864 School Enquiry Commission, the poet and civil servant Matthew Arnold advised the adoption in England of the workload for teachers in France: &#8220;A teacher at a French Lycée has his three four or five hours a day in lessons and conferences, then he is free.&#8221; He was specifically arguing against the practice in the England of school teachers working a few hours a week on top of this, supervising games. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arnold and Mill &#8211; who were immensely respectable figures &#8211; show us that it was completely normal in the professional world of the mid-19th century to work around 20 hours a week. These were not people who were lazy or marginal in their careers. They used their free time in very constructive and ambitious ways. That’s why it was possible for the leading philosopher to be in business and for one of the major poets to work as a senior administrative officer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caricature-of-matthew-arnold.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7690" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caricature-of-matthew-arnold.jpg?resize=527%2C514" alt="caricature-of-matthew-arnold" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some ways, we are simply unlucky to be living at this moment of intense commercial competition. In general, the idea of historical bad luck makes a lot of sense: people’s lives just happen to get played out against the background of huge events. 1938 was an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>unfortunate time to turn 21.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TGSE00788.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7691" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TGSE00788.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="TGSE00788" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Good natured sympathetic innocence meeting with a really horrible historical movement</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We understand that certain times were hard. The challenge today isn’t so concentrated and dramatic. But when you notice the difference between the life of Stuart Mill and us, it is extraordinary (that’s before we even mention housing and what a middle-class salary would have bought in London then and now). Mill and Arnold were able to hold down very good, high-level jobs for many years, but they faced nothing like the pressure and anxiety we have to live with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just that a particular firm is very demanding or that one’s own shortcomings lead to weariness and insecurity:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it’s the larger dynamic of market capitalism. Competition is why lunch for the lawyer on the plane usually means two minutes for a sandwich at the desk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism Three: Comparison, Envy and Disappointment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle ages, if you lived in Bristol (which was then a busy but small sea port), you probably wouldn’t know much about what was happening in London, Paris or the royal courts of Spain. Less urgent information might simply never circulate around the country: that the ladies at court like to gather their hair up in net bags either side of their face; that they like red gauntlets sewn with pearls in floral patterns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7692" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363.jpg?resize=635%2C610" alt="456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Blanche of Lancaster &#8211; wife of Henry IV &#8211; was the best dressed woman in late 14th-century England. But she couldn’t be<em> fashionable</em> &#8211; because it took too long for people to find out about what she was wearing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The daughter of a well-to-do merchant in Bristol might take a great deal of interest in clothes, but she couldn’t compare herself with the grander ladies of London like Blanche &#8211; because she simply didn’t know what they were up to. And, in any case, Blanche hardly seemed to belong to the same species. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, in August 1770, the first edition of the <em>Lady’s Magazine</em> appeared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7693" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e.jpg?resize=635%2C545" alt="2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every month it carried detailed illustrations of what the most prestigious women were wearing. So news about bonnets and high waists could circulate rapidly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Satellite.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7694" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Satellite.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="No. 4. 1811 London Fashionable Morning &amp; Evening Dress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone reading it could at last compare their own clothes with those of the rich and well-connected in London. And so they were provided with the opportunity of experiencing a novel emotion: the feeling of being left out by history, by fashion, by everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up until then you could be left out, of course &#8211; but only by people who you knew, who lived around you. Your cousins didn’t take you berry-picking; the vicar didn’t ask you to dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The magazine, however, presented itself as revealing what every lady in the land was was wearing &#8211; except you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Actually ‘the Lady’ was not the disembodied voice of the spirit of the age speaking with universal authority. It was mainly concocted by a man called John Coote in a dusty little office, in an unprepossessing corner of London. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new media of the 18th century was also teaching men the pains of missing out and being left behind: a yeoman farmer could learn from <em>The Spectator</em> that he was a clodhopper; <em>The Tatler</em> encouraged a local squire to recognise himself as a dull provincial. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The growth of modern technology created the opportunity for comparison. It needed better roads, more efficient printing, the use of special-coloured inks, an effective postal service to get a copy of the <em>Lady’s Magazine</em> into the hands of people in Newcastle and Exeter. And comparison opened the way to envy and disappointment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 18th century was introducing the world to the distinctive modern experience of comparison. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7695" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263.jpg?resize=400%2C570" alt="Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Officially, we are simply finding out about the world: we are informing ourselves about the lives of others &#8211; their style and achievements. We evolved as social creatures living in large groups: we’re<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>primed by nature to be very interested in social hierarchies. It seem innocuous: an article about the most chic ski resort in Europe; a photo shoot of a young woman with amazingly beautiful legs; the new trend for rooftop lap-pools and a profile of how Uber’s Travis Kalanick made his billions. It’s just information about what’s happening around the world, but what it’s doing in our head is very harmful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Envy is dependent on knowledge and hope. We only envy things that feel as if they are within our reach. Yet the world of the magazine is highly selective. In the magazine, ‘everyone’ is fashionable, everyone seems to have plenty of money, is aged between 18 and 25 and has a perfectly-shaped nose. Our natural instinct for comparison goes haywire as a result. By the standards of the magazine world, we are barely acceptable, we are on the lowest rung. We come away with a nagging sense of being plain, dowdy and short of cash. The life we lead &#8211; which used to seem fine &#8211; now looks so disappointing, because it compares so unfavourably with the picture of existence conjured up in the media. And so we are required to continually fight an internal battle staving off the envy and humiliation provoked by overexposure to the lives of the freakishly successful and beautiful few.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">History dignifies our problems </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking at three big factors in Modernism &#8211; the rise of busy-ness, the growth of competition and the vast increase in the circulation of envy-inducing information &#8211; shows that our problems around work are not the result of personal failings. This doesn’t make the problem go away. What it does is transform its meaning. History helps us reframe what we’re going through. It guides the re-interpretation of our own experience. You understand your problem in non-hysterical, non-panicky ways. There are three specific consolations of history: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It depersonalises</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However intimate it all feels -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the exhaustion, the relationship tension, the build up of demands, the ever increasing expectations &#8211; the fact is that one is not alone. Because these troubles arise out of big historical factors, they are necessarily going to be very widespread. You belong to a community of people who have this problem. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It shifts the direction of blame </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us not to shout at the wrong person. It’s not your fault. And it’s not just some stupid managerial issue that’s getting you down. We can grasp why the problem won’t go away quickly or easily &#8211; why just changing jobs or getting divorced won’t necessarily solve the issue. History offers an insight into potentially mitigating factors around work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Participation in the Grandeur of History </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real root of your problem is not the Frankfurt contracts, it’s this high-cultural issue known as Modernism. In general, we understand how much it can mean to people to see themselves in grand historical terms. Mourners at the funeral of Winston Churchill &#8211; which took place at the end of January 1965 &#8211; knew they were recognising more than the death of a single individual. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7696" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were collectively witnessing the passing of an epoch. The Grandeur of History isn’t only about positive things which are shared. There is grandeur in recognising the scale of the collective traumas we go through together; they are so much bigger than us; they set the stage on which we lead our lives, we have no control over them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We haven’t yet raised all the monuments we need: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Arc de Triomphe gets us to see the grandeur of the huge, painful transformation of France during the Revolution.

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OUR WORK &amp; OUR PARTNERS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work threatens to blow up our relationships. There are four key complaints that signal the mounting levels of tension. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint One: If you loved me, you wouldn’t work so hard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So often, work has a difficult impact on relationships. (Though the absence of work can be even worse). There’s a long list of complaints: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you’re never around</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you’re always tired</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– I never get you full attention; you’re obsessive; your work always comes first (I wanted to watch an episode of <em>House of Cards</em> with you at 10pm and you were still bashing away at a report) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you come back stressed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Ideology of Romanticism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we tend to see our relationships in terms that were invented mainly in the late 18th century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Romantic ideology of love emphasises: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– monogamy, sex as the expression of love</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– candour, the sharing of all secrets</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– the need to understand one another</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– the importance of doing things together all the time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These ideas were revolutionary when they were introduced. And they were introduced by very particular kinds of people: who were young, leisured, well-off. Romanticism was invented on long summer evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/517715075_f829f4f414_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7701" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/517715075_f829f4f414_z.jpg?resize=635%2C321" alt="517715075_f829f4f414_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The main manual of Romanticism &#8211; the book that more than any other taught people how to think of love in this way &#8211; was <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>. It was written by the German poet and philosopher Goethe, when he was in his mid-twenties. It tells the story of Werther’s love for Charlotte. He meets her at a dance and falls in love with her. Every emotional shift is described in compelling detail: the thrill of looking into her eyes, the agony that she does not love him back, the desperate longing to see her again after every parting, the moments of transcendent tenderness. For thirty years it was the most famous novel in the world (Napoleon read it seven times). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As his love for Charlotte grows, Werther is not distracted by the demands of a job. At one point, Werther describes how he usually passes the morning &#8211; before going over to Charlotte’s place for the afternoon and evening. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;In the morning at sunrise I go out to gather with my own hands the peas which are to serve for my dinner, I sit down to shell them,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>read some poetry during the intervals, and then, selecting a saucepan from the kitchen, fetch my own butter, put it on the fire, cover it up, and sit down to stir it as occasion requires.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11-goethe-werther-granger.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7700" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/11-goethe-werther-granger.jpg?resize=635%2C350" alt="11-goethe-werther-granger" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Werter reading to Charlotte. He was next expected at work in two-and-a-half years</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a while Werther does have a job: he takes up a rather undemanding post as a diplomat. But for months on end he’s free to do as he likes. It’s not a coincidence. Romantic love began as a full time undertaking. It was invented as a privileged, leisured experience. The ideal romantic couple would spend all their time together, they would spend hours talking about every detail of their emotional lives, they would always be going on long walks together in the evening. And the point of getting married would be to be able to do this more and more. Any reduction in the time spent together or lessening of the level of openness would be experienced in very alarming terms: it would begin to signal the death of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Romanticism meets Modern Capitalism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romanticism and Capitalism are the two dominant system of ideas of our time: they guide the way we think and feel about the two things the usually matter most in our lives: relationships and work. But combining Romanticism and Modern Capitalism together is very, very difficult. It’s a hugely unfortunate historical clash. We live under two very powerful, but oddly incompatible systems. The impressive idea of Romantic love &#8211; with its ideals of closeness and openness &#8211; sits badly with the way work takes up so much of our time, fills our heads with complex demands and makes it very hard to switch off; and the insecurity around so much work makes it very hard to feel relaxed about taking things easy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The aristocratic tradition of marriage </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern view of work should ideally have been married up with the view of relationships that predominated in the French and English aristocracy up until the end of the 18th century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7702" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A happy unromantic couple: John (far left) and Sarah (middle) with their children</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The John 1st Duke and Sarah Duchess of Marlborough had a very strong marriage. They were the most successful economic and political couple in early 18th-century Europe, whose partnership took them from obscure poverty to vast wealth and power. But they spent long periods apart. Neither one was particularly surprised if they didn’t see the other for six months. And the idea of sexual fidelity did not apply. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Their expectations of a relationship were clear, limited and pragmatic. They would produce legitimate heirs. They would secure mutual prosperity and assist each other’s careers. They could have moments of great loyalty and closeness &#8211; but it wasn’t an everyday thing. They were not expected to share the same bedroom, or even live in the same house all the time. They weren’t continually complaining about not spending enough time together or about being too occupied with work. But nor were they doing something strange and unusual. The way they lived was conventional and acceptable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t realise to what an extent our feelings are guided by our sense of what is normal and of what we should expect from others. We are highly flexible creatures, but with a generally strong desire to fit in. There are many ways we could be living fine &#8211; if we had time to adjust and enough social support. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a revolution in marriage &#8211; from the current Romantic version to an updated version of the pragmatic, work-aligned<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aristocratic idea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint Two: I don’t know what’s on your mind</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic vision of love is very keen on candour and sharing: according to the Romantic ideal, your lover is sensitive to and understands your moods and thoughts: you finish each other’s sentences; each knows what the other has on their mind. It can be a very attractive idea &#8211; but the level of communicative openness it assumes is at odds with the realities of a lot of modern work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It’s hard to explain what’s going on at work</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s hard to get your partner to really understand what your experience is like (and they may very likely be feeling the same way about you and their work). After a tricky day (or a tricky week) the tension has built up; the worries are circulating, work-related ideas fill one’s mind. All this preoccupation expresses itself in a range of not very endearing symptoms: grunting, sighing, brooding silence and a short-fused temper. The most innocuous sounding question ’how was your day?’ can elicit a growl or an explosion; a tiny irritation at home feels like this: one is already filled up with stress and irritation; a single drop more and a spill is inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One’s partner has to endure these symptoms without the real cause being properly explained. They can’t see all the stuff that is in the glass already. We find it extremely hard to lay out what has actually been going on at work in such a way that would lead the other person to understand what we’re going though &#8211; and therefore feel a degree of sympathy for our volatile state. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we find it extremely difficult to undertake the expected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>explanation. It’s not really our fault. There are several big reasons why this is the case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Description in general is hard </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work isn’t unusual in being hard to describe. The fact that something is very familiar to you doesn’t mean it is at all easy to put into words what it is like or what is going on. Bicycle gears are totally rational mechanisms for controlling the relationship between the speed the pedals are rotating at and the speed the wheels are turning. Describing in detail what is going on is fiendishly difficult (and very boring).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closeup_bicycle_gears_alex.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7704" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closeup_bicycle_gears_alex.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="closeup_bicycle_gears_alex" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Impossible to put into words: like so much of work</h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Previously expectations of communication were much lower</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that explanation is tricky didn’t matter so much when expectations were low. When work was strongly divided on gender lines, there was often an assumption that work wouldn’t be much discussed at home, in a domestic setting. Family life was where the worker left work behind. The family didn’t feel shut out. It felt natural and therefore totally acceptable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in any case, jobs were often much simpler and their basic character was well understood by everyone. If you were a shepherd, a blacksmith, a miner or a housemaid, you were doing work that had been deeply familiar to everyone in the community for many generations. The advent of the factory system in the early 19th century brought new kinds of work &#8211; but often whole communities would be employed in roughly the same industries, so everyone would understand what it was like to glaze pottery (if you lived in Staffordshire) or operate a steam loom (if you lived around Manchester). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today’s jobs are weirder and more strangely specialised. You might be </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– advising on restructuring the billing system for an NHS trust; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a senior order entry specialist scheduling shipments to customers; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– involved in the operational management of health and welfare benefit programs;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a technical manager with extensive experience in IBM Data Collection suite, including Dimensions, with a track record in leading systems transformation projects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instructively, grown-up characters in children’s books rarely have such jobs. They are still more likely to be farmers, deliver the post or have a grocery stall at the local market &#8211; work that is essentially pre-modern. This tiny detail of modern publishing has a larger meaning: it’s a signal that we know that it’s very hard to explain modern jobs to a child, or indeed anyone else. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One’s work situation is changing fast… </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work is often like a fast moving, many stranded soap opera, with revolving characters and volatile themes. Keeping one’s partner on board would require constant updating:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The other Sarah &#8211; not the one I was telling you about yesterday who had the fight with the New York office over the legal reforms in Argentina, but the<em> other</em> one &#8211; who I mentioned two weeks ago when she was trying to get Ted &#8211; remember Ted? &#8211; to take Alison off the review committee. You’re with me? So, other Sarah was suggesting that I rejig the approach to the Générale Occidentale account. For once, she’s actually got a point. But it means I’m going to be working late on Tuesday. Now, let me fill you in on the apparently subtle, but actually fundamental, shift in our strategy toward the French financial services sector&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Explaining properly -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>about why one day was more demanding than another, why a particular project is so stress-inducing or why the relationship with certain people involves special degrees of angst &#8211; would require immense levels of patience on both sides. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It would help if… </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">There was general acknowledging that the explanatory task is very difficult. </span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Theoretical physicists have it easy to the extent that everyone admits that their work is important and yet bafflingly difficult for outsiders to understand. If we don’t understand we don’t blame them. We humbly admit it’s all just too complicated. We need this tolerance to spread more widely. So that one could comfortably say things like: ‘my partner is in logistics; of course their work is too complex for me to understand properly.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Art could take up some of the burden</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In late 19th century England, the best understood work was that of a country vicar. This was due not to the simplicity of their work (it was actually quite complicated) but to the great efforts to explain it undertaken by the most accomplished novelists of the age. George Eliot and Anthony Trollope wrote numerous highly successful and highly accomplished works detailing the working lives of the Church of England clergy. They explained in great detail (but in ways that won them huge audiences) the secret pains and quiet triumphs of such work.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Anthony Trollope &#8211; the leading 19th-century writer of entertaining novels &#8211; was determined to make the world understand the day-to-day working lives of Anglican vicars</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We haven’t yet seen this happen around more typical modern employment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint: I have to do all the shit work around here/I’m tired of picking up your socks</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the ways work is at odds with domestic life is expressed via intemperate conversations about who cleans the loo. (Or takes out the rubbish, or renews the household insurance or cleans the fridge.) It’s partly because when people are busy with job work there’s less time and energy left over for work around the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The modern ideology of work assigns the domestic sphere a low status</em>. Work around the house isn’t paid, and that means it can’t be important. And it’s associated, historically, with socially subordinate positions: the scullery maid, the footman. So, we tend not to take household management seriously. We don’t give it patient and serious thought. We’re not used to recognising and admiring the relevant skills. (We admire people who can drive fast, but not those who can make a bed perfectly at high-speed.) In Modernity, paid work has sucked up all the prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>And our Romantic ideas about love are also not very concerned with household management</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dicksee-romeo_and_juliet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7709" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dicksee-romeo_and_juliet.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="dicksee-romeo_and_juliet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">No one is worrying about who dusted the shelves</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Romantic ideology privileges emotion over household management. It’s the intensity of the feeling the couple has for each other that counts &#8211; not the extent to which they can co-operate around cleaning the bathroom or managing the household accounts. If one were to ask is vacuuming more romantic than a weekend in Paris the answer &#8211; supposedly is too obvious to be worth giving. And yet a collaborative attitude to cleaning rugs is a better indicator of the health of a relationship than a shared interest in bars in the troisième. The irony is we play down the domestic as if it didn’t matter &#8211; yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>actually this is where things so often get very fraught in relationships. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">An unfortunate historical moment … </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We live at a moment that is quite odd by historical standards: a period when pretty much everyone is involved (even if only a little) in housework. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we tend to think of the idea of having a servant as an ultra-high end luxury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/contents-butler.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7710" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/contents-butler.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Room Service" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But for large swathes of humanity, very large numbers of people in fact employed other people to help them domestically. In 1850 in the UK, for example, families with an income of GBP 300 a year (the basic income of any managerial job) would typically have two live-in servants. A clerk on half that (GBP 150 a year) would usually employ a full-time maid. Even just renting a room almost always meant having a shared servant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The domestic service sector really came to an end because there were more productive things for people to do. In the most productive economies it has become prohibitively expensive to employ a fellow citizen to live in your house and make you cups of tea, dust the mantlepiece and clean the bath taps. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in the future, it is unlikely that there will be much domestic work for people to do (unless they want to do it for fun). The technological developments of the 1950s and 1960s – the vacuum cleaners and dishwashers and tumble driers – made domestic work a bit less cumbersome, but they didn’t bring it to an end. The long-promised robotic servants who really would take domestic chores out of our hands haven’t arrived yet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-008438AE00000258-160_468x306.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7711" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-008438AE00000258-160_468x306.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="F-CTF19313" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, of course, they will become standard &#8211; eventually. They might be cheap and common by 2050. So there will have been a gap period from about 1950 to 2050 where domestic work was neither the province of servants nor of robots. A century is nothing in the big sweep of history. It’s just odd and very challenging that we happen to be living in it at the moment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint: You’re too busy for me</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both partners are tired and depleted. She wants him to see her friends. He wants her to do some complicated sexual thing. They’re too tired to please each other. And they each have what feels like a justified point of complaint against the other: you’re too busy for me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> People feel guilty; they feel they should go to bed earlier. Perhaps if they took magnesium supplements, they’d feel more perky. But the real cause is probably just work: too much, too demanding, too relentless. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We’ve been very reluctant to admit that the demands of certain areas of high-pressure modern work might really not be very compatible with having a relationship. In order to get on efficiently with other tasks, you probably shouldn’t be trying to have a relationship and possibly raise a family as well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which raises a question that sounds deeply strange to us: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Might you really need to be celibate to do certain jobs? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For much of history, the question was taken very seriously &#8211; and quite often the answer was a definite ‘yes’. A whole range of jobs were seen as incompatible with relationships. They weren’t necessarily saying you need to be chaste and avoid sex; it was the demands on time and the emotions that was the real focus of concern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">St Hilda of Whitby was one of the most powerful and accomplished women in the early history of England.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7712" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="StHilda" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was a very senior administrator, running large agricultural enterprises; she was a management consultant to kings and princes. She was a leading educationalist. And she did all this while being noted for her good temper. Of course, she was unmarried. It’s not that because she was a nun she wasn’t allowed to get married and so had to make the best of her work opportunities without a supportive home life. The line of thought ran the other way round. She was able to have a stellar career and achieve so much for the community because she was free of the demands of relationships and domestic life. Being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a nun meant she lived in an efficient collective household &#8211; she would be supplied with meals, laundry and heating without having to organise everything for herself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It was an approach to certain kinds of work &#8211; intellectual, administrative and cultural &#8211; that persisted for many centuries. In 1900, academia in the UK was still almost entirely a career for the unmarried.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7713" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="201011-formal-hall-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Fellows of King’s College, Cambridge in 1900: not being married was one of the job requirements</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The view was that certain kinds of jobs require such effort and continuous devotion and they loom so large in your imagination that you really shouldn’t try to combine them with the duties of a relationship, a family and looking after your own home. To do them properly, you should live in very well-organised commune (like a monastery or a college), you should be single and you should socialise mainly with people who are involved in the same kind of work, because they will understand you and also be able to help you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reminds us that we’re asking ourselves to do lots of complicated things at once. No wonder we squabble, feel resentment and the occasional burst of despair. We think it should be easy, if you’re a half-decent person, to be a success at work and an excellent domestic partner. But your job requires so much effort. Your sneaking background suspicion that someone who does your job might be too busy to empty the bins or make the bed could actually just be true. You deserve a lot of sympathy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CHILDREN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Accompanied by a discrete but substantial security detail, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, likes to take his daughter Florence to nursery school a few blocks from Number 10.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, he’d do it every day. But the demands on his diary make it a rare event. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-040214-cameronA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7714" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-040214-cameronA.jpg?resize=635%2C597" alt="Prime Minister David Cameron" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sadly, a special occasion</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Historically, it is very odd for Prime Ministers &#8211; or indeed anyone with an executive role &#8211; to spend much of their day attending to the needs of their own children.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>People weren’t heartless, they just didn’t think that it was particularly good for children to spend a lot of time with their parents. Many people feared ‘spoiling’ their children by overt displays of affection. In fact, it wasn’t until the early 1950s that this view started to change dramatically. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A number of researchers in the area of child development &#8211; especially an English doctor and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby &#8211; stressed the importance of continuous and close relationships with parents. He demonstrated the value of a warm, reassuring parental figure for the good development of the child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Bowlby.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7716" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Bowlby.jpg?resize=635%2C627" alt="John-Bowlby" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;All the cuddling and playing, the intimacies of suckling by which a child learns the comfort of his mother’s body, the rituals of washing and dressing by which through her pride and tenderness towards his little limbs he learns the values of his own…&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such experiences teach a basic trust: that difficulties can be managed; that slip-ups are only that and can be put right, that we are naturally entitled to be treated with kindness and consideration, without having to do anything to earn this and without having to make special pleas or demands. &#8220;It is as if maternal care were as necessary for the proper development of personality as vitamin D for the proper development of bones.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He didn’t mean for it to happen, but Bowlby’s insights into the principles of child development opened a new landscape of pain for modern parents. One is upset and worried about not making it back in time to read for bed. A tender part of us has been awakened and now aches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The parent returning from a business trip frets at the nights they have missed bath time, the number of bed-time stories they didn’t read. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are worries which would not have occurred to a knight returning from the Crusades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1095 &#8211; when his son Baldwin was two &#8211; Count Robert of Flanders, headed overseas on the First Crusade to the Holy Land. He came back home<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in August 1099. By which time he had missed 1,460 successive bedtime stories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31.jpg?resize=400%2C337" alt="300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>\</p>
<h5 class="p1">Robert: unfazed by the number of unread stories</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it didn’t make Robert feel guilty or sad. Because in 11th-century Europe, being a very good father was not assessed in terms of quantity of contact. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the light of our improved understanding of the needs of the child, our vision of the decent parent has become much more demanding: a good parent devotes a lot of time and thought to their child, they are present at crucial moments. To be a good parent has become much more emotionally demanding than ever before. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our best &#8211; and very time consuming &#8211; ideas about how to raise a child have arrived on the scene at a very awkward moment. Because we’ve also discovered some crucial things about productivity and efficiency. Competitive, open markets have been astonishingly productive but they leave us challenged around time. Our best ideas about how to run an economy and our best ideas about how to raise families are completely at odds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Against work-life balance </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finding a comfortable, harmonious balance between the demands of work and the needs of children is a very tantalising thought. It <em>sounds</em> like obviously such a good idea. And we can always find a few people in the world who seem to achieve it with ease &#8211; just as there are people who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>are good at high-wire cycling.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">There are also people who achieve work-life balance</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should understand that attempting to have &#8211; at the same time &#8211; a good home life and a good work life is an inescapably very difficult thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s possible to pull it off: it does very rarely happen. But it’s very unlikely that you will be one of these people. We end up getting frustrated and angry with ourselves (and our partners) for failing to attain this very elusive condition. One might &#8211; with similar levels of justice &#8211; berate oneself for not combining a job in the accounts department of a supermarket chain with giving piano recitals at Grosser Musikvereinssaal in Vienna; or complaining that one’s partner is always failing to win vast sums in the Spanish lottery. It’s very unhelpful to imagine that we can have it all. Because even what are actually very worthy efforts look puny and disappointing by comparison. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The consoling thing is that the failure isn’t personal. It isn’t one’s own incompetence or lack of drive that sets work and home life at odds. We just happen to be living at a point in history where two big, opposed themes are very powerful. We have demanding ideas about the needs of families and relationships and we have demanding ideas about work, efficiency, profit and competition. Both are founded in crucial insights. It’s not our fault that they are opposed. But it does mean that we deserve a high dose of sympathy for the very tricky situation we happen to find ourselves in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For untold generations work was simply a matter of maintaining the status quo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/june.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7720" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/june.jpg?resize=635%2C624" alt="june" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Très riches heures (June)</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those who laboured in the fields might have had marginally better or worse years. But no matter how diligently they raked or with how much skill they wielded the scythe, they could never essentially change their lot. That was decided by birth &#8211; and could not usually be changed by their own efforts, however great. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7721" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the whole of the 19th century, the greatest place of hope in the world was New York, because it held open a fundamental idea &#8211; which overturned the static condition of the farm workers: irrespective of where you had started you could &#8211; through work and a good character &#8211; attain a full measure of success and prosperity there. Unlike almost anywhere else in the world, where your prospects were largely determined by the chances of birth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In particular, it was capitalism which seemed to be the bringer of opportunity. Everyone was familiar with its less alluring sides: unemployment, huge factories. But what capitalism promoted was the idea of personal progress through a job. Competition and free markets would give opportunity to hard work and talent. You could rise. And prices would fall &#8211; competition for sales would lead to higher standards of living and lower costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flights.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7722" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flights.jpg?resize=440%2C299" alt="flights" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">The beautiful idea of capitalism … Careers and happiness open to all</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now everywhere is New York. In a couple of respects, capitalism has delivered on this promise. The prices of many goods have fallen. The kinds of lives we can lead, in material terms, has been transformed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Across the UK in 1930, the average family spent 55% of its income on food. In fact, around 5% of all income went just on that. Today, for a typical British family, around 10% of the weekly budget goes on food. And only about 0.5% of a family’s income goes on bread. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there are other ways in which the capitalist dream has not turned out as expected. It doesn’t deliver the level of satisfaction and contentment that was anticipated around work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Five factors of modern work experience undermine the promise of capitalism. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The necessary failure of ambition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalism distributes ambitions very broadly and in a way very generously &#8211; but also very cruelly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whartonnow-fal03-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7723" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whartonnow-fal03-1.jpg?resize=468%2C285" alt="whartonnow-fal03-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Graduates of the of Wharton School 2004 Executive MBA</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By many measures, the graduates of a decade or so ago have almost all done very well. They earn well above the national average income. They hold responsible positions. They fly business class. But these external measures are not ones which have most psychological force. We measure ourselves against those we feel are in our peer group and in the light of our highest hopes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By these standards, capitalism has a stern message to send to the graduates of the world’s leading business schools. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To have any chance of getting to the very top, you have to be absolutely determined to get there. You have to invest you time, your efforts, your soul in getting there. You have to really want it. But, that won’t be enough. Most of you will fail in this ambition. And you will be haunted by that failure. You will look at the photo and envy the few who made it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It is a statistical law. The number of CEO positions is very limited. The number of graduates for elite business schools is quite large. Many people are competing very eagerly for the small number of prize jobs. Most must fail. They fail by a very high standard. But, since it is the standard set by their own ambition, it is the one they use to measure themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6835109847_9573610cce_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7724" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6835109847_9573610cce_z.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="6835109847_9573610cce_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s constant envy. There are a couple of people who make it through the regular cullings at McKinsey; there’s someone who is linked to one of the great startups and has made a significant fortune; there’s the person who’s had a great run as a staffer at the White House. In comparison your own career feels lacklustre. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At social gatherings you wince at the sight of the words on your own business card: Associate Vice-President: a title designed to sound big to outsiders. But insiders &#8211; like all your friends &#8211; know it means your career has stalled. You worry that your partner doesn’t fully respect you. When you got together, a few years ago, you both used to talk a lot about the future. Now it’s as if your partner is avoiding the topic of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The dreams invested in you &#8211; by your family, your earlier self &#8211; haven’t come true. You feel ashamed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to laugh at people without much money who hope to win the lottery. The desire to win makes sense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- obviously. It’s just that the statistics are grim. They’re shooting at a tiny, very distant target. Failure is almost inevitable. But there’s an executive class version of this. And yet ambition &#8211; the hope of doing well in work &#8211; isn’t an optional add on. It’s actually central to how capitalism works: companies require all this competition for the top places; it needs a lot of people to aim much higher than they can achieve. For a few to succeed and be effective, many must try and fail. Collective efficiency is won at the price of many frustrated lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We have to abandon many version of who we could be</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1845 &#8211; when modern capitalism was moving into a higher gear, its most famous critic put a finger on one of its drawbacks, and dreamed of an ideal solution: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.&#8221; [</span>Marx,<em> German Ideology</em>, 1845]</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marx was tapping into a widespread longing. Each person has so much potential. The key exemplar &#8211; in Marx’s own lifetime &#8211; of the full human life was Goethe: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stieler_Goethe.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7725" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stieler_Goethe.jpg?resize=635%2C472" alt="Stieler_Goethe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was an individual who seemed to have fully explored the range of his ambition and longing &#8211; who had been married and had a family, but who also had a wildly adventurous romantic and sexual life; who had travelled and made a wonderful home; who had been a poet and thinker, but also a diplomat government minister, and political advisor, who had made discoveries in science. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe is the grown-up, high-cultural version of a widespread instinct. Before they have much understanding of the reality of work, a child will typically lay out a long list of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>‘what I’d like to be when I grow up’: an astronaut, inventor, bus driver, champion trampoliner, model, doctor, explorer… Every one of these jobs has spoken to some part of the child’s identity. But the kind of life Goethe led (and that a child might want) has become ever more unusual. The ideal rounded, Renaissance individual has come ever more into conflict with the ideology of modern work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our hopes of a full life establish a standard by which we are almost certain to fail. It’s a harsh truth: we are all likely to die with significant, lovely parts of ourselves unexplored. Some of the best parts of our potential will remain undeveloped. Our best plans and projects will largely go unrealised. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalism requires specialisation and devotion. So in order to survive and get on in a competitive, market-oriented economy, we‘re going to have to be very selective about the things we focus on, and we&#8217;re going to have to give huge quantities of time (huge parts of our lives) to these things. As a society, we benefit if someone has put 25,000 hours into dental hygiene or 36,000 hours into data entry systems &#8211; but the personal cost is the loss of all the other things we might have done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>or been. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can dream of so much more than we will ever be able to live out. Every day we will be reminded of what has had to be sacrificed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: It is impossible to be calm</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For much of western history, it would have been unthinkable to have had a major industry concerned with calming people down. Early nights, nothing going on, simple routines repeated day after day were not needed as special solutions to anxiety because they were, for so many people, the normal condition of everyday life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/131_MIS-scottish-croft-full.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7726" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/131_MIS-scottish-croft-full.jpg?resize=635%2C301" alt="131_MIS-scottish-croft-full" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Where everyone (almost) lived until the day before yesterday, historically speaking. Reducing stimulation was not necessary.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s only when &#8211; as now &#8211; that anxiety and agitation are omnipresent in our lives that we built up a big collective interest in the search for tranquility. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This search started to take off at much the same time as the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, when towns were growing rapidly and factories springing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Increasingly, people started to delight in the idea that far away, in some new and unspoilt portion of the world, they could find true ease and relaxation. They could get away from the mounting pressure of home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 18th-century artist William Hodges was especially taken by the calming aspects of the island of Tahiti (first visited by westerners only in 1768). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hodges_waterfall-tahiti.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7727" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hodges_waterfall-tahiti.jpg?resize=635%2C396" alt="Hodges_waterfall-tahiti" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such images speak to our longing for calm and ease &#8211; for a simple natural, unanxious life. You too could have this life &#8211; they say &#8211; but you’d have to go to Tahiti, which will take five months and you’ll probably be attacked by pirates on the way; and it may not be quite as Hodges portrays it when you get there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Today a huge industry exists to get us to these places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bora-bora-pearl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7728" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bora-bora-pearl.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="bora-bora-pearl" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A large part of the modern meaning of luxury is that you will be able to calm down; you will be less pressured; you will be able to switch off and get away from it all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an attitude to travel entirely at odds with that which prevailed in earlier ages, when the purpose of travel was to seek stimulation, adventure. It never quite works. The luxury cabanas of the Maldives are the recipients of extraordinary amounts of frustration and angst.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not our fault that we are agitated. Calm and tranquility depend on the thought that one has enough for tomorrow, that the challenges of the next period are ones we already know how to meet: we feel calm because we feel secure. But the conditions of modern life make such a feeling of calm very elusive. So even if we do get the prosperity and advancement that capitalism promised, we still end up anxious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: The permanent existential crisis of business </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work intersects with a basic feature of the human condition: we make the wrong choices. The natural ideal of a choice &#8211; of course &#8211; is that you are fully informed about the significance of the various options. You can then select the one that best fits your needs. But the reality isn’t usually like this, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Existentialist philosophers &#8211; most notably Jean Paul Sartre &#8211; were keenly attentive to the fact that usually, when we chose, we don’t know anything like enough about the various options.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7729" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi.jpg?resize=400%2C561" alt="6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sartre: We’re forced to choose, even though we don’t actually know what’s the right thing to do</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We lack the relevant information and experience. And yet we have to make decisions that will have huge implications for our own lives &#8211; and the lives of others. Should we expand into the South Korean market? Is this the time for a large scale rebranding exercise? Do I resign if I don’t get this promotion? Should I take the job in New York &#8211; or take up the offer in Tangiers? If my partner’s career takes them to Germany, do I follow, or do we break up over this? If there are children, do I take on more work (to pay for things) or less work (to spend more time around them)? Should you try to get into the property market now, or wait for a correction? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life demands choices constantly, and we will by definition screw a great many up so that by the time you’ve reached 35, you will have made 150 big decisions, and 15 might be very, very wrong and you will be paying for this for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Put someone long enough on earth and they will, through no particular evil quality, tie themselves up in extraordinary knots. They will be assailed by regrets. They will be eaten up every day by the thought that if only they had acted differently 10 years ago, things would be much better today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_1825-1905_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_1862.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7730" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_1825-1905_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_1862.jpg?resize=635%2C561" alt="William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_(1825-1905)_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_(1862)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Orestes pursued by ‘the Furies’ of remorse and regret: an extreme image of a normal experience</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> a </span>theme that Greek tragic writers were sympathetic to. They thought that the key to dealing with it was to acknowledge the inevitability of regret. They didn’t think that if only we were smart and honest and well-intentioned we could get through life with few regrets and without the pangs of remorse. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were particularly taken with the life story of Oedipus. On a journey, the talented and ambitious Oedipus was stopped by people he thought were robbers. He struck out at their leader and killed him. What no one knew at the time time was that the man he killed was actually his father. Of course, if this had been clear, everything would have been different. What the Greeks so liked about the story was the sense that it wasn’t the fault of Oedipus. But much later when he finds out what he’s done he is, of course, tormented by guilt and sorrow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a message we benefit from hearing quite often. Because what helps with regret is the knowledge that &#8211; in fact &#8211; every life is burdened by regret in some shape or form. The ‘regret-free life’ exists only in French cabaret songs.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: We’re wrongly designed for modern work&#8230;</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolution is one of the biggest modern ideas. It looks into the past and explains how we got here and why we are as we are. The main person who discovered how evolution works -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Charles Darwin -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>was deeply unpopular with large swathes of the population<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>in 19th-century England. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7623" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg?resize=450%2C583" alt="5.Darwin as monkey.jpg- acr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin was mocked because he caused deep offence</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By saying that ‘we’re descended from Apes’, Darwin’s reminding us that we carry with us a lot of baggage. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>evolved (in the distant past) because certain characteristics<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>worked well in environments very different from the ones we live in today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolution (via gene mutation and reproduction) works to a very, very slow clock; big changes take hundreds of generations, so it lags weirdly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>when there are rapid changes to the human context. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve evolved to have a strong liking for sweet things (which worked really well when the sweetest things around was a papaya or a banana &#8211; because IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, a craving for sweet things is a good guide to what will help you flourish.

<h5 class="p1">We&#8217;ve evolved to be suited to this kind of life. Evolution means we’re going to be saddled with some very inconvenient but maddeningly deep-rooted tendencies</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, we’ve evolved so that at times of conflict we get aggressive. It’s brilliant if what you are afraid of is a bear-size hyena or a saber-toothed cat. But if what you are afraid of is psychologically complex:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>getting trapped on a project with a colleague who doesn’t understand you or worries about being taken for granted, then ideally you want to approach this anxiety with as much cool reason and patience as possible; evolution, however, is still dealing with the terrors of the savanna and so pumps up our panic levels to the maximum. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve evolved to have relatively short attentions spans and to be very easily distracted by brightly-coloured moving things. Which worked beautifully when we needed to be on the look out for snakes in the long grass &#8211; and which goes some way to explaining why Times Square is one of the biggest tourist attractions on the planet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7734" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg?resize=636%2C424" alt="800px-New_york_times_square-terabass" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this jumpy, highly visual kind of mind is ill-adapted to much of the work we need to do day-to-day at work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Work-005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7735" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Work-005.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Work" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lag in genetic evolution means that our brains are brilliantly adapted to the situation we used to be in; but are tragicomically mismatched to our modern environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolution tells us why we struggle to fit the huge demands of work into our lives. We are trying to get ourselves to do something that’s very hard for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It changes the scale of our troubles. Although so often it seems incredibly personal that one fails to combine work harmoniously with family life or with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>exercise or with maintaining old friendships, the charge should not really be laid primarily against oneself. The fault lies with something much larger than our own individual failings (real though those are). It lies with where we are in history, with the nature of the economy and in the slow pace of evolution.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Understanding how to serve customers well is a major factor in the success of corporations: and service has a big role outside work too. It’s one of the many ways in which there’s an overlap between getting better in business and getting better at life in general. Service means helping others to thrive. It’s a goal that’s been around longer than humanity.</p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Macaca_fuscata_grooming_Iwatayama_20090201.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7428" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Macaca_fuscata_grooming_Iwatayama_20090201.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="640px-Macaca_fuscata,_grooming,_Iwatayama,_20090201" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A service culture exists amongst Japanese Snow Monkeys</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re all keen on being served well. But getting good at serving is tricky. It’s a problem that deserves a great deal of sympathy. We’re one of the first generations in history to be grappling with the delivery of effective service on a mass scale. There are so many ways service can go wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The fear that it’s humiliating to serve</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For centuries, the idea of service was focused on one particular kind of job: being a servant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/040-downton-abbey-theredlist.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7429" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/040-downton-abbey-theredlist.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="040-downton-abbey-theredlist" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It didn’t necessarily seem like a terrible option at the time. There was little social mobility; if your parents were servants you were probably going to end up doing the same thing. Carrying a tray or polishing shoes might not seem at all bad compared to hewing coal or digging the fields. But there must have been untold millions of moments of petty humiliation, many of them around unpleasant bosses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then across the Western World this kind of employment largely disappeared, under the combined impacts of WWI and WWII. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3165261-10997_0x420.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7431" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3165261-10997_0x420.jpg?resize=635%2C467" alt="3165261-10997_0x420" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Mary Quant, 1965</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And by the 1960s &#8211; in the New York of <em>Mad Men</em> or the London of Mary Quant -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>being a servant came to sound like a dreary, slightly shameful kind of work. Service wasn’t sexy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre, who had been offered the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1964 and had very publicly rejected it, were getting a wider hearing. In his</span><em> Being and Nothingness </em>(1943), we find a strangely annoying waiter as the focus of Sartre’s account of what he felt was wrong with society in general: to serve is to be inauthentic, to fail to be who you really are.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/url.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7432" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/url.jpg?resize=440%2C352" alt="url" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Let us consider this waiter in the cafe. His movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid. He comes toward the patrons with a step a little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly; his voice, his eyes express an interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer.’ (<em>Being and Nothingness</em>, Part I Chapter 2 &#8211; &#8216;Bad Faith&#8217;) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all these reasons, the image of the grovelling, defeated &#8211; and resentful &#8211; servant (or waiter) infected the whole idea of service. The successful person is served, the less successful does the serving. This attitude lingers. The background belief that serving is humiliating leads to problems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The low esteem in which service can be held leads some ambitious people to steer clear of obvious ‘service’ roles. It’s easy to under-rate the potential economic contribution of good service to the company. So it gets under-rewarded, which maintains the circle of low-esteem. Companies think they care about service; they certainly don’t want to offer bad service. But because we don’t have a clear image of what great service really means, we don’t see the potential that’s being missed. We don’t realise how much mediocre service is costing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10651314316_036de46c9d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7434" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/10651314316_036de46c9d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="10651314316_036de46c9d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this can lead to veiled aggressive behaviour on the part of the one serving, for example, when the air steward brusquely tells you to put your seat upright (though it must actually have been a previous passenger who left it very slightly reclined because you didn’t touch it). In his or her head, the steward might think:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I have to serve you, but don’t think I like you; I’m only doing it for the money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I had any other option, I wouldn’t be doing this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve got to smile &#8211; but inside I’m seething… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve got to pretend you’re right (but I think you’re an idiot).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer picks up on the attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We’re incredibly sensitive to the difference between a real smile (which we love) and a fake one (which puts us one edge, make us suspicious). The negative attitude around the status of serving seems natural to us. But actually it’s a product of culture. That is: it depends on the images and associations that happen to be familiar to us. Which means it would be relatively straightforward to do a crucial thing: to get a more accurate understanding of the dignity of service and then to increase its prestige. It just means regularly reminding ourselves of some very positive ideas about service. To get this started, we can look back to some high points in the history of service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Jesus was keen on service</em>:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity tapped into the big idea that service is noble, and not humiliating at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/El_Lavatorio_Tintoretto.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7435" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/El_Lavatorio_Tintoretto.jpg?resize=635%2C247" alt="El_Lavatorio_(Tintoretto)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle of the 16th century, the Italian artist Tintoretto painted several pictures of a scene from the life of Jesus. Just before they sit down to have the last supper, Jesus gets on his hands and knees and acts as the servant of his disciples, carefully washing and wiping their dusty feet. The point of the story was to say: here’s why this man was so great. He wanted to help people, he saw service as one of the greatest things we can do. And Tintoretto adds to the message by painting a very grand picture of this act of service. In effect, the artist is saying: let me show you this magnificent scene, this heroic act. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The greatest Roman Emperor, Trajan, saw himself as a servant </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trajan (53-117 AD) ushered in the </span>golden age of the Roman Empire, when good government was combined with prosperity and security. His descendants were great leaders who revered his example, culminating in the rule of his great-great nephew, Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the characteristic stories about Trajan told how when he was riding to review his troops, he was accosted in the street by a desperate mother whose son had been killed, seeking his help. Trajan was incredibly busy, she was no one very important. The Emperor took the opportunity to put one of his core convictions into practice. He stopped, got off his horse and addressed her case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan_oil_on_canvas_1858.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7436" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan_oil_on_canvas_1858.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="Delacroix_-_The_Justice_of_Trajan,_oil_on_canvas,_1858" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wanted to demonstrate to his followers that helping her wasn’t beneath his dignity: it’s what his position was really all about: the point of all the power and authority is to bring justice to the people: to serve them well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The painter Eugène Delacroix was obsessed by this moment. He’s summoning up all the grandeur of the emperor &#8211; the banners, the trumpets, the rearing war horse &#8211; and focusing not on conquering the enemy or setting out on a great voyage of exploration but on a routine and deeply honourable act of good service. He’s using art to show what we usually can’t see: the true value of quiet acts of kindness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Luther and the serving maid</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1520, Martin Luther (1483-1546) published the second of his three major treatises, <em>On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church</em>. It was an extension of his re-reading of Christianity and embodied his nascent Protestant ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7441" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration.jpg?resize=635%2C488" alt="Martin_Luther_by_Cranach-restoration" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the work, Luther radically claimed that one can serve God in a variety of ways, not just by entering the Priesthood: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;Hence I advise no man, yea, I dissuade every man from entering into the priesthood or any religious order, unless he be so fortified with knowledge as to understand that, however sacred and lofty may be the works of priests or of the religious orders, they differ not at all in the sight of God from the works of a husbandman labouring in his field, or of a woman attending to her household affairs, but that in His eyes all things are measured by faith alone . . . Nay, it very often happens that the common work of a servant or a handmaiden is more acceptable to God than all the fastings and works of a monk or a priest, when they are done without faith.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luther’s big idea was that Christians could serve God by carrying out essential work, such as looking after the family, labouring and farming. Famously, Luther writes that ‘God is milking the cows through the vocation of the milkmaid.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This meant that every legitimate piece of work was a ‘calling’ from God; a ‘vocation’. God has endowed each and every one of us with talents that can be used to help one another out. These talents manifest themselves in work: a skilled baker can literally give ‘us our daily bread’, soldiers can ‘deliver us from evil’ and nurses and doctors can heal the sick. In total, then, God looks after humanity through workers. Everyone undertaking these essential tasks is wearing what Luther calls the ‘mask of God’, since God is behind each task. Luther says God wants us to serve one another through work as a means of serving him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/at-the-linen-closet-16631.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7442" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/at-the-linen-closet-16631.jpg?resize=635%2C589" alt="at-the-linen-closet-1663(1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luther was making a huge point. To do a small service whole-heartedly and well is actually to do a great thing &#8211; though its greatness is spiritual rather than material and so is easily missed. It’s not at all necessary to share Luther’s religious convictions to be impressed by his line of thought. There’s a big psychological benefit to doing a simple task cheerfully and neatly &#8211; even if it’s only loading the dishwasher so every item is in the right place or tidying the linen cupboard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Napoleon, the night before the Battle of Austerlitz </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The night before his greatest victory &#8211; the Battle of Austerlitz &#8211; Napoleon went round the tents of his troops, making sure they’d had their rations and that they were settling down quietly. It was a task that was hardly required by the supreme Commander. A minor adjutant would have been fine. But Napoleon was sending a message about the nobility of serving. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their different ways, these heroes of service are all counteracting the notion that service is what the weak do for the strong. Instead, they are seeing service as something that everyone should be involved in. It’s part of the well-lived life. It’s a noble thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7443" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Jacques-Louis_David_-_The_Emperor_Napoleon_in_His_Study_at_the_Tuileries_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An unexpected ally in this campaign is Andy Warhol. He entirely agreed that glamour is the key to raising the prestige of service: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;They should have a college course now for maids and call it something glamorous. People don&#8217;t want to work at something unless there&#8217;s a glamorous name tagged to it&#8230; Even very intelligent people could get a lot out of being maids because they&#8217;d see so many interesting people and be working in the most beautiful houses. I mean, everybody does something for everybody else, and if it weren&#8217;t for the stigma we give certain jobs, the exchange would always be equal. A mother is always doing things for her child, so what&#8217;s wrong with a person off the street doing something for you?&#8230;I&#8217;ve always thought that the President could do so much here to help change images. If the President would go into a public bathroom in the Capitol, and have the TV cameras film him cleaning the toilets and saying &#8216;why not?&#8230; The President has so much good publicity potential that hasn&#8217;t been exploited. He should just sit down one day and make a list of all the things that people are embarrassed to do that they shouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed to do, and then do them all on television.&#8217; (</span><em>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</em>)</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He thought that the airline industry could spearhead the revolution in the perception of service: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1970s.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7444" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1970s.jpg?resize=445%2C600" alt="1970s" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;Airline stewardesses have the best public image. Their work is actually what the waitresses at Bickford&#8217;s do, plus a few additional duties. I don&#8217;t want to put down the airline stewardesses. I just want to put up the Bickford ladies. The difference is that airline stewardessing is a new world job that never had to contend with any class stigmas left over from the old world peasant-aristocracy syndrome.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s amazing what glamour can do to raise the prestige of a service job. Prostitution is not, generally, a high-status job. But, in Japan, poets and artist worked to endow sexual services with glamour. They invented the idea of the geisha. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7445" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="1180px-Niigata_geisha_dancing2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What distinguishes the geisha is the range and quality of the service provided: it’s sexual, but also intellectual and aesthetic. Under this improved description, and supported by intelligent advocacy, a form of prostitution became widely admired &#8211; and deeply respectable. The Japanese understood the mechanism for making this transformation in status: beautiful art works and elegant poems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal future, the perception we have of service could be very different from what it is today. We can imagine a world in which being someone&#8217;s personal servant or the nanny to their children could be a deeply prestigious, highly coveted job. Instead of dreaming of working for Goldman Sachs, the most ambitious college graduates would be anxiously working out how to position themselves as a potential valet or family tutor. It wouldn’t be fake prestige: it would be founded on an accurate vision of the worth of the service provided. Bringing up children well is one of the central tasks of a life. The people who do it well (the best nannies, teachers and tutors) should be glamorous &#8211; and correspondingly well paid. The ideal personal helper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>is managing, correcting and refining their employer’s self-conception. They are making life more effective and meaningful. These are huge contributions and the rightful target of ambition. In the Utopia, service would have the high prestige it deserves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The belief that the customer is awful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sadly, it&#8217;s not always hard to come to this conclusion. They often seem to be asking you to hate them. The irritation of the server with the served is entirely understandable. But, it is also potentially disastrous &#8211; obviously. The server’s mask slips, a little of their contempt comes through. The manager is dragged in. The customer, whose self-regard has been injured &#8211; talks viciously about the company to all their friends. Next time you look there’s a 27-reasons-I-hate-your-business page on Facebook swelling its numbers.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">© Flickr/Alexander Rabb</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To address this, it’s necessary to engage with one of the biggest (and most productive) questions we can ask: <em>why do other people behave in ways that aren’t very nice? </em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three big answers: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Firstly: In the past, the other person suffered in ways that have left scars. What you see as annoying patterns of behaviour originated long ago as strategies for coping with very frightening situations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If they are snobbish or pompous &#8211; it’s probably because at a formative point they faced grim humiliations. They had to emphasise and grasp after status wherever they could because they felt its lack so desperately. The outer circumstances may have moved on for this individual, but their psychological habits are still desperately fighting the old battles. At the back of their minds they are still warding off a terrible humiliation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If they get furious over a trivial thing, it’s probably because in the past they really were exposed to a lot of aggression. They coped by bearing their teeth and shouting and making themselves look dangerous &#8211; aggression is a very natural defence mechanism. Because the instincts are such slow learners, they end up shouting at you, though the person they are really trying to scare may have passed away five years ago, or be living these days in a small farmhouse in the Massif Central.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer is scared, not mean or bad &#8211; though, unfortunately, at first sight, they look mean and bad and not at all scared. If they revealed their distress more obviously &#8211; if they wept or looked terrified &#8211; we’d behave gently. Yet it really is the same distress, only presented in a misleading and deeply unfortunate disguise. And they are in need of the same gentleness and forbearance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secondly: There’s a big problem on their mind. They haven’t told you about it, of course. But there was a very difficult meeting at work earlier in the day. Or they are going through a brutal divorce. Or their dog had to be put down yesterday &#8211; their beloved companion for 14 memorable years. Or the Moroccan economy &#8211; where they have major holdings &#8211; is in crisis. They are distressed about something you can’t be aware of. And it leads them to behave in unpleasant ways. It feels as if it is about you, but it isn’t. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key moves in psychoanalysis is to look at the trouble children have understanding how a difficult mood of a parent isn&#8217;t about them. The powerful, natural tendency for the child is to suppose otherwise, to think that, if dad is upset, it’s my fault, when the real cause is he’s trying to shed some weight and not having a second helping of lasagna drives him nuts; or he’s been playing badly at tennis for the last two weeks and it’s getting him down: he feels he’s past it; or he’s having an affair and feels terribly guilty. It’s incredibly hard for the child to understand things when the mood isn’t about them and yet it is happening around them. They have so few explanatory resources to bring to the situations &#8211; how could they possibly know what drives the adult psyche? As we grow older, we get marginally better at realising that what’s going on for other people often isn&#8217;t about us, even when we’re the nearest object in the environment. But the idea remains fragile in our minds.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Regular reminders of the concept that there are off-stage causes to others’ moods is a huge help in navigating our way through life. Learning not to take it personally isn’t a last counsel of despair. It’s usually a deeply accurate assessment of what is really going one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thirdly: The other person is actually quite nice… in parts of their life you don’t get to see. The customer isn’t revealing the whole of their life. It’s natural &#8211; but mistaken &#8211; for us to assume that a person is entirely as we happen to see them being. The muddled shopper must be, we suppose, befuddled about everything all the time. It’s hard for us to believe that the woman who absolutely can’t decide whether she wants steak tartare or lobster &#8211; is assured and decisive when it comes to drafting reports on the opportunities and risks for pharmaceutical companies in the Mexican market. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider this picture by the 19th-century French artist Ingres. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7450" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817.jpg?resize=635%2C506" alt="henry-iv-recieving-the-ambassador-of-spain-1817" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a history picture of the French King Henry the Fourth &#8211; who reigned a couple of centuries earlier. Here, Henry’s giving a horse ride to his children and having the time of his life cavorting on the carpet. But this wasn’t at all how he usually came across. His people generally saw him as severe and a bit brutish. He ruled, people said, ‘with a sword in his hand and his arse on the saddle of a warhorse’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of people have Henry IV-like unexpected sides to their character, which tell you a lot about who they really are. The fussy customer works two nights a week for the Samaritans listening to people’s most terrible moments of distress. The guy with the ridiculously loud laugh and the crushingly boring stories runs the best shoe repair shop in Exeter: unrivalled in that city for quality, speed and fair prices. The fickle woman with the posh voice is deeply loyal to her transexual brother and was his main support all through his transition. If you knew these sides it would change your view of who they are. But we just don’t get to see them in service situations. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good service draws on sympathy. Instead of getting offended by the annoying behaviour of those we serve, we’d be more patient and forgiving. Not because we’re soft-hearted or can’t stand up for ourselves. But because we’d have a clearer idea of what is really going on: I’m not encountering a dreadful person. Just an ordinary person labouring under a fear, a current problem or who isn’t quite at their best round here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal service company, therefore, wouldn’t be preaching to its employees to smile a lot and rehearse saying ‘of course, madam’ in the bathroom mirror. It would be more focused on presenting its workers with helpful theories of human nature. It would improve service &#8211; in tricky situations &#8211; and manage staff morale by continually reminding its workforce of some powerful truths about how decent people can come across badly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: The failure to recognise customer anxiety</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong when it fails to understand that interacting with a given business is likely to have generated a cluster of anxious feelings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16824280347_9d9b71a419_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7454" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16824280347_9d9b71a419_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16824280347_9d9b71a419_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a little remarked-upon fact, but every service situation is associated with a degree of anxiety in the customer: the task of a good business is to understand the dynamics of anxiety on top of which it will inevitably sit &#8211; and then to take steps to correct and attenuate these. We have an image of a customer utterly confident in their needs and in themselves, just keen to extract great service and move on. But the portrait needs to be redrawn. We come at service situations with a range of worries. Providing good service means asking yourself an unusual question: ‘What are the anxieties that cluster around my area of service &#8211; and how can I best deal with them…?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might name a new way of serving:<strong> Anxiety-focused service</strong>. It has two components. The first is the sympathetic, imaginative exploration of the worries that customers might have. Not by asking them &#8211; because they won’t, or often can’t, tell you what’s really bugging them. Either it’s something they find embarrassing to talk about or it’s very hard to pinpoint. Instead, imagine you are a novelist and you’ve got a very nice character who happens to be anxious around this area of service. What would be going on for them? (In an ideal world, this form of imaginative exercise would be a main source of employment for novelists &#8211; which would in turn deeply help business and the bank balances of authors). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second is working out how to zap the problem. How can you meet the anxiety and offer reassurance or help? Each industry will have different anxieties to contend with, you need to know your industry-specific anxiety and put in place measures to deal with them. To get this field of business started, we offer some case studies: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">I: A customer walks into a jewellery store selling engagement rings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How is he anxious? He knows nothing about carats, he is scared of being thought cheap but also of spending too much. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zapping the fear: One might have a jewellery store that advertises saying: &#8216;a ring is nice, but kindness is nicer. We’ll make sure you don’t blow your savings on a symbol.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And: &#8216;it would be weird if you knew a lot about diamonds; you’ve had everything else to think about.&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the words<em> us too</em> printed on the reverse. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the morning, alongside a copy of the <em>Frankfurter Allgemeine</em> or <em>The Australian</em>, they slip a little note into the bag hanging from your door handle, containing a quote from Goethe: ‘No one ever understood me; I never really understood other people; no one understands anyone else’. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be daunting &#8211; especially for men &#8211; to walk into a clothes shop with the idea of purchasing a pair of trousers. In a minute you’ll be telling a stranger about whether a piece of cloth is too tight in the groin area; you’ll be in your underpants shielded only by a thin beige curtain that won’t close properly; they might start measuring your inside leg. Some people don’t mind. But many do. They’ll spend years with a slightly wrong pair of trousers because (though they’re courageous in other areas) they couldn’t face properly talking to the salesperson about the fit.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal of good service has unfortunately been connected with the notion of being gregarious. We have a picture of the ideal person in service: chatty, cheerful and perhaps a little loud. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should recognise that this manner is only found attractive and enticing by a share of the population. For many, an excessively chatty, upbeat manner is alarming rather than reassuring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service works with a mental picture (which won’t usually be very explicit) of what the customer is like: what kind of person are they? What will make them feel comfortable or ill at ease?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9317467406_ff115a213e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7464" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9317467406_ff115a213e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="9317467406_ff115a213e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The term ‘introversion’ is a relatively recent &#8211; and very helpful &#8211; invention. It became mainstream through its use in the Myers-Briggs personality Type Indicator, which was introduced in the 1940s and later widely adopted in business. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sums up and labels a very common characteristic: being preoccupied with one’s own thoughts and feelings, the desire to be given a lot of personal space, a tendency to feel overwhelmed by the attentions of other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it does something else: the term &#8211; and the tests &#8211; reveal that this is a very normal characteristic. About 50% of customers will be like this &#8211; at least to some extent. And about 25% will be markedly like this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Introversion’ isn’t the name of a problem. It’s a name of a normal way of being. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a challenge because people who work in front-line service situations are not likely to be particularly introverted themselves. (This is a consequence of our natural &#8211; but misguided &#8211; assumption that to be good at service and selling you should ideally be very outgoing.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s opportunity for a lot more introvert-sensitive service. It’s possible to expand into this underdeveloped market &#8211; a market defined not by geography or income, but by psychology. And it’s not exploitation, because often the shy or introverted person would actually very much like to buy certain products, but they are hampered from doing so because of the prevalent technique of gregarious service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Training in introvert-sensitive service would be inspired by the work of the English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/winnicott-from-bellespics-eu1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7526" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/winnicott-from-bellespics-eu1.jpg?resize=275%2C275" alt="winnicott-from-bellespics-eu" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Winnicott’s tips on service, part I </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He talks very strictly against parents who always want to ‘jolly’ a baby along, rather than let it have its own moods. It’s a bit disconcerting at first &#8211; what could be wrong with keeping a child jolly? His point is that it’s the implied idea that it’s terrible to be a bit low, or upset, or quiet, or absorbed &#8211; in any way not overtly cheery &#8211; that does the damage. These low-key states aren’t a problem. It’s OK to feel sad because some things, like a broken toy, the death of a goldfish or being lonely on Sunday afternoon, are a bit sad. So, it&#8217;s fine for a customer to be pensive, solemn or quiet. They don’t need their mood lifted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Winnicott&#8217;s tips on service, part II</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott was sensitive to the (unintended) ways hyped-up expectations can get us down. Because we’re uncomfortably aware that we won’t live up to them. Winnicott specialised in problems in families and in his work he encountered many patients who were deeply disappointed with themselves for ‘not being a good mother’ or feeling ‘I’m nothing like the great dad I’m supposed to be’. But he could see that &#8211; imperfect as they certainly were, they were pretty good parents. They meant well, they tried, they made mistakes but they did their best in the circumstances, and he came to the conclusion that this was &#8211; really &#8211; what children needed to encounter. What one really needs, growing up, is not an ideally flawless parent, but a model of how to be a decent, OK, but inevitably flawed individual. What the child needs, Winnicott said, is a ‘good enough’ parent.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of referring to an ideal, one should help people feel OK about the ‘good enough.’ It’s a move that can be applied widely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Rather than tout a product as ‘a great deal,&#8217; they could call it ‘a not too bad offer’; the suit you try on might be praised as ‘pretty much OK.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– From: &#8216;there&#8217;s a fantastic range of socks&#8217; to ‘we’ve got some moderately decent socks over here.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– From: ‘you’ll love this’ to ‘this might just be acceptable.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Instead of saying ‘have a great day’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- to someone who will (probably) have a disappointing meeting a work, a frustrating commute, a tense disagreement with their partner and have to pay their road-tax bill &#8211; one could more usefully wish them a ‘good enough’ day -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a day that will be far from great in all respects. To the more thoughtful person (more introverted, more shy) it will sound genuinely friendly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Over-commitment to ‘the rules’ </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the more dramatic failures of service occurs when an employee sticks strictly to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>‘the rules’, apparently on behalf of the business, but in a way that is maddening to the customer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a car-hire desk, the specific car that’s been booked in the system has turned up late and is still being cleaned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But a similar car is free. Yet the employee will tell the customer (desperate to get on their way to a meeting in Slough) that they have to wait forty minutes for the cleaning and checking of the vehicle. All the while, the customer can see the other vehicle sitting there out the window. ‘The rule is, if the car is back, the customer gets the assigned car; it is still on the M4. I could give you the other one.’ The person at the desk knows there’s nothing the customer can do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5546326877_816c553ee8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7469" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5546326877_816c553ee8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="5546326877_816c553ee8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A passenger with a business class ticket doesn’t have a special express lane card for security screening. (They started their journey, and had all their boarding passes issued at a provincial airport where they don’t have such things.) The attendant has seen a million BA business passengers, but &#8211; since there is no voucher &#8211; sternly points in the direction of a huge queue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A mother decides to pay her lackadaisical son’s electricity bill on a small student apartment before the supply is cut off (while the boy is hiking across the Andes and out of satellite range for two weeks). She finds the call centre employee demanding the account password, which &#8211; of course &#8211; she doesn&#8217;t have, because ‘information about the account is private’ &#8211; although the malicious paying of other people’s electricity bills is not a recognised crime category. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The customer’s situation is clear. The employee knows they should be given the car that’s free now, let into the express lane or be allowed to pay the bill. But the employees are technically in the right. And they are safe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- the customer can’t do anything about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, this kind of behaviour is a problem for the company. Offending customers isn’t part of the corporate strategy. But in order to address it effectively it’s useful to start in an unexpected &#8211; but always important &#8211; way: with sympathy. We should admit that if you are feeling a bit pissed off with the world, it’s very tempting to cause others a bit of pain and hide behind the rules &#8211; especially if the people you are hurting seem to have a nicer life than you. It’s not nice, but it’s not strange. If we’re honest, we can probably all admit to moments when we’re hurting and we feel: why the hell should I help you?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might happen in a domestic setting. Your partner agreed to go out to see a film on Thursday night. But they had a tough day at work, and they’re not in the mood and at the last minute they say they’d rather stay in. You’re annoyed and you milk the situation: ‘you promised &#8211; so are you saying now that when you promise something, it doesn’t mean anything? You could have said ‘maybe’ you’d go out; but no, you said you definitely would &#8211; and now you’re going right back on your word.’ You’re technically in the right. Usually, if we’re being mean, we’re clearly in the wrong. It can be hard to resist the slightly sinister (but not uncommon) satisfaction of being simultaneously right and mean. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So too with the employee: the customer is squirming, &#8216;well &#8211; fuck them, I’m technically in the right.&#8217; We need to acknowledge that the position of ‘serving’ can be very problematic for some of us. We use the small power we have to cause inconvenience for people we feel resentment towards. We can afford to admit the desire to stop a superior, to get a little safe revenge for the the multiple disappointments of existence. The rule has given us the permission not to be very nice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One way the ideal company would address this service problem would be to be open about the temptation. Admitting the allure of this kind of situation doesn’t mean approving of it. In fact, acknowledging it is the key to keeping it in check. Being open about the desire sometimes to be mean to others, allows us to look at where the desire has come from. How does one arrive at this position? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes someone use ‘the rules’ in a mean way? We can go, sympathetically, behind the scenes of their life. The desire to hurt others is rooted in having been hurt too much oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16176068743_149f4c1c38_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7471" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16176068743_149f4c1c38_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16176068743_149f4c1c38_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Once, at a formative moment, they were humiliated and punished for doing something wrong. Then they saw someone else doing the same thing and ‘getting away with it’; it felt so unfair. Never again, if they could help it. If the rules are going to be imposed strictly on them they’re going to make sure the same applies to everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– They are trying to impose (in an admittedly ineffective way) order on a universe that feels chaotic. The news is filled with mayhem and greed, they can’t control their children, their partner, the erratic bus service… But here, at least, they can stick to a clear, precise arrangement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Too often they’ve been made to feel that a ‘superior’ person was looking down on them. These were very wounding experiences. They are on the look out for revenge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These aren’t very lovely things. But they call for sympathy &#8211; that is, the recognition that one has similar kinds of strands in one’s own experience. It’s understandable people end up being sticklers for the rules. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sympathetic understanding has a transformative effect. It doesn’t blame the individual for having had these experiences. But it reveals the way their current behaviour doesn&#8217;t really help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It was horrible to see someone getting away with something you were punished for. But it wasn’t the customer who got away with it (It was Jacqueline McFarlane of flat 5, 137 Acacia Avenue, West Solihull).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Sticking to the rules won’t actually compensate for the messy cupboard under the stairs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2785405723_824f3a4875_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7472" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2785405723_824f3a4875_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="2785405723_824f3a4875_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It wasn’t this customer who laughed at your shoes (it was a brattish guy who now has a young daughter with a speech impediment).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you admit you’re taking out your own troubles on another person, you can get more alive to the fact that this isn’t the person who hurt you. They’re just the nearest available target. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The company can also be up front about the danger. They can say: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve put in place a lot of rules and procedures which are designed to make things easier for everyone. The rules will give you some power over people at tricky moments in their lives. And we understand that sometimes you’ll feel tempted to abuse them in this way. But please don’t. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want you to be flexible. The most important thing is to help the customer. If that means leaving a box unticked or changing slightly the way something is done, that’s fine. The standard procedure isn’t set in stone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key thing the astute service provider is doing here is recognising how tempting it can be for an employee to offer bad service. To get great at providing service, the company needs to work with an accurate view of, and constructive sympathy for, the crooked timbers of human nature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: People haven’t served you enough</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not a cause of bad service that leaps to mind; but a standard reason service goes wrong is that the server hasn&#8217;t themselves had enough experience of being treated well. There hasn&#8217;t been enough good service coming in their direction.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An employee has been gradually getting more and more brittle around customers. In the canteen they get into the habit of mouthing off about the dreadful characters they have to deal with. Then they snap. A customer complains that the olives are green, not black; a guest harangues them because the bells are ringing for a wedding in a nearby church; someone gets annoyed because of the unusually high credit card surcharge (as if the sales assistant had themselves instituted this arrangement). The employee snaps. They shout. Or they rush off weeping. They calm down later, but they are dreadfully ashamed. They feel they’ve become a grumpy, short-fused person. They blame themselves for letting it get to them. They feel, frankly, a bit shitty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The employee who suddenly loses it is a problem for the business &#8211; and is a problem for the employee themselves. But addressing this issue means understanding it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should start by seeing that service requires us to step outside of the needs of our own ego for a while. We have to stop thinking about what we want, and think about what someone else wants. In short, service requires us to be generous. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the ability to be generous is not a fixed, stable feature of anyone’s character. When we’re generous, we’re drawing upon our generosity reservoir. Like any reservoir, if the supply doesn&#8217;t get topped up, it runs dry. When our generosity has been demanded more than it&#8217;s been topped up, we get crabby and upset. If pushed, we break. But we’re not bad people. We’re just people whose inner supply of generosity hasn’t been filled up quickly enough to cope with the demands that are being made on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2744567495_912dc8142a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7475" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2744567495_912dc8142a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="2744567495_912dc8142a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We suffer from depleted reservoirs of generosity &#8211; but, unfortunately, we don&#8217;t easily recognise that we do. Instead we blame ourselves. We feel it’s our fault for snapping when a more compassionate and helpful interpretation (such as might be offered by the ideal friend who, alas, isn&#8217;t always to hand) would be to say: of course you snapped &#8211; you’d been run dry. You’d been nice to tricky people all day &#8211; actually all week &#8211; and practically no one thanked you. You’d been asked for too much, when the world wasn&#8217;t supporting you enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What’s needed is a regular exercise of taking a generosity-reservoir audit. What’s the current ratio between you being nice to others and others being nice to you? If the balance is very much on demand over supply, you can be sure a problem is building. Recognising this isn&#8217;t a sign of weakness. It’s a sign of maturity. In exactly the same way that it&#8217;s grown up to admit that one is spending more than one is earning, or not getting enough sleep. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The generosity reservoir is topped up by a lot of things. Physical nurture helps. If you get a good night’s sleep, if you’ve had a healthy breakfast, if you’ve walked to work across a park (rather than battled into a crowded, delayed train). There can be a self-nurture in contemplating a tree or the sky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These good physical things build up our inner reserves and allow us to put our own inclinations to one side and be nice to others &#8211; for a while.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But just as much &#8211; or even more &#8211; the generosity reservoir is fed by psychological nurture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7476" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab.jpg?resize=635%2C438" alt="3cb793fb3b70ea3e955b6cb7ac64d8ab" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a child one might &#8211; ideally &#8211; have been held and comforted. Another person &#8211; infinitely bigger and stronger &#8211; was always saying how lovely and nice you were; your troubles could be soothed by a few kind words, a grazed knee gently cleaned and tended; your fears (of the dark, of the neighbour’s dog) would be dispelled by this person’s presence: you knew they would protect you and keep you safe. But now you are big and hairy, your mother isn’t around much and she doesn’t really understand your work anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through history, cultures have created substitute mothers to take up the task of psychic nurture &#8211; and renew our capacity to be generous to others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/botticelli_6_madonna_and_child_with_an_angel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7477" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/botticelli_6_madonna_and_child_with_an_angel.jpg?resize=635%2C553" alt="botticelli_6_madonna_and_child_with_an_angel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Catholic Church cast Mary, the mother of Jesus, as a universal mother. Someone who would be there to listen, understand, console and comfort us no matter what our problems and irrespective of our age. We might grow a beard or wear high heels but she would remain the same: unfailingly loving and tender. She was a permanent stream feeding the reservoir of generosity &#8211; because she was generous to us, we could afford to be generous to others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WLA_haa_Song_wood_Guanyin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7479" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/WLA_haa_Song_wood_Guanyin.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="WLA_haa_Song_wood_Guanyin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The figure of Guanyin played a similar role in Buddhist thought. She is the one who listens, offers comfort &#8211; and psychic nurturing &#8211; by hearing our troubles with infinite understanding. No problem was too big or too small to be heard compassionately. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such figures take very seriously the need for a maternal function; they emerge from a realisation that to cope with the pressures of life we need to feel understood and appreciated by someone, especially<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if many of the individuals we have to deal with (and serve olives to) conspicuously fail to treat us tenderly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The role they play is important. But there’s another option, if we find it difficult or impossible to believe in them. We have to become our own mothers. It’s not a warped fantasy of genealogy; and it’s not suggesting we literally start to resemble our own mums. The idea builds on a key fact about the mind. There are different aspects to our complex selves. There are ways we can be more childlike (more demanding of attention and help) or alternatively, there are moments when we adopt a more maternal attitude towards ourselves: we treat our own troubles and failing with kindness (just as a very nice real mother, or Guanyin) might. We tell ourselves the more supportive and compassionate stories about who we are. We remind ourselves that &#8211; in fact &#8211; we are decent people, a bit under pressure, of course &#8211; but well-intentioned. This side of the persona is quick to recall our strengths, to take the edge off self-criticism, to give our weaknesses the most charitable interpretation &#8211; and broadly to coax the ego back into shape.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3720850121_f8c220c910_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7481" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3720850121_f8c220c910_b.jpg?resize=635%2C530" alt="3720850121_f8c220c910_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve developed a suspicion of self-love based on (actually quite rare) cases where people are much too pleased with themselves. But almost inevitably our problems run in the opposite direction. The averagely decent human being is an expert at self-criticism and hesitant around appreciating their own merits. We’re not normally very good at replenishing our own reservoir of generosity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The care of the self means adopting a higher level of kindness towards ourselves &#8211; in the inner dialogues which dominate existence. The normal running commentary goes like this: ‘you fool, you’ve stuffed up again, why are you so weak and easily upset; you made a complete fool of yourself over the olives; it’s just like that time you started crying when Janine pointed out you’d let everyone down; pull yourself together you stupid weakling.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So we approach any genuine problem from a position of shame and disappointment. The maternal (Mary, Guanyin) voice has a very different line: ‘It’s a pity, you were trying, you always try so hard; it’s all right, it will pass; last week you handled that little disagreement with Marcus so well; you’re going to mange this time too; one cold day doesn’t mean it’s winter; you are such a good person at heart; and part of what&#8217;s nice about you is you worry you’ve let others down. So, it’s going to be OK. Deep down, you’re fine.’ The supportive words start to restore self-respect. They re-equip us to be a little more accommodating and generous to others. We can cope with their quirks and self-absorption, because we’re more secure in our sense of self-worth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is pointing to a key task of management in service-oriented companies. If you want your staff to provide good service, you have to replenish the reservoir of generosity in each of them. You have to be nice to them, if you want them to be nice to the customers. Encouraging self-nurturing in employees might be as &#8211; or more &#8211; important than getting them to read extracts from the health and safety manual. The point isn&#8217;t focused on external celebration, like giving an employee a cake on their birthday (though that’s not a bad idea). It’s more about being, at key times, like Mary or Guanyin, to the staff. You can’t make the problem go away; you can’t make customers be more polite or more considerate; but you can show you are tenderly aware of the pains of dealing with their concerns and deeply appreciative of the generosity it takes to keep on being nice to people who aren&#8217;t very nice back. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Expectations are violated</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong, and customers get upset, when expectations are not met. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/50.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7482" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/50.gif?resize=440%2C560" alt="50" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">William James &#8211; the brother of the novelist Henry James &#8211; defined the problem: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Happiness = result &#8211; expectation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If what you get is better than you expected, you have a positive experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If expectations are on the low side, the customer may be delighted by quite minor, but charming, levels of service. You mislay your ticket for a multi-storey car park and have to get the manager to help you. You’re expecting an awkward encounter: they’ll be irritated, you’ll be embarrassed. They turn it into a joke &#8211; it happens all the time, it’s not a problem at all, make a wry comment about the difficulty of trying to keep track of everything. You’re charmed. It’s still an ugly environment and it’s not cheap, but you feel a warm glow towards the place. In the future, you always park there whenever you are in the area (though there are two other car parks that are just as convenient). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if your expectations go above and beyond what you get, you feel disappointed and frustrated. It’s not the absolute merits of the service itself that is decisive: it’s how this stacks up against the picture we’ve formed in our heads of what it’s going to be like. This mental picture &#8211; or ‘expectations’ turns out to be a crucial element in the customer’s experience. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">High expectations around comfort: Luxury</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One big strategy, in the face of expectations, is to meet them, or go beyond them. The concept of luxury suggests that your high expectations will be fulfilled. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-residence-9_Wide.jpg.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/the-residence-9_Wide.jpg.jpg?resize=635%2C241" alt="the-residence-9_Wide.jpg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8216;A truly unique and bespoke travel experience, delivered with complete discretion and limitless hospitality &#8211; The Residence by Etihad.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has been created by leading interior designers and hospitality experts who understand the discernment and sophistication expected by the private traveller.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hope is to raise expectation in the market, so your competitor&#8217;s offerings will come to seem unimpressive. In comparison with the Etihad Residence, people come to feel that are roughing it in BA first class.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But it’s a dicey undertaking. Because if expectations are raised very high, even a tiny mishap (the champagne is the wrong temperature, the entertainment system has a glitch) can lead to high levels of disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the William James tragedy: you are judged against the hopes and fantasies &#8211; the expectations &#8211; of the customer, rather than the reality of your achievement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For Etihad &#8211; and many others &#8211; very high quality service (or luxury) is understood in terms of physical comfort: no one will disturb you; you won&#8217;t have to wait, you can stretch out, you can eat the most delicious things, drink rare wines, watch films on a large screen, have a shower. It&#8217;s the dominant conception of luxury around service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">High expectations around meaning: Adventure </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What counts as luxury will, of course, depends on the kind of activity in question. For instance, <strong>Alpine Ascents</strong> &#8211; the most successful mountain adventure company of the last decade &#8211; is classed as a ‘luxury’ service provider because it offers a plentiful supply of oxygen and good access to doctors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/65742649_67285258f9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7484" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/65742649_67285258f9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="65742649_67285258f9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Dru!</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike airline companies, Alpine Ascents tries to make the consumer’s expectations realistic: they are very worried about people having high hopes that in reality, can’t be fulfilled. This has worked well because their customer satisfaction ratings are extremely high. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– You have to be in very good physical condition, if you’re not, you can’t do the climb, no matter what you pay. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Instead of seeing luxury in terms of ‘we’ll do everything for you,’ Alpine Ascents aims to teach its clients greater levels of confidence and self-reliance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Alpine Ascents<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>aims to get its customers to appreciate the beauty and grandeur of the mountains. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn’t normally get excited by the idea of getting up at 2am, eating only instant nutrition bars, having a headache, getting very cold and struggling to force oneself to overcome fear and to keep going in spite of exhaustion: which are standard aspects of the experience of climbing a very high mountain. What Alpine Ascents and many other companies are trading on, however, is not simply the customer’s realisation that it will be like this &#8211; so they are not horrified by what actually happens when they get up towards the peak. <em>The key factor in expectations here is not just realism. It’s the idea that the experience is valuable, meaningful and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>worth it. It’s the expectation that ‘I’ll do all that hardship stuff and have a truly great time</em>.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of expectations, therefore isn’t just a tick list of specific features, or details you think the service will include. More importantly, it is shorthand for ‘what I think will make me happy’ in this part of life. And what companies like Alpine Ascents remind us is that we don’t only think that physical comfort will make us happy, we also believe that effort, risk, even hardship experienced in the right cause can be the path to happiness. We intuitively understand (though we easily forget around service) that happiness is as much about meaning and a sense of purpose, as it is about comfort. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Where expectations come from</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Expectations are not a permanent fixture: advertising influences our expectations, as do many wider features of the cultural landscape.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It took a very long time for climbing a mountain (and embracing all the hardship this entails) to be attractive to the consumer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, for example, mountains were not on the tourist map of Europe. The highly lucrative industry focused (to an extent that might now strike us as astonishing) on visiting Roman ruins. Mountains simply didn’t figure in this scheme of good travelling or the well-lived life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> But by the start of the 20th century, mountains had become one of the most fashionable and sophisticated destinations. The change in attitude was brought about by poets, artists, philosophers and novelists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7485" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains.jpg?resize=635%2C402" alt="morning-in-the-sudeten-mountains" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Caspar David Friedrich’s contribution wasn’t limited to showing people what such places might look like: expect to see crags and ridges of mountain chains. Rather, what he was doing was suggesting &#8211; arguing as passionately as he could visually &#8211; that such were the places where you could find the profound, most important, most exciting human experiences. This, he was saying, is what you need. Yes, it might take a long trek to get there, your fingers will get cold, you’ll feel dizzy at these heights. But it’s worth it. Because this is one of the key experiences of life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Caspar David Friedrich wasn’t formally employed by an advertising agency but, in effect, he was producing material for the Alpine Ascent account. So today, people relish sleeping in a small tent in a blizzard, breathing oxygen from a tank; feeling exhausted isn’t an objection, it’s part of the experience. An experience people would have paid to avoid is now a lucrative market. Not because it’s now ‘nicer’ but because expectations have shifted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The real driver of expectations is a vision of happiness &#8211; that is, of the good, meaningful experience that is part of the well-lived life. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of all service is to make the customer happy (or at least help them flourish) around some particular area of existence. So, good service in a plane is the kind of service that helps you thrive on a journey; good service in a hotel delivers the kind of help that enables you to thrive away from home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The provision of physical pleasures and the reduction of irritants (that is, the things that are typically associated with luxury) is one natural contribution to our well-being. It’s one kind of assistance we might need in order to thrive around some area of activity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The larger set of ‘eudaimonic needs’ (that is, things that help us flourish) includes six other factors: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– independence or self-reliance</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– sense of competence</span></p>
<p class="p1">– self-understanding</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– sociability (the feeling that others are in this too, that we are understood) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– resilience (our capacity to cope with setbacks) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a sense of adventure</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need these things in order to thrive. And without them, it will be very hard for us to feel we are having a great time (even if the pillows are beautifully fluffed and there is a careful selection of winter fruits to hand). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every business can ask itself what other needs (in addition to ease and comfort) it could be helping its customers with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Case Study: IKEA </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the right picture of what they are doing &#8211; the right expectations &#8211; people can come to love all kinds of things, that ordinarily we would imagine would be off-putting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16411054567_b802d1c51c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7486" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/16411054567_b802d1c51c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="16411054567_b802d1c51c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA have been one of the leading exponents of this move. At first sight, the idea of being told that you have to assemble your own bed feels like an affront. It’s degrading. Instead of being the customer, you have been co-opted as part of the workforce. You are too mean, or too poor, to buy an actual bed. You have to make do with just purchasing the raw materials out of which you will have to construct it yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What IKEA did was offer customers a very different picture of what it means to assemble your own furniture. That is, they fostered a different set of expectations, drawing on powerful ideas about self-reliance, an egalitarian spirit, a sense of the charm of Swedish modernism. When you are bolting the bits together you don’t feel resentful. You enjoy being this kind of person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it’s so important for them to emphasise their Swedishness &#8211; serving meatballs and gravlax in the cafe, having weird sounding names for things (the BÖRJE chair, the ALÄNG<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>table lamp) and to put pictures and insert mini bios of their designers in their catalogues. Henrik Preutz and Ebba Strandmark are there to promote an idea of an attractive kind of person: one who likes assembling things themselves, whose doesn’t feel it’s in any way degrading to push a vast cart around a warehouse, someone who has no status anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA don’t have to do all the work. We already have some very positive &#8211; though perhaps latent &#8211; associations with self-reliance (and putting together your own bed). In fact, this is a major theme of one of the great American books, Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em>, which tells in enchanting detail of the two years he lived in a little hut (which he built himself, in the ideal IKEA spirit).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/deskchair2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7487" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/deskchair2.jpg?resize=440%2C269" alt="deskchair2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The furniture Thoreau assembled: early advertising for IKEA</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thoreau was the ideal customer. He did not assemble his furniture himself because he was short of money. He was glad to get it cheaply, but there was another big thing in his mind. He wanted to do it himself. He liked the idea that he had put something of himself, his own effort and ingenuity, into the things he lived around. That’s what ready-assembled furniture couldn’t give him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IKEA, of course, was seeking profits. They worked out it was more profitable to get the customers to do some of the labour themselves. They could increase their margins by storing everything flat-packed in their warehouses. But the key insight was that customers would assemble the furniture not simply so as to save money, but because they liked doing it. The service IKEA offered was an attractive vision of the self as a furniture assembler &#8211; with this as a part of a nice, comfortable, interesting life. The power of IKEA depends on the fact that they have tapped into an important truth about life &#8211; and then organised a very efficient business around that. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Case Study: Airbnb</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Airbnb has revolutionised the travel industry by changing people’s expectations in a couple of key ways. Around: how you might feel about someone else staying in your place (which unlocked supply) and how you might feel about staying in someone else’s place (which unlocked demand). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Airbnb helped make accommodation cheaper. But their proposition wasn&#8217;t just about that. They were also arguing that other people are generally very trustworthy and that you too are trustworthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The <em>expectation shift</em> here is profound and intimate.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Central to the service is a vision of happiness around travel. They’re making the case that in order to travel well and have a good time, your attitude, your independence and your curiosity about meeting new people are important. And their service taps into these aspects of you &#8211; in ways that the traditional idea of the hotel does not. Airbnb is offering a lower level of service in some areas: they don’t provide room service or valet parking, there’s not going to be someone in a tailcoat to open the door. Rather than solve the problems around getting a sandwich at 3am, parking your car and opening the door,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Airbnb concentrates on addressing a different range of issues that are equally relevant to having a good holiday (and maybe rather more relevant). They’re connecting you with the more trusting, more generous, more confident, more self-reliant &#8211; which makes for a better trip. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alpine Ascents, IKEA and Airbnb are examples of service companies that have built great commercial success on the back of educating their customer’s expectations, which means they have promoted a particular insight into what can make us happy. The core move is that they are not only relying on the traditional luxury conception of happiness as physical comfort. That’s not wildly wrong &#8211; because physical comfort is a contribution to happiness. But there are many other factors that contribute as much to the flourishing life, like self-reliance, trust, a sense of adventure. Being helped to develop these aspects of oneself is a true service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> All service aims at making the customer happy. But service has typically focused on only a few of the things that could contribute to our happiness. Educating expectations really means helping us see how things we’ve not paid enough attention to can make a big contribution to our lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Thought experiments </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a thought experiment, we could imagine this move being made in other service areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hotel</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an advert for the Park Hyatt chain, George Clooney has to wait five minutes to check into the hotel. But he’s not seething. He knows patience is a virtue. He understands that sometimes things just do get a bit busy. He’s being mature about it. He looks at the little vignettes of life going on all around. The wise man is never bored, because the world is endlessly fascinating.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Even very well-run hotels are going to face such issues &#8211; at some point, three people are going to want to talk to the concierge or eight people need taxis at the same moment. In theory, all this could be solved with more and more staff. But this would lead to the hotel being in a different price bracket. The point is, being a mainstream luxury hotel still involves lots of little problems. The hotel is promoting the idea of the mature<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>guest who is well able to cope with these minor irritations. And who knows that instantaneous perfection is not the key to happiness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Airline</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">British Airways could promote the important virtue of not letting the unavoidable get you down. In economy, there’s a nicely dressed, modestly attractive woman squashed between two over-sized men. Then there’s an announcement that (through no fault of the airline) they’re going to have to wait on the tarmac for an hour and five minutes. She doesn’t roll her eyes or let out a long sigh. She’s going to be fine. She takes out a well-thumbed, much annotated paperback copy of the <em>Meditations</em> of Marcus Aurelius and starts reading, there’s just the tiniest smile on her face. She is being perfectly British, perfectly British Airways. Their slogan:<em> Rise Above Everything</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, she’s standing waiting to use the loo. A steward is passing with a tray and suddenly the plane lurches and the tray falls spectacularly to the floor. The stewardess is embarrassed and makes frantic apologies. Our nice woman bends down to help and gives a warm smile: you mustn’t worry, these things can’t be helped. It’s perfectly all right. She puts a little carton of orange juice back on the tray. <em>The best people fly BA</em>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wise patience and a stiff upper lip are real virtues. That is, they really do assist you in leading a happier life. The company that fosters them in their customers is doing those people a big service. They are getting more directly to the true goal of all service: the happiness of the customer. They are not excuses for sloppy service: the point is that unless we buy a much more expensive ticket (or, ideally a private jet) travel just is going to involve a range of difficult experiences. Helping us cope with those is a genuine and important service. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the top luxury end, the airline company might compete with Etihad not by offering an even larger bed or greater water pressure in the private shower, but by widening the range of needs that it addresses. Instead of just concentrating on the luxury of comfort, it could address other (currently sidelined) needs we might have around travel: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for accomplishment</em>: you can sit in the cockpit during landing or &#8211; under careful supervision, flick a switch that’s part of the sequence for engaging the autopilot, the pilot gives you a quick lesson.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for sociability</em>: have a cocktail with an interesting, distinguished or just rather lovely person on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>for participation</em>: take a brief call with a board member, or the head of marketing, to discuss your views of the company and the key challenges of the industry. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Tea at the Ritz </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tea service takes certain problems very seriously. Great attention and skill has been devoted to ensuring that the sandwiches while very thin are not soggy. They’ve worked out how to keep the teapot hot for half an hour and what the ideal density of tables is &#8211; you don’t want to feel crowded by others, but it’s nice to sense that other people are around: you can see them and they can see you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The Ritz does these things very well indeed. But other needs go unaddressed and are not yet on the agenda as things that good service can and should address. They are not rare needs or preferences (such as jam made from Californian Olallieberries). They are some of the main obstacles we might face when trying to have a sociable afternoon.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>Having one’s melancholy acknowledged</em>. One customer out of three is probably feeling a bit melancholy. It’s not that some terrible disaster has befallen them, they are just struck by the brevity of life or are conscious of how many opportunities they have let slip or they feel more acutely than usual how hard it is for people genuinely to understand one another. These are not problems to be solved, but perceptions to be acknowledged and perhaps shared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>What good service might include</em>: the demeanour of the waiter allows you to feel low-key, a bit withdrawn into yourself; they are not trying to jolly you along. An existentialist notepad and a set of psychoanalytic pencils is included as an item on the menu (i.e. something you might very naturally like to have at this time, just as you might also like to have a slice of cake).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– <em>The difficulty of conversing interestingly with people you might not know very well</em>. This is a major social need, but we are left entirely alone with it at the moment by the service provider. You are expected to bring your own conversation. In the future, this omission might look as strange as it would today to expect customers to bring their own milk, or their own tables with them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Good service could extend to</em>: an elegant conversation menu card is placed on the table as a matter of course &#8211; looking at one of these is not an admission of failure; here it is regarded as a wise and sophisticated thing to do. The hotel has a conversation code, just as &#8211; at the moment &#8211; it has a dress code: men are currently required to wear a tie and a jacket and jeans are barred. Equally, it could include an introduction service: you will be very nicely introduced to another individual or group. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of the company is to edge us towards a good set of expectations &#8211; that is a vision of the kind of help we’d ideally like and would benefit from getting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Trouble with details</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Service goes wrong when a detail is neglected that, unfortunately, has a big impact on the customer’s experience: an assistant seems aloof; the mini-bar fridge hums in the night; the toast is cold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daily life is filled with disconcerting examples of little things that have big consequences. You meet your partner in a bar after work and you start to mention that you’ve had a rather difficult day. They listen for a minute and then say in an off-hand manner: ‘poor you. Listen, you know the Jaguar XE, it’s now in production.’ You are deeply wounded. The problem is all in the details: it’s that when they said ‘poor you’, they were looking at their glass. And you are quite interested in the new Jaguar marque, but the timing was a problem; they didn’t pause between ‘poor you’ and mentioning the car. Two seconds would have been enough.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You seem to be upset by the tiniest things: your partner’s inferior rectus eye muscles momentarily contracted; they didn’t take a breath mid-sentence. It can all seem out of proportion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we can understand why. These details carry a large meaning: your partner doesn’t seem to care very much about what happened to you during the day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Or, someone doesn’t put the cap back on the toothpaste tube and it starts to drive their partner wild. It’s a small thing in itself but it means: this person is negligent and sloppy &#8211; right across life. The toothpaste is just the point where a bigger problem comes into focus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a commercial service context there are three issues around detail: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– noticing detail </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– understanding why a detail matters</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– being selective about which details to focus on</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s look at each in turn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Teaching sensitivity </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daily life desensitises us. We’re in a hurry; there’s so much noise, dirt, so much evidence of human sorrow &#8211; we start to shut it out. We stop noticing. It’s a very understandable form of self-defence. But this means that sometimes we’re not sensitive enough. We need to be re-sensitised to certain things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around service, the challenge is sometimes to get the staff to see and feel the importance of details which they usually don’t notice or especially care about. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Essentially, a detail is something that’s <em>easy to overlook</em>. So, in order to get good at dealing well with detail, we need to get into the habit of paying attention. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7494" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus.jpg?resize=635%2C531" alt="Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We wouldn’t usually pay a lot of attention to the visual details of a bunch of asparagus. But Manet was very sensitive to the attraction of the lilac tips, the white flesh of the stalk, the nice contrast with the bed of green leaves and the charm of binding them with thick golden-brown twine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Manet has directed a lot of attention in an unusual &#8211; but rewarding &#8211; direction. And when we’ve seen him do this, we start to get more sensitive ourselves: we become more attentive. We notice more details. We become more alert to the ways something can be more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- or less &#8211; attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy can do this too. For instance, it’s not very normal for people to think about how they stand &#8211; it’s not something modern culture tends to pay much attention to. But how an assistant or a waiter stands can make a big difference: without realising it, their posture communicates something to the customer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pompeo_Batoni_Italian_Lucchese_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7495" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Pompeo_Batoni_Italian_Lucchese_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="Pompeo_Batoni_(Italian_(Lucchese)_-_Portrait_of_John_Talbot,_later_1st_Earl_Talbot_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">18th-century portraits like this one showing an English aristocrat and his dog on holiday in Italy don’t literally show the ideal way to stand when serving someone a glass of orange juice and an almond croissant. What they do is sensitise us to the way posture is a form of communication: a language. They do this by showing us a posture that’s so unfamiliar that we can’t help noticing it. Through looking at an extreme case, we notice the relevant elements: the title of the head, the distance of the hands from the body, the alignment of the feet. It’s a vehicle for promoting sensitivity to detail. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What a detail is doing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In art and architecture, the role of the detail has long been taken very seriously indeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Parthenon, at the summit of the Athens Acropolis may well be &#8211; despite its ruinous state &#8211; one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. Certainly, it is one of the most influential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7496" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Parthenon-on-Acropolis-in-Athens-Greece" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Tiny details make all the difference</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the source of its visual magnetism isn’t at first obvious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The base on which the temple stands &#8211; for instance, isn’t actually flat. It curves very gently down from the middle. You’d not notice (unless you tried to lay a completely straight 20-metre iron bar on it). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The columns lean slightly towards the centre &#8211; again you can’t easily tell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/parthenon-curves.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7497" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/parthenon-curves.jpg?resize=440%2C625" alt="parthenon-curves" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The details <em>exaggerated</em>: in reality we can hardly see them</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such details can sound a bit obscure. But they are what make the building appear effortlessly poised, balanced and serene. Less accomplished architects didn’t realise that such details could make a big difference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same move (attending to a detail which helps produce an important overall effect) can be seen at work in a modern service context. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A great chef adds a little parmesan to the sauce, you might not know this. But you love the effect. The fish somehow seems more savoury than usual. They did a little thing &#8211; they grated a few grams of cheese &#8211; but it made a big difference. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A medium-sized accountancy firm might put very good art on the walls of the rooms where they have meeting with clients. They haven’t spent much money on them: they’re just some elegantly-mounted photographs (from, perhaps, X’s series: the life of accountants). It’s an eloquent detail. They are deftly signalling that they’ve got a good perspective on the world of tax law, returns, investments and asset management. Money is serious, of course, but it sits within the larger issue of getting one’s life to go well. This detail says: ‘We might be talking about the taxation aspects of renting out your holiday cottage in Cornwall (it might be best in your circumstances to set this up as a small business) but we haven’t forgotten that you are a human being.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7498" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7208800636_d82e40bf6a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A sales assistant in an upmarket clothes shop has a way of asking ‘can I help you?’ that feels both genuine and friendly: the tone in which they say these words is minutely different from a colder way of speaking. It’s a tiny difference, but it&#8217;s showing that here is someone who is really on the side of the customer, who has their best interests at heart. The detail is tiny but the meaning, for the customer, is large. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The smile of the person at the check-in desk could make up for having to stand in a queue for fifteen minutes to reach them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good service company works back to the detail by first understanding the important effect they are aiming at. Then they work back and ask themselves what little things that effect depends on. They don’t just randomly seize on some little thing and try to get that perfect. Their attention to this detail is motivated by a big ambition. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the same reasons, though, getting a little thing wrong can have a big effect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– In a cafe, the music is a little too loud: which implies that this isn’t a place to think or read or have a conversation. You can ask for it to be turned down &#8211; but the problem is they didn’t notice it on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/212469779_704a96767b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7499" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/212469779_704a96767b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C403" alt="212469779_704a96767b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– In a smart restaurant, the waiter hovers. There’s a major difference between keeping an attentive but discreet eye on how a diner is doing and being intrusive. It could make the difference between great and terrible service. But in physical terms we might only be looking at small details here: the distance the waiter is from the table; how relaxed they seem; whether they glance or stare. Hovering has a bigger, and negative meaning: lack of confidence. Hovering says: ‘I don’t know how to look after you.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– An airline prides itself on making announcements in six languages, a little touch designed to show their cosmopolitan character, but by the time they have interrupted your viewing of <em>House of Cards</em> for the fifth time to explain in Russian how to fasten a seatbelt, you are getting desperate and wish that anyone on board who can only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>learn to ‘clip it in as shown’ in this one language &#8211; despite it&#8217;s being mimed multiple times already &#8211; would simply disappear. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A car is designed in such a way that you can’t see the speedometer when you turn the steering wheel. It irks you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>all the time and &#8211; despite liking a lot of other things about the vehicle &#8211; you go for another make next time round. It’s a tiny thing, in a way: but it’s just cost the manufacturer your loyalty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Which details to pay attention to</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, artists were preoccupied with attending to <strong>every</strong> detail of appearance. If you asked them which details it was most important to get right they would say: ‘all of them’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7500" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e.jpg?resize=440%2C598" alt="61b4a5f102bdc55a7d084571e66e1b8e" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The English artist, John William Waterhouse (1849 &#8211; 1917)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>for instance, was typical in his attention to detail: he was precise about the creases of the neck and the shape of the cheekbone; he carefully noted every strand of hair. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, Matisse can seem terribly negligent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7501" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_19511" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we don’t look at Matisse and think: what a careless guy, why didn’t he pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>proper attention to her hair? He hasn’t even bothered to give her nostrils, or complete the outline of her eyes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Matisse wasn’t being shoddy. He was very concerned with<strong> some</strong> details: the angle of the head is really important, the position of her mouth is perfect, though it’s defined by only two strokes of the pen. The way her hair curls over her forehead is delightful, though it’s been presented with the greatest possible economy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He could afford to be selective &#8211; he could be economical &#8211; because he knew what he was aiming it: an effect of flirtatious sweetness, which actually doesn&#8217;t require much attention to every strand of hair or the shape of her cheekbones. In effect, he asked himself which details he likes. He finds this person’s face charming and he wants to identify the key factors. It’s not just everything about her face that’s sweet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The two, closely-connected moves that Matisse brings to our attention are: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– be selective about which details to concentrate on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– select the details that matter for achieving a particular goal or effect.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This move can be applied in various service areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Details of service for a serene hotel </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The staff are pleasant to talk to, but sometimes they will be a bit inefficient &#8211; they might read a book during a slack period. The relevant detail here is being rounded, natural and interesting, rather than focused on achievement. This has a calming effect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– They don’t have fridges in the rooms (there are very few things that need to be kept below room temperature in a bedroom), instead they have silent cooler boxes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The artwork is beautiful and tranquil.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The selection at breakfast is quite limited; they concentrate on perfect fruit juice and exceptional scrambled eggs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The films and content on the in-room television system are selected for their ability to provide calm perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5574612655_8afc0e4d82_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7502" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5574612655_8afc0e4d82_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="5574612655_8afc0e4d82_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Nicely-shaped rooms: simple shapes, harmonious proportions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Minor blemishes are tolerated: painting peeling from a bathroom ceiling or a cup-stained sideboard &#8211; serenity means not fussing too much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Details of service for a clothes store that welcomes nervous men</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The changing cubicles are quite large, they have doors that shut; the assistant knocks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The floor area is arranged so the customer can see themselves in a full-length mirror, while remaining inconspicuous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The service staff are not terribly well-dressed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Works of art and the manner of the staff encourage one to feel melancholy around clothes: it is so very unlikely you will get exactly what you want; and even if you do, you will never look the way you’d like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Details of service for a restaurant that helps families eat together</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The children’s menu is as carefully thought out as the adult one, paying very close attention to what children will eat: chicken served with a square of cheese and a dollop of ketchup exactly in the middle.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The restaurant has house ‘rules’ for children, which are strongly (but tactfully) promoted by the staff, which (like the ideal school) takes some of the burden off the parents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Staff might not be perfect at waiting (they occasionally muddle an order) but they are selected for their very good way with children. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Conversation exercises to engage a family as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: The art of apology is neglected</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inevitably around service things sometimes go wrong. The plane is delayed. The scrambled eggs are watery; the car-hire company has mixed up the booking; the architect has misunderstood a point you’d made clear. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When service goes wrong we want a couple of things to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>One</em>: we want the problem solved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Two</em>: we want an apology &#8211; we want people to recognise how painful this problem has been for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But companies often overlook the importance of saying sorry because they are focusing their efforts on trying to solve the problem. And because they fear that apologising opens you to attack: you are admitting you are wrong and people will make you pay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Saying sorry isn’t an excuse for poor service. Even very well-run service companies will make mistakes; it’s how you handle them that matters. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A good apology has two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>key components: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It demonstrates empathy: you put yourself in the shoes of the customer and identify with their suffering, frustration and anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It explains without being defensive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(The art of saying sorry is one of the ways commerce is like the rest of life: things we learn around work can help us.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How a problem is announced suggests how the provider is imagining the customer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9833022695_3ff34e6c70_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7505" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9833022695_3ff34e6c70_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="9833022695_3ff34e6c70_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are overseas and try to use a cash machine. For some reason the machine can’t help you &#8211; maybe they are out of cash or maybe the satellite connection between Verona and X (wherever VISA do their central things) has momentarily failed. The machine flashes you a terse announcement: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">You have been denied access to this service</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The curt refusal would make sense if you were trying steal some money. It sounds like a committee has sat in judgment on you and run a red line through your name. The announcement imagines that the customer is up to something disreputable. It’s very anxiety-provoking to be seen this way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead the bank could announce: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">We’re really sorry. There’s a glitch somewhere &#8211; we don’t know why. But we do know how maddening this is.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Very occasionally they will flash up this cheerful, kindly message to an identity fraudster. They could calculate the odds: 3,095 deeply anxious customers v. 1 gleeful (but not actually any the richer) fraudster. It’s a risk worth taking. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This apology is in effect saying: you and I are on the same side. We’d all like this service to be good. And, unfortunately, it isn’t right now. We’re remembering what it is like to be in your situation. We, too, have had moments when the cash machine wouldn’t accept a card. We weren’t trying to defraud someone. We were just people in a hurry being frustrated by a technical problem. We know that’s what you’re like too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Apology as explanation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 19th-century England, the rising start of the national Anglican church was a man called John Henry Newman.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>By his late thirties, he was the most influential figure in the Church of England. He was particularly admired for his harsh attacks on the Roman Catholic church &#8211; seen, in those days, as the natural enemy of the English church.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he turned forty, he changed his mind. He decided that, after all, the Catholics were right. He swapped sides &#8211; and became the leader of the Catholics instead.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7506" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="Portrait_of_John_Henry_Newman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">He embarrassed and upset his friends</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, he caused huge offence to a large number of people. His friends felt betrayed. A lot of people were very angry with him. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He responded by writing what he called an <strong>Apologia</strong>. It’s the autobiographical record of the experiences and ideas that lead him to swap sides. He didn’t just confront people with a brute fact: I used to agree with you, now I think you’re wrong. He told the story of the small steps that took him from where he had to been to where he was now. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An apologia is like an apology &#8211; but there’s one key difference: you don’t think you’ve actually done anything wrong. You know that other people are very upset. And you take their hurt and annoyance very seriously indeed. You’re not surprised they are angry &#8211; though you believe that if they knew the whole story, they would be much more forgiving and accepting. They might even come to share your point of view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An apologia is an explanation that engages with how upset and annoyed other people are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The situation Newman found himself in is familiar in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>commercial service context. The customer is unhappy and upset. The company maybe isn’t actually to blame. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This happens a lot around the rail system.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the station, the train operator flashes up the stark message: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 11.30 to Bristol Temple Meads has been cancelled. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The frustrated passenger crowded on the platform has a picture of the rail company: they are lazy, they make dopey blunders, they don’t care about the passengers. The delay is entirely their fault; if they were more competent, this wouldn’t happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the point of view of the train operator, it all looks very different. The delay has been caused by something the rail company has no control over: wet leaves are sticking to the rails and reducing traction and making breaking difficult. It’s so bad they are going to have suspend the service and send in a special vehicle to clean the tracks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If the train companies were to say more about what is going on, their first instinct might be to show their irritation. They could be tempted to broadcast a message like this: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘It’s the leaves, not us. Why can’t you understand that? Quit complaining.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What they need to do is undertake an apologia: an explanation that’s specifically geared to acknowledging and diffusing the anger the passengers feel.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Britain has lovely trees; it’s a great thing about this country. We’ve all had moments when we’ve been touched by their beauty and quiet dignity. But trees cause difficulties too. In October and November, when the leaves fall, it often rains; inevitably, damp leaves end up on the rails. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When trains run over them, the pressure of the wheels make these leaves stick very tightly to the top of the rails. A kind of slippery leaf coating builds up on the track and the trains can’t break properly. So the line has to be cleaned. We used sand, a special citrus-based cleaning agent to remove the build up. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The deepest form of apology is to share with another person the real nature of the task; to say &#8211; ultimately &#8211; we are trying to do this fascinating thing. We’re trying to provide a reliable rail service in a country that loves trees and woodland. It’s one instance of a huge civilisation-defining task: how can we have beauty and efficiency at the same time? Unfortunately, aiming at both these things means that sometimes there are going to be difficult moments. This is one of them. We’re really sorry it is your journey that is being messed up today. We know that’s maddening but we hope you’ll bear with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They aren’t simply saying, we’re very sorry. They’ve got a bigger ambition. Like Newman, the rail company is offering an apologia: an explanation of what is really going on. They are trying to lead the customer from their suffering to an understanding of the bigger issue that’s at stake. In the belief that understanding will soften the irritation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">How much inconvenience people will put up with, in the name of a grand cause: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the 18th of June 1940, Charles de Gaulle made a radio speech from the Broadcasting House in London.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/48092167_001215507-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7511" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/48092167_001215507-1.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="_48092167_001215507-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve made a lot of mistakes but we’re going to keep trying </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">France had just been invaded, the army was in disarray. He himself had fled a couple of days before. He admitted many mistakes had been made.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He was asking for the support and loyalty of French people everywhere. He didn’t have much to offer them. He couldn’t offer people security or a salary. Nevertheless, many thousands of people instantly responded. And we understand why: eventually they were going to recover their country and restore its honour. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Mistakes have been made, there have been delays and untold suffering, but the fact remains that there still exists in the world everything we need to crush our enemies some day.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">De Gaulle understood that people are motivated by many things and amongst the strongest motivators is participation in a great project.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7512" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees.jpg?resize=635%2C466" alt="General_Charles_de_Gaulle_and_his_entourage_set_off_from_the_Arc_de_Triumphe_down_the_Champs_Elysees" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">One day we will make it here: the grand cause justifies the pain and the effort</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">De Gaulle represents the extreme version of a general, widespread point. Human beings are remarkably good at putting up with difficulties if they believe the cause is worthwhile: parents get up in the middle of the night to feed their babies and life-boat crews will face appalling seas. Or, in sport we’ll make ourselves keep running to complete the half-marathon or get up at five in the morning to perfect one’s backstroke when the pool is empty. They all point to the same psychological fact: it’s not being uncomfortable in itself that bothers people; it’s the feeling of having to put up with inconvenience for no very good reason. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ten: We don’t understand what’s good about good service</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to think that the range of things that can be learned is quite limited. You can learn to polish silver or to carry a tray or make a safety announcement. But you can’t learn to smile warmly or be more empathetic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the reasons service goes wrong is that it isn’t ambitious enough around the idea of education. We don’t spend enough time studying role models of good service. In the past, religions made great use of this move. They’d encourage people to think a<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>lot about what an ideal role model would do in particular circumstances. Christianity, of course, was always asking people to think about what Jesus or one of the saints might do or say at challenging moments. There were many images of the charitable actions of St. Francis of Assisi &#8211; for instance, of the time he gave away his spare blue cloak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7524" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm1.jpg?resize=222%2C371" alt="sassetta-saint-francis-poor-knight-franciss-vision-NG4757-fm" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">A reminder of how you might ideally treat others in need</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The basic principle is a general one: we can learn to do things better by paying close attention to what the best people are doing and understanding what it is they are getting right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the best waiters in the world is Stefano Lombardi who works at the Hotel de Russie, near Piazza del Popolo in Rome. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7514" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="stefano-gegnacorsi-general-232072" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">He is dignified</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dignity might not be the first word that comes to mind when we think of the good server. But what it means is that the server’s self-respect isn’t on the line. They’re already sure of their own worth. So they don’t need to prove it to the customer. Stefano behaves naturally. His politeness is never forced or fake. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Stefano remembers the humanity of those he serves </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He knows that someone might be a bit down, that life has many difficulties that a <em>caffè freddo</em> cannot solve. So he’s not attempting to ensure that his customers are jolly and bright all the time. Rather, he’s attuned to their mood. He might be serving a quail-egg omelette and yet signal with a wry smile that &#8211; after all &#8211; it is only an omelette. And no matter how nice or exotic it is, it cannot repair a damaged marriage or undo a deal that’s gone sour or bring a father and son closer. He’s not pretending it can. What you feel, as he gently puts the plate down, is his discreet sympathy. It’s not anything he says. It’s what he’s thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3590261638_fe567f13b5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7515" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3590261638_fe567f13b5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3590261638_fe567f13b5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘When I look at some of the people who come in here, I think, there’s a nice person who is having a rough day. Maybe they just want to be quiet; maybe they want to forget their troubles for a little while. Maybe they just need someone to treat them with kindness after a few too many bruising experiences. I’m always alert for the little signals that show me what&#8217;s going on for a customer. I never judge them. I never badger a customer. I don’t suggest: would you like this, or why don’t you try that, until I’ve got a sense of what’s going on for them.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">He treats each customer as an individual </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plastic or robotic service means treating all customers in the same way. The server wishes the person a good day, not because they wish this specific individual a good day, but because they say it to everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal service company would have a statue of its version of Stefano in their head offices. New service staff would be told stories about him, and maybe they’d get to meet him one day. They’d be encouraged to ask ‘what would Stefano do’ in tricky situations: when a customer is complaining unreasonably; when you’ve made a slight mistake and want to apologise; when a couple is lingering too long at a table when they’ve finished their meal; when a customer is making too much noise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single most important secret Stefano possesses, however, is his conviction that what he does matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Being kind to other people is one of the central tasks of life. Good service means, in effect, kindness: understanding what another person needs, treading delicately when you find a sore spot. I may only be bringing them a cup of tea or a glass of prosecco. But it represents something universal: cheerful generosity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Conclusion </strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting good at service involves creating the right internal culture in a company. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the second Saturday of April each year, people in New York with Scottish ancestry dress up in kilts and tartan socks, play the bagpipes and parade up 6th Avenue (starting from W45th Street). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> They are teaching themselves ‘Scottishness’. The rest of the time they might be taxi drivers, investment analysts, stay-at-home parents and high school teachers. But for a little while they are reconnecting with and strengthening this particular part of their identity. The people who established the parade had exactly that in mind. They were acutely aware of how easily a sense of national identity could get eroded in New York. So they set out deliberately to encourage it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are picking up on a basic fact about people: we are usually very open to suggestions about how to behave. In an art gallery, we move more slowly, we talk quietly, we feel very respectful towards authority. We are highly responsive to environmental cues about how to behave. The organiser of New York’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>tartan march don’t leave the environmental signals to chance: they have particular songs, stories, poems, special clothes, food, musical instruments, flags. Each item operates with the same core conviction: certain things that go on<em> outside</em> affect what goes on <em>inside us</em>. The kilts, haggis, bagpipes and feathered caps are all used in order to promote a set of emotions: pride and loyalty. They get people to<em> feel</em> Scottish by surrounding them with <em>signs</em> of Scottishness. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Corporate identity is fostered using the same mechanism. The company can foster a culture of good service by marshalling a helpful set of signals: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The CEO shows their own dedication to service.</em> The CEO happens to be running the show; but they believe in the dignity of the service the company offers. They can still serve, occasionally. Service isn’t something you get promoted out of. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. The Shame of Selling</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A lot of the reasons why our efforts to sell things go wrong is an underlying feeling that ‘selling’ is a bad thing to do. We’ve internalised an image of selling drawn from capitalism’s worst moments, which gives rise to a suspicion that selling somehow injures those to whom we sell.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arthur Miller’s play <em>Death of a Salesman</em> &#8211; first performed in 1949 &#8211; is full of pathos and compassion climaxing around the death of Willy Loman, the exhausted, disappointed, middle-aged salesman of the title. The play has been hugely successful, moving audiences from Broadway to China to tears. We feel Willy was an ordinary, good-enough man &#8211; who deserved but didn’t get a fair share of happiness and fulfilment. His life as a salesman left him crumpled and defeated.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He never accomplished anything; his life was wasted. ‘Salesman’ becomes the name of a person who lived a crummy, inauthentic life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-3422290.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7229" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-3422290.jpg?resize=635%2C600" alt="Death Of A Salesman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to paint a grim portrait of the salesperson: someone constantly looking out for some way to take advantage of whomever they meet and trying to sell friends and strangers things they can’t afford. A salesperson is someone whose smile can’t be trusted; someone living a life of lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, the moral status of a salesperson isn’t fixed, it all depends on the value of what they are selling. When a doctor urgently recommends surgery to the stomach, we don’t think of this as an act of ‘salesmanship,’ because the procedure (though it might make money for many people along the way) seems plainly and objectively necessary.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/203408503_87e70c707a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7233" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/203408503_87e70c707a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="203408503_87e70c707a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Mo Riza</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bad image of selling is a consequence of the experience of selling stuff that is unaligned to people’s genuine needs: like too many Krispy Kreme donuts or a Cotoletta Veneziana in a tourist-trap restaurant off the Grand Canal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve got many vivid pictures of dishonourable selling. But we don’t yet have a correspondingly clear sense of the honourable version. Good selling means uniting an audience with things it really requires to flourish, which means that there is a lot more scope for honest selling than we are perhaps currently ready to acknowledge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Honourable salesmanship requires a sense of the possibility of honourable capitalism. This doesn’t mean a world in which we’re only trying to sell organic beans and rope sandals. Many companies are already doing good &#8211; they’re selling reliable dishwashers and nicely designed garden furniture, good quality skin moisturiser or excellent paper clips. But even these companies often have an unhelpful sense of what they need to tell the world in order to sell their products &#8211; and in the process, they lose sight of the good they actually do. Good salesmanship starts with a feeling that there can be such a thing as selling someone something they really require to flourish. It means overcoming the shame of being in sales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Exaggeration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the many ways in which salesmanship goes wrong is through a feeling that we need to exaggerate the virtues of a product, service or person &#8211; to prove acceptable to a buyer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands Board of Tourism is responsible for marketing the Dutch countryside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beautiful_holland_1400x1050.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7181" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/beautiful_holland_1400x1050.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="beautiful_holland_1400x1050" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">To lure visitors, it has decided to employ images of very neat windmills by pristine canals, with flowers along the banks &#8211; and extremely sunny skies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are indeed occasional places and a few days of the year when the Netherlands is actually like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But there are many other aspects of the Dutch countryside that the Board of Tourism stays quiet about: it’s often overcast, there are many places where there’s not a flower to be seen, and there’s always quite a lot of mud. You’ll encounter many a wonky old sluice gate and some rickety pailings shoring up the bank. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To avoid annoying and disappointing their customers, the team at the Netherlands Tourist Board should ideally have consulted a painting in the nation’s main art gallery, the Rijksmuseum, by the 17th-century artist Jacob van Ruisdael. Van Ruisdael loved the Dutch countryside, he spent as much time as he could there, and he was very keen to let everyone know what he liked about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead of carefully selecting a special (and unrepresentative) spot and waiting for a rare and fleeting moment of bright sunshine, he adopted a very different ‘selling’ strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7182" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1.jpg?resize=635%2C524" alt="The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling the Netherlands</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His most famous painting is an advert for the qualities he discovered. And they’re much more representative of what Holland is generally like. He loved overcast days. And so he carefully studied the fascinating characteristic movements in the sky: he was entranced by the infinite gradations of grey and how you’ll often see a patch of fluffy white brightness drifting behind a darker, billowing mass of rain cloud. He didn’t deny there was mud or that the river and canal banks are sometimes quite messy. Instead he noticed their special kind of beauty and made a case for it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands Tourist Board, like so many corporations, felt the reality of what it was selling was unacceptable and so had to resort &#8211; for the nicest reasons, out of modesty &#8211; to lies. But the Dutch countryside is filled with merits: it’s quiet and solemn. It encourages tranquil contemplation. It’s an antidote to stress and forced cheerfulness. These are things we might really need to cope with our overloaded and often plastified lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not only corporations that go in for exaggeration. It’s a standard move in all selling. It’s going on when a parent encourages a hesitant teenage child to learn French because, as they put it, it’s the language of love and haute cuisine and because Paris is at the centre of the fashion world. These are attractive notions. But actually learning the language will likely prove a huge disappointment if it is sold in these exaggerated terms, because what the thirteen-year-old is really being sold is Tuesday mornings trying to remember which verbs take être and evenings in their bedroom trying to work out the difference between the past perfect and the past imperfect tenses. Which won’t feel like it has much to do with the little black Chanel dress. The parent’s selling strategy didn’t rest on an untruth. It just deployed an exaggeration. And exaggerations are always likely to lead to trouble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15874483941_d29d1c1976_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7246" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/15874483941_d29d1c1976_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="15874483941_d29d1c1976_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They could, instead, have tried to identify the real merits of learning a tricky language: that one gets practice in doing things that are difficult (which is an ideal preparation for much of life); that the experience of gradual but real progress is an important one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or that cultivating a habit of getting exact about fiddly things (like tenses) is maybe just the training they need to balance out their inclination to be vague. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What matters in all acts of truly successful, honest selling is an honourable foregrounding of a thing’s actual virtues &#8211; and a confidence that these virtues will in time prove enough. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not so easy to sell this way, because it requires an all-too elusive confidence to sidestep the standard over-sunny stock approaches. But it’s a confidence that should emerge from an understanding of human psychology: we’re all very prepared to accept the less than perfect, if only we can be guided with skill and charm. Exaggeration is a nervous first move in salesmanship. But, as we know yet keep forgetting, things sell best over the long term when the real merits of things are brought out, even if those merits happen to be rather quiet and modest.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Idealisation </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad salesmanship believes that seduction requires idealised presentations of life: perfect health, strength, vigour, purposefulness, beauty, family dynamics and love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the way Jaguar has been selling its cars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aod-jaguar-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7183" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/aod-jaguar-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="aod-jaguar-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He’s in perfect shape, his body is at one with his mind &#8211; the ideal instrument of his masculine will; he never gets rebuffed. He doesn’t get assailed by the feeling that his life might be meaningless. He’s not prey to regret, shame, embarrassment or the nagging feeling that he’s a disappointment to his parents. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When confronted with sales pitches like this, we’re likely to recoil. It’s not because we don’t find the images attractive: they’re lovely. It’s because we know in our hearts that our lives (and our bodies) are not much like those on display in the ads. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike the character in the Jaguar, a man of forty might have an unreliable libido (he tries not to think of the fiasco on a business trip to Milan); sex with his partner has become a matter of begging. His stomach is starting to hang over his belt, and the bald patch at the back of his head makes him want to weep. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies are missing an opportunity. They might be able to sell more by acknowledging the truth about people’s lives. The solution lies in reminding ourselves of the charm of not idealising. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The appeal of realism is not so well known in commerce; but it’s got a great track record in art. The Italian sculptor, Antonio Canova &#8211; who was at the height of his career in the last years of the 18th Century &#8211; specialised in making marble figures more perfect than any we might encounter in the flesh. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7185" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777.jpg?resize=635%2C571" alt="903px-Psyche_revived_Louvre_MR1777" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But consider the paintings of Rembrandt for a quite different approach to physical beauty. One of the people Rembrandt thought most lovely in the world was Hendrickje Stoffels. And because he painted this portrait of her, a lot of other people find her delightful too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7186" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167.jpg?resize=635%2C581" alt="Rembrandt_-_Portrait_of_Hendrickje_Stofells_-_WGA19167" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But she’s not conventionally very beautiful. Her neck is quite fleshy, her cheeks are round rather than chiseled, and her mouth is rather small. She’s not very thin either. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s interested in her appearance. She wants to look good. She’s arranged her hair carefully. She’s put on earrings. She’s looped a golden chain seductively around her neck. She’s rouged her lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yet her face is so appealing not because it is geometrically perfect, but because it seems to convey what’s alluring about her personality: she could get quite sad and thoughtful, she could get confused and embarrassed. She could get angry at times, but she’d likely be quite ready to forgive. She’s warm. She looks as if she could be very understanding. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we feel we want to look great, it doesn’t mean we want to be perfect. It means we want to be liked and appreciated for what we feel might be most important about our natures. The average fashion brand could profitably imagine what it would be like to employ Rembrandt to devise some advertising for them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wouldn’t start with physical issues &#8211; what can I do about my thin lips, how can I disguise my wrinkles, I’d like my nose to be less prominent &#8211; though he’d get to them later. He’d start by defining attractiveness, rather than perfect beauty. And he’d build an initial campaign round the idea; what do the very beautiful really want: do they want to be liked? He’d be driving a psychological wedge between two ideas we’ve confused: physical beauty and attractiveness. Physical beauty is a guess about what’s genuinely appealing. But it can’t be quite right because Hendricjke is<em> more</em> attractive than the average supermodel, though by the standards of physical beauty Hendrickje is far less perfect. He’s advertising a fundamental truth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s return to the landscape. Up until the early years of the 19th century, the English landscape was painted in idealised terms. Artists would go to Italy and look at sunsets over the bay of Naples or climb hills and gaze down at sun-kissed plains; they delighted in serene skies and feathery trees. And when they returned to Derbyshire or Surrey they’d paint these places in the same Italianate terms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Syon-Richard-Wilson-1760-70.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7187" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Syon-Richard-Wilson-1760-70.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="E0702 WILSON 14559" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Richard Wilson, <em>Syon House</em>, c. 1761</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John Constable, on the other hand, got interested in identifying the real charms of the English landscape as he actually saw them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hampstead-heath.jpgLarge.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hampstead-heath.jpgLarge.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="hampstead-heath.jpg!Large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A cloudy sky could be lovely, the sandy colour of a gravel pit is actually very nice; the dumpy little hills are sweet. Instead of pretending the place lived up to an impossible ideal, he became very attentive to its odder but still very real attractions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like Rembrandt or Constable, a series of adverts used by VW in the 1970s explore the appeal of the ordinary and the allure of candour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image19.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7189" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image19.png?resize=635%2C596" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image12.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7190" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image12.png?resize=635%2C607" alt="image12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like a charming, mature person, the ads are able to admit that the product isn’t ideal. VW have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>confidence in experience, which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>teaches us that no one’s life is remotely ideal. You can honestly admit some problems and still be pretty good overall. The real virtues are still there, despite the drawbacks. In reality, we all accept this all the time. The job is far from perfect, but it’s still a decent place to work. The children’s school is far from perfect, but it does some things very well. And anyone seeking perfection in a partner is guaranteed to be miserable. But we get nervous around such obvious ideas when it comes to selling. The approach VW uses here is charming because it addresses us as the adults we really are. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Incidentally, VW have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>themselves more recently become infatuated with Canova &#8211; unfortunately for the appeal of their advertising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image29.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7191" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image29.png?resize=635%2C449" alt="image29" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve become worried about the ordinary. They’ve been corrupted by the Romantic idea that to be good something has to be unusual. (Which is &#8211; ultimately &#8211; a tragic idea because it implies that we’re almost all bound to be unhappy, since by definition almost everyone’s life will be ordinary). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jaguar are making more upmarket cars; so it’s not really their vehicles they might be winningly modest about. It’s the drivers. Rather than fabricate an ideal, polished customer, they could be sweetly candid about the driver’s likely shortcomings. We’d suggest a campaign built around slogans of this kind: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your marriage is a bit of a disappointment, fortunately your car doesn’t have to be. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your performance is unreliable; Jaguar’s isn’t. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It’s lean, even if you’re not. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It will make you look more impressive than you actually are. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Driving a Jaguar is where life makes sense. Life is where it doesn’t. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The campaign is making friends with the potential customer by &#8211; like a real friend &#8211; liking them, while being perfectly aware of their imperfections. A friend doesn’t like you because they’ve failed to notice the ways you are considerably less than ideal. They appreciate your merits and and sympathise with your tribulations and weaknesses. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The typical modern advert is <em>Romantic</em>. That is it adopts one of the key ideas of the Romantic Movement which dominated European and US culture in the 19th century and whose effects are still very much with us. Specifically, they buy into the conviction that only the special can be good. They associate the notion of being ordinary with failure and dreariness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/688px-George_Gordon_Byron_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7258" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/688px-George_Gordon_Byron_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_2.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="688px-George_Gordon_Byron,_6th_Baron_Byron_by_Richard_Westall_(2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, the <em>Classical</em> vision of culture is interested in, and enthusiastic about, the good ordinary. The classical outlook is very keen that the average should be nice. It assumes that what is normal can also be great. The task isn’t to make sure that one focuses on what no one else has. Rather the real business of culture &#8211; and of commerce &#8211; is to make what is common also rather good. From the classical point of view, to brand a product as ‘exclusive’ is to admit defeat. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Idealisation is the enemy of the good ordinary. It is a problem that afflicts us not only in the marketplace, but in personal relationships too. So often in relationships we dream of how wonderful life could be, if only… And it leads us to under-rate the value of the more commonplace, but genuinely good things that are within our grasp.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There’s a kind of salesmanship that doesn’t only get better at tapping into our needs; but which &#8211; along the way &#8211; helps us recognise, and properly esteem, the worth of the life we are mainly required to live: an ordinary one. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Underconfidence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Japanese aesthetics manages to get excited about things which are, on first hearing about them, desperately<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>unprepossessing. They talk enthusiastically about moss, drafts and &#8211; especially &#8211; broken pots.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7192" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="Tea_bowl_fixed_in_the_Kintsugi_method" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of <em>kintsukuroi</em> &#8211; which means <em>more beautiful because it has been broken</em> &#8211; helps direct attention to an easily missed appeal. The Japanese enthusiasts are not pretending. The repaired pot really is beautiful. It’s just that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if you come to it with unhelpful preconceptions you’ll dismiss it out of hand –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and never get round to noticing its charm. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Concepts like ‘kintsukuroi’ are in the selling business. They’re not initially charging money for a product or a service, so it doesn’t look like selling. But Japanese aesthetics are selling in the more fundamental sense of persuading someone to appreciate and want something. And further down the line people will be willing to pay to have this sort of thing. So there’s a market in Japan for nicely repaired bowls &#8211; a branch of commerce that is not yet much evolved in Sydney or Manchester. And in Japan, the value of a property will be augmented by the fact that the little tea house in the tiny garden has especially good drafts that cause the paper scrolls to flutter in a way people (in suburban Yokohama) have come to find enchanting.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point isn’t that we should get interested in building up businesses supplying pre-smashed crockery or installing drafts in people’s homes. Rather, these case studies teach us a useful kind of confidence. Things that might easily be thought unworthy of appreciation can &#8211; if described in the right way &#8211; emerge as attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People who have learned how to sell broken pots and imperfect insulation might have something to teach us about marketing things we currently regard as ‘low’ and unworthy of much attention: air conditioning units, filing cabinets or cereal packets (which we’ll be looking at in more detail in section 5). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/13778195773_f573732151_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7265" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/13778195773_f573732151_z.jpg?resize=635%2C403" alt="13778195773_f573732151_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The general thought, which we meet here repeatedly, is that good people panic around selling. They head too quickly to what they assume is the only thing the target audience will tolerate. If you speak about less familiar merits or demerits, you fear people won’t come on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This doesn’t just apply to commercial situations. You might be going to get married and feel that you have to have a wedding with an elaborate dinner with seven courses when in truth you feel it would be lovely just to have cheese sandwiches and mini Twix bars &#8211; the wedding equivalent of a smashed pot. But you instantly dismiss this from your mind as ‘impossible’. People won’t get it. Your partner will object, the guests will be disappointed. What you are held up by is not something actually wrong with your idea. In fact, it could be an extremely happy occasion. And in reality &#8211; you feel sure &#8211; most people hardly notice what they’re eating on such occasions. You’ve got a good case, but you don’t make it because it feels too weird. We’re very scared of rejection. We’ve created a fragile social environment in which unless you boost, it will be rejected: unless you emphasise how elaborate the occasion will be you’ll look cheap or mean or antisocial. The people, actually very few of them, who do feel intently that weddings should be highly complicated have projected their attitude strongly, with desperate effectiveness. They’ve made it look as if this is the only plausible option. When it really isn’t.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us probably love a grandmother and a child &#8211; people who, almost inevitably, by the standards of the world are nothing terribly special, maybe a bit difficult or awkward in a hundred ways. We know how to do this: love imperfection with boundless enthusiasm, because we do it all the time. Inbuilt into life is a rich capacity to love what is imperfect, starting with our loved ones. But we lose confidence in this actually widespread capacity. We panic and forget that others actually can readily activate this side of themselves &#8211; and that this is in fact the task of selling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we miss the opportunities for ‘selling’ (speaking of the virtues of) things that many people might like &#8211; a sandwich at a wedding, a repaired pot, a beaten-up table, if only it were confidently offered. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Shouting</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At breakfast, you are confronted by a smallish portable billboard, which also doubles as a container for cereal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7193" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="picture 61989" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s quite a lot it wants to communicate &#8211; with the goal of getting us to drop a packet into the trolley next time we’re at the supermarket. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Their breakfast offering is going to charge into your life like a train rocketing towards you across the wheat fields of the Midwest. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The product is bursting with energy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– It’s filled with sunlight and big skies and made from perfect ears of corn. And you mustn’t forget its nutritional advantages either. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the box is worried. It’s anxious that you might not be paying proper attention. It imagines that the ambient noise at this moment is quite high &#8211; maybe you’re listening to news of a political scandal, perhaps you’re glancing at the weather forecast; maybe you’re coordinating the day with your partner or trying to think where your child’s Peppa Pig wellington boots could be hiding.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With all this competition around a Weetabix box wants to cut through and make you listen to what it has to say. And to do this it <em>shouts</em>. Weetabix uses the strongest colour contrasts, they ramp up the intensity: the sunrise is explosive; the sky is intensely blue; the wheat is perfectly golden;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the lettering is huge, they make point blank assertions of the virtues of their product. Every bit of the surface has been made use of to keep the volume as high as possible. If they could, they might fit flashing lights and a claxon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are other ways in which messages get across and win our attention in a crowded world. Shouting isn’t the only option: it’s just a very familiar one at the moment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An alternative to using a loud voice was explored by the English artist Ben Nicholson (1894–1982). He specialised in a very low-key, semi-abstract approach to scenes of everyday life. He wanted to dim the volume of what he was saying so much that others would have to turn down the ambient noise. </span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nicholas-tate_1246954i.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7194" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nicholas-tate_1246954i.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="nicholas-tate_1246954i" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Packaging for a breakfast-time product</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He muted the colours (he was very fond of light grey); he used delicate harmony and clear, simple shapes to impress us. He realised that &#8211; for all that’s going on around us &#8211; we’re actually very responsive to certain dim signals. Something can stand out from the crowd precisely because it is quiet. His works are very calm and self-possessed. It’s a quality we recognise and like in people. It’s the person who doesn’t have to raise their voice to be listened to, the speaker who can hold the attention of a room even though they speak without assertion and pause between sentences. They’re not mumbling or bashful. There’s a real, convincing, authority behind their words. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7195" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926.png?resize=635%2C584" alt="ben-nicholson-1926-still-life-with-fruit-version-2-1926" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ben Nicholson had the confidence to know we could be charmed by a bowl of fruit on a modest<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>table. We could warm to subdued tones. We could like the simple outlines and rapid hinting of shapes. Many people happily hang images like this on their walls at home: the average Ben Nicholson costs many millions now. Yet the designers working for Weetabix forget this side of us when they’re planning the look of their boxes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shouting gets attention, but it doesn’t persuade. It doesn’t change hearts and minds. We’re really seeking not just to get someone to notice us, but to understand and appreciate the point we’re making. We ideally want them to listen carefully. And for getting that result, Ben Nicholson offers a vital lesson. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. Cheeriness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Across history, the articulation of melancholy attitudes has won immense audiences &#8211; Keats, Baudelaire, Amy Winehouse and thousands of singers enchant us with their appreciation of the sorrows of existence. We’re deeply attracted to their ability to speak of the more sombre aspects of life: we love and get left; our hopes are routinely frustrated; people we need get ill, they die; so many lovely things are fleeting. Summer passes, a friend moves away, one’s hair thins.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult and that suffering and disappointment are core parts of universal experience. It’s not a disorder that needs to be cured. The good life is not one immune to sadness, but one in which suffering contributes to our development. Sometimes you feel sad and you can’t quite put your finger on why. It’s not one acute sorrow that’s eating you. You feel in a way the whole of life calls for tears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_5001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7222" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_5001.jpg?resize=500%2C530" alt="tumblr_mt4aldYJHv1sqtg05o5_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy sells</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet advertising almost always forgets this. It is relentlessly cheerful. There has hardly ever been a melancholy advert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-952391.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7279" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-952391.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="evian-mineral-water-muscles-and-joints-small-95239" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re amazingly cheerful over here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling is mesmerised by the idea that when we feel a bit sad &#8211; when we’re touched by melancholy &#8211; what we need is to be at once very vigorously cheered up. It’s not a silly idea and sometimes it works. But by only using this approach the salesperson misses the opportunity to reach us in other ways. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The central move of melancholy art &#8211; in songs and poetry especially &#8211; is to comfort and help us by not trying to cheer us up. It’s a move we understand intuitively in the darker times of our own emotional lives. The sympathetic friend doesn’t pretend that all is well. They don’t say, it doesn’t matter that your parent has died, that you’ve been retrenched from work, that the novel you’ve been working on for seven years has been rejected for the 22nd time. They do us the honour of acknowledging our sadness and recognising that it is called for. In the darkness, they stretch out a hand. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of not trying to cheer people up &#8211; but of offering another kind of kindness &#8211; was at the heart of the work of the French poet Charles Baudelaire (1821 – 1867). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7198" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="Étienne_Carjat,_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire,_circa_1862" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Baudelaire was extremely well acquainted with grief. He had a miserable relationship with his socially prominent stepfather; he was addicted to gambling, he was infected with syphilis at an early age, he squandered his inheritance. He found the process of writing agonisingly difficult. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>To the reader,</em> he addresses us directly: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">— Hypocrite lecteur, — mon semblable, — mon frère!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which is to say, in effect: you my reader are a hypocrite, you are like me, you are my brother! </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In calling us hypocrites, he’s not being insulting. He’s acknowledging that we often pretend &#8211; specifically, we pretend to be happier than we really are. He won’t be telling us that everything is going to be fine but he offers us his companionship, because he knows our troubles (and more) from the inside. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Advertisers think they have to tell something cheerful &#8211; rather than, as is the truth, confirm the legitimacy of their true, sorrowful feelings. They’re forgetting to address us as mature people: individuals who can, with a little help, accept complexity and compromise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea isn’t that advertising &#8211; or selling more broadly &#8211; should undertake a volte face and always be melancholy. What we’re suggesting is that it could very usefully extend its emotional range. It could <em>sometimes</em> meet us in other moods.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9038266281_73834f2696_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7282" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/9038266281_73834f2696_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="9038266281_73834f2696_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This has big implications, because there are needs we’re more alive to when we feel a bit sad. We don’t stop being consumers when we’re down; but we have different priorities. One could project a financial services company that routinely demonstrated that it was in touch with our sorrows; or a gaming company that could pick up our interest in our melancholy times. There is a market for more modest, more down-beat products. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of a firm wanting to hire the best new recruits. The natural temptation is to be very cheery about working for the firm &#8211; everything is sunny, the work is fascinating, the team is shoulder-to-shoulder. But many of the most talented, resourceful and loyal potential staff will be complicated individuals. They’re less robotic, more realistic about themselves. To draw them to your firm, an admission of life’s sorrows (including the sorrows of work: ‘sometimes its disappointing and there are days when we all wonder if it’s really all worth it’) could be a crucial advantage. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Inauthenticity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Salesmanship goes wrong when the seller comes across as inauthentic. They seem not quite a real person: too smooth, too slick or over-friendly (but not actually a friend). Their efforts to appeal &#8211; and to win the trust of the customer &#8211; backfire. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The product itself might actually be pretty good in many ways. It’s the effort to sell it that’s going wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4700653868_375c9f633e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7284" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4700653868_375c9f633e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="4700653868_375c9f633e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inauthenticity stems from mistaken assumptions about what other people want and what they are like. The seller moulds themselves to what they erroneously imagine the customer wants them to be. They adopt an attitude they don’t personally like in the hope of pleasing the client. It’s a wrong theory of what you would need to do to win other people over. And it tends not to work terribly well, because we’re all amazingly astute detectors of fake emotions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– The management of a resort hotel might think: we should pretend to be servile to the clients &#8211; presumably that’s what <em>they</em> want even though we don’t like it when people do that to us. With the result that a family never goes back to a particular hotel on an island they love. They complain to their friends that the staff seemed plastic and a bit creepy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– An aspiring novelist feels: I’d best lace the story with references to luxury products and Bond-type violence, even though I personally find that a turn off, because that’s what sells isn’t it? The publishers turns down an otherwise promising manuscript. In the commissioning meeting, the book is rejected because it was felt to lack conviction.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A stockbroker wants to build up the relationship with a significant client and takes them out to lunch, thinking: I’ll chummy them along with talk (that bores me to tears) of golf courses and school fees. The result is the broker appears false and untrustworthy, and the firm loses the account, despite the fact that the results last year were pretty good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A high-flying professor of economics is co-opted by a major political party to help sell their economic policies to the electorate. They clown around in an interview on Sunrise and come across as condescending. Some important ideas about the nation’s finances lose credibility and get put on the back-burner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A woman fears that her partner won’t stay with her unless she pretends to be more outdoorsy than she really is. She psyches herself up to seem enthusiastic about a camping trip. Eventually her misery become obvious and the relationship falls apart. Or, worse, she hates it but puts on a brave face. She ends up dreading every holiday for the next ten years and it ends in a bruising divorce.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– A company wants to improve the calibre of recruits it</span> takes on, in view of a big expansion into new markets. They’re offering a competitive salary but feel they need to woo the very best candidates with an airbrushed vision of the firm’s character: it’s dynamic, thrilling, everyone’s great friends. Though they themselves know it’s not perfect but accept it for what it is: intermittently interesting, occasionally frustrating, riddled with normal workplace tensions &#8211; that is: much like other places. The interviewees they are most impressed by get the sense there’s something not quite right and turn down the job offers.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person, service, product or employer on offer may have some real merits. But the selling fails because it’s not authentic. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a very natural worry that leads one to this: in my heart of hearts I think that what I’ve got to offer is pretty good, if I were them I’d take it. But I fear that if I tell it like it is, they’ll reject it and me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inauthenticity is rooted in lack of confidence: specifically a lack of confidence in your own responses and desires and intuitions and an assumption that other people are very different from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3255644630_4052a81d9c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7293" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3255644630_4052a81d9c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3255644630_4052a81d9c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our best source for understanding what people are going to like or cope with is, in fact, ourselves. How you like to be treated, what you enjoy eating or reading, what you accept as OK gives very good guidance to how other people are likely to respond. (Of course it’s not a 100% guarantee that everyone will share your response. But that’s never what’s needed. No company on earth can get &#8211; or realistically seek &#8211; every customer in a competitive market.) Weirdly, though, we tend not to take this information seriously. We don’t recognise its importance. We don’t let it govern our salesmanship. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>authentic</em> selling the seller trusts their own personal responses. They build on the idea that the Other is likely to be quite a lot like them. They come across as charming. You feel that someone is charming, not just because they’re being polite but for a bigger reason. You feel they’re intuitively in touch with your needs. For instance, they might quickly pick up on when you feel slightly awkward and deftly move to reassure you &#8211; even if it’s only with a sympathetic smile. What they’re doing in fact is using their own experience of feeling ill at ease to tune into what’s going on for you. They’re doing you the courtesy of thinking that since they’d feel awkward in your shoes, you’re probably feeling awkward too (though you’ve not explicitly let on). An air steward becomes charmless if (for example) they ignore their own experience of being occasionally baffled by technology and give you the impression they think you’re a bit of an idiot because you’re having trouble operating the entertainment system. They are assuming that they are not like you and opening up a gap which charm works to close.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm is a common factor in lots of good selling situations: good writing, a good lunch companion, good public speaking or producing good copy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 16th-century French philosopher Michel de Montaigne has a couple of things to teach us about charm. He took the classically leaden and chilly philosophical essay and delighted his contemporaries (and subsequent readers down the centuries) by transforming it into something engaging. He’s got serious things to say but he says them in a charming way. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He acknowledges the fears of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s natural to get a bit anxious around intellectual matters; one is going to lose the thread, get bored or feel humiliated. Sometimes Montaigne is upfront about this. He’ll say, this is getting too complicated or this is starting to be tedious. But he acknowledges it in other ways too. He keep his chapters short.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He uses lots of concrete examples. He adds in jokes. He mocks people who are intellectually arrogant. All of these signal that he’s attuned to the secret worries we might have. He didn’t work this out by consulting a focus group. He knows we have these fears because he’s noticed them in himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He’s authentic &#8211; and charming &#8211; because he’s working from the belief that we’re pretty much like him and so he can trust his own feelings in our company.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Michel_de_Montaigne_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7298" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Michel_de_Montaigne_1-1.jpg?resize=690%2C358" alt="Michel_de_Montaigne_1 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He reveals things about himself that go beyond the so-called polite</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne is an unusual author because he’s ready to let down his guard and tell us things about himself that people tend to feel a bit ashamed of and to keep quiet about for fear of losing the good opinion of others. He recounts his bouts of impotence. He admits he farts quite a lot and that he has trouble with his bowel movements. He’s not <em>only</em> parading his vulnerabilities. He’s doing it because he knows it’s a way to get us to feel relaxed in his company. He’s demonstrating he’s like us &#8211; even though <em>unlike</em> us he knows a lot about Greek literature and the secret goings on of the diplomatic world. We’ll go with him on his travels through the world of ideas because he’s won our confidence with his candour. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Montaigne is showing us that the way to get good results is to acknowledge fears and frailties. In another context, it’s the way a great general gets the best out of his troops because he’s always showing that he knows what it feels like to be on the front line. It’s the senior manager who can good-humouredly fix a paper jam in the copying machine, and the teacher who is powerfully alive to what it’s like to be nine. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm is a graceful acknowledgement of our reality. The failure to make this acknowledgement &#8211; the shortfall in charm &#8211; explains what can go wrong in:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The half-empty stiff, posh restaurant</em>. The management hasn’t clearly enough identified what they themselves enjoy about elegance. So they’ve ended up creating a slightly pompous, frosty atmosphere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>An uninteresting novel</em>. The writer has read a lot of the big famous works. When Dickens takes a character into a house, he always gives an elaborate description. He doesn’t just say, &#8216;They went to Jim’s place.’ He says something like: ‘James O’Donnell (after his late and occasionally lamented mother) Merriweather &#8211; Jim to his confreres &#8211; was the fortunate denizen of a delicious set of rooms perched in the higher regions of one of the more recently constructed communal mansions of that portion of our capital officially designated as Battersea.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Boring social evenings</em>. The conversation never quite takes off and people are cagey with each other. The hosts haven’t been able to home in on what they themselves are actually like &#8211; what they actually liked about the best parties they’ve been to. Probably they’ve picked up on incidentals. They went to a delightful dinner where (as it happened) they were serving Japanese food. When entertaining, they focus a lot of attention on the sushi. But though the fish was great, that wasn’t actually what made the evening they recall so special. It was actually the way the hostess introduced people to one another, the way the host unobtrusively steered the conversation into very interesting waters &#8211; these were the active ingredients. And our couple enjoyed them, but without quite realising it. And in giving their own parties, they don’t focus on the things that really make an evening work.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard for us to hold on to our common humanity. And it means that our efforts to sell (ideas, social companionship, tables in a restaurant) to other people get derailed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a typical sales strategy that tries to avoid acknowledgement of potential problems. It’s an instinctive move, built on an an underlying theory: if you mention the problem, it gets worse. But in selling, it’s a liability. Because the problem is going to emerge at some point. You’ll lose future sales, have disgruntled customers on your hands and discover there’s a popular Facebook page for people who feel they’ve been let down by you and want the world to know all about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm has a very distinctive attitude to problems. The charming person sees a problem as a potential bond &#8211; a shared difficulty. We pick up on it socially. They’re in the car with you and you struggle to get into a parking space (though it’s not really that small): they don’t look down on you. In a minute they’re telling you how they’re nervous of roundabouts and steep hills. The little indignities of driving become a private joke between you. Charm has a good attitude to mentioning problems, founded on the charming person’s readiness to see problems as a normal and interesting part of life. They know everything has its downsides. A problem isn’t fatal. So there’s more confidence in being upfront about defects.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charm sells not because it is (as its detractors suggest) sleek and ingratiating. No one finds that charming. But because it grows out of self-knowledge and confidence in shared humanity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. Bad Teaching</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling is often an attempt to teach the merits of a product or service (or of oneself) to another. So selling gets into trouble &#8211; that is, it gets less effective &#8211; when the seller is a bad teacher. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What actually makes someone a poor teacher? No one is deliberately setting out to fail to teach. But bad teaching is not inevitable. There’s a central error the ineffective teachers make. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The bad teacher has forgotten the fears of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can take a look at this happening in higher education. Philosophy departments typically want to get more students to attend courses. They want to grow their numbers. So they advertise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here’s an advertisement for philosophy from Birkbeck College, which offers courses in central London in the evenings for adult learners &#8211; anyone can enrol. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Birkbeck1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7200" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Birkbeck1.png?resize=528%2C172" alt="Birkbeck" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The advert is written by people who know a lot about philosophy. They’re adept at constructing sophisticated theories. But they’re less good at handling some widespread fears around intellectual life. It could be boring. The class could be filled with awkward people. It could all be baffling. The promotional page doesn’t tune into the worries. It inadvertently enhances them. We’re now queasy at the thought of trying to identify ‘the nature of reality’ or daunted by the prospect of ‘dealing with fundamental questions in a rigorous way’ (one may end up dealing with them in a sloppy way and get humiliated). The bad teacher is impatient with the fears we have. They blame us for having them. Which does nothing to bring people in or help anyone to learn. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are lots of areas which fail to appreciate widespread fears and reluctance in the modern economy: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-548855307.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7201" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-548855307.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="woman using dental floss to clean her teeth" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Flossing products tend to stress the positives: look at how lovely your teeth will be when you’ve been flossing regularly for a long time. You could be like her. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve neglected a set of anxieties that in fact get in the way of more people buying their product and getting on with the job. One feels: I’ll get bored, it’s depressing looking at my very imperfect teeth in the bathroom mirror; it’s too fiddly. We don’t take pride in these negative feelings, but we have them. The advert aggravates them by showing us someone who seems to be great because they are entirely free of our troubles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They could develop some adverts using people with these fears: a spotty teenager looking blearily into the mirror and swearing every time the floss slips and cursing the red marks on their thumb where the thread has been pulled too tight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or there’s the macho sportswear manufacturer who has forgotten the fears people have around sport. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adidas-Wariner1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7202" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Adidas-Wariner1.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="Adidas-Wariner1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>They</em> love rugged athleticism, they’re keen on pushing themselves; they enjoy the banter of the locker room. But most people aren’t like this. Mostly we’re pretty anxious around sport. We don’t win. We’re not very fit and we’re intimidated by those who excel. So the advert ends up sending us the message that the product (and the whole area of life it is related to) isn’t for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad teaching is a commercial problem for the seller: they aren’t reaching a segment of their potential market. But it’s also a loss for us &#8211; the consumers whose fears are ignored and cast as embarrassing. Because what these companies are selling isn’t just floss or running shoes. It’s healthy gums and confident enjoyment of exercise. And these are things we need in our lives. They’re making it harder for us to live well because they increase our anxieties (or at least don’t calm them down) around things that would actually be good for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The good teacher is onto the fears and resistance of the audience</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we’ve seen, any product or service has around it fears that are holding back growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fears could include the worry that something is: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too intellectual:<em> I can’t purchase that book, see myself reading that newspaper</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too rugged: <em>I can’t buy a tent</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too technical: <em>I can’t have that coffee machine in my life</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too feminist:<em> I can’t watch this comedy show</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too sexist: <em>I can’t buy this car</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too Brazilian: <em>I can’t join that dancing class, work for that firm</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– too American: <em>I can’t go to that restaurant chain</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good teachers (and sellers) don’t say: you shouldn’t have this fear. They don’t send out signals that only inadequate people have worries like these. They don’t stay quiet about them. Instead, they take them by the horns. They acknowledge where people are starting from and work from there. They don’t feel that acknowledging a fear is the same as endorsing it. They believe that acknowledging a fear is a key moment in a process of overcoming it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Sir Humphry Davy</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(1778 – 1829) was one of the great scientists of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7203" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="Sir_Humphry_Davy,_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Admired by his scientific peers for proving that oxymuriatic acid does not contain oxygen</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was a very serious man. He was a pioneer of electrolysis. He helped discover the elements barium and boron. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Davy was also very ambitious for the contribution science could make to our lives (he invented a special lamp for miners to use underground)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and he wanted to see a society where scientific understanding was widespread, not reserved for a few specialists. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He became very popular for the talks he gave around the UK. He was brilliant at drawing people in. In his public lectures lectures, he always had lots of explosions, smells and clouds of steam &#8211; he loved making jokes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7204" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He realised that a key fear of the audience is: it will be too serious. He didn’t feel that science is so important and serious, it is above fun. He realised that it has to be fun if a lot of people are going to engage with it. He didn’t look down on people because they were nervous around complicated things. He realised he could make some moves that would disarm these anxieties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Jamie Oliver</em> realises that for a lot of men there’s a fear around cooking certain things: it will be too feminine. There’s a powerful subterranean worry that you can’t be a proper man and cook asparagus and mint risotto. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lrg_3569.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7205" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lrg_3569.jpg?resize=635%2C288" alt="lrg_3569" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Jamie Oliver</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Oliver never gives the impression that it’s stupid or low to have this anxiety. He makes a great play of being blokey and doing some things which social tradition has made feel unavailable to key groups of people. He’s turned addressing this fear into a career. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What distinguishes these great teachers is the way they view the fears of the audience. They don’t get angry or annoyed. They don’t blame people. They are unthreatened by the fact that someone has some worries. Because they don’t see a fear as the end of the story. They know that fears &#8211; if treated nicely &#8211; can be disarmed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. Badgering </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling goes wrong when it pesters people. And unfortunately, a lot of selling and advertising is annoying. It turns up at awkward times and in places where it’s not wanted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/8122329406_1499a8d7d3_m.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7206" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/8122329406_1499a8d7d3_m.jpg?resize=440%2C440" alt="8122329406_1499a8d7d3_m" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You get out of the shower to answer the doorbell &#8211; it’s people selling an animal charity. Or, your computer is bunged up with pop-ups. Every day you encounter thousands of promotions for products you don’t need and will never buy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem isn’t with the products. The burgers could be fine, the charity is deserving, the agents might work round the clock in the interests of their clients. The things you don’t need might be exactly what another person requires. The problem isn’t selling as such. It’s trying to sell to the wrong person at the wrong time. Badgering has two characteristics: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Randomness</em>: they’re assaulting the whole world because they’re not sure how to reach their real audience </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Untimeliness</em>: they’ve not managed to get you at the point when you’re receptive</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7308" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3464701573_cfa85d01fb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a version of badgering in relationships: <em>nagging</em>. The aim might be really very reasonable &#8211; this person should take out the rubbish or clean their room. But the approach isn’t helpful: repetition of the demand at inopportune moments and lack of insight into how to motivate this person to do what you want. Nagging is sadly liable to make compliance less likely. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In love, badgering gives us the stalker. It’s the person who knows they are keen on someone but has no view of why the other should be interested in them. They have no seductive resources and simply impose themselves in a deeply unpleasant manner. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering is commercially counterproductive. It’s a poor selling strategy because the annoying methods turn many potential customers off the products. It might get you a little bit of acquiescence, but you lose goodwill. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Why sellers end up badgering </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a few reasons companies end up badgering the public: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The age of the internet</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By reducing the cost of getting at people, technology encourages randomness: you can bother tons of people, even if you only end up getting one or two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5224107005_822633d4db_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7310" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5224107005_822633d4db_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5224107005_822633d4db_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Tom Hickmore</h6>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Lack of empathy with the customer</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering grows from an unflattering &#8211; and mistaken &#8211; picture of the customer. It supposes </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the customer can only respond to loud noises</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- can be won over by sheer repetition</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- will readily respond to vulgar signals…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t how the sellers themselves feel and behave. They don’t like being pestered. But they don’t think of their audience as being basically quite like them in this respect. They lose touch with their own experience when devising their selling strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4523440002_4e37d583f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7312" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/4523440002_4e37d583f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="4523440002_4e37d583f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Minimal customer information</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an approach that suggests the seller doesn’t know the customer’s needs and aren’t very interested in finding out more: if you knew anything about me, you wouldn’t be trying to reach me this way. Maybe I could be persuaded &#8211; just not the way you’re going about it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Low self-esteem around the product</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Giving the impression that you are trying to force a desire (and a product) on the customer &#8211; suggests you don’t really feel that you have anything genuine to offer. It suggests that the seller doesn’t quite believe that the product would, on its own merits, be wanted.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Currently a lot of people have to be bothered so that a few people can be pleased. Or you are targeting the right person, but at the wrong moment. How do we get from where we are to the utopia, where we&#8217;re addressing the right person at the right time?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Growing out of Nagging</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Badgering people, and nagging, are natural strategies for gaining attention. We used them as babies, when we had no other options. A baby’s wail makes the carer respond, even if they don’t want to &#8211; just to get some peace and quiet. The six-year-old has no capacity to rationally persuade his parents to buy him a goldfish but will instinctively assume that asking a million times will work (and occasionally it does).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>This is where we all have come from. We carry a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lot of residue. And when we’re under pressure when stressed, we return to these early instincts.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path of growth towards adulthood involves getting better at three things: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Greater awareness of who you are talking to and their needs</em>. The badgering child doesn’t really understand why the parent won’t agree. The child thinks: maybe they’ve forgotten (in the last three minutes) so I’ll ask again. Good growth here means getting more aware of what the parent’s reservations might actually be. The art of persuasion evolves via working out how to address the worries. So at fourteen, the child might be drawing up a little document called: why I should be allowed to go on the school trip to Berlin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry one: it would be too expensive. But you wouldn’t have to feed me for three weeks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry two: I didn’t get a good grade in German last term. But that’s because I don’t see the point of learning a language I don’t need to use. Going to Berlin would change that. It would motivate me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Worry three: You think I’ll get homesick. Remember I was fine when I stayed with granny for a week when you went to Atlanta. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Getting more sensitive to the context</em>. The child might learn that their aunt’s rather luxurious flat is not a good place to ask their parents for anything, because that place tends to make them feel anxious about money.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Timeliness</em>. They know that their mother is very likely to listen carefully at 3.00pm on Sunday, and not at all at 7.45 am on Monday. Or that the drive home from school is the ideal time to make a big request.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more I can allow myself to find out about the customer, the less I’m inclined to badger or nag. This means getting a more accurate, insightful picture of their concerns and needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The ideal of commerce is that it is delivering on the needs a person truly has &#8211; even on ones they don’t at first fully recognise they have. It might be actually a great contribution to someone’s life to take a trip to the Colorado desert; or make a career shift or buy a ten-seater dining table (though at yet such needs haven’t crystallised in their mind). A friend might see these things. The friend could recognise the need on the basis of understanding the person’s life. That doesn’t mean tracking that they’ve just purchased some toothpaste or that they&#8217;ve watched six episodes of <em>House of Cards</em> on Netflix last week. Rather, the friend can see what’s happening in this individual’s life: how they are getting sucked into preoccupation with status (hence the merits of the desert &#8211; where status doesn’t count); or there’s a level of cynicism about work building up, that’s probably connected to the industry they are working in; or they could do with improving relations with their extended family &#8211; but on their own terms. Getting them a big table regularly &#8211; like their parents used to do &#8211; would be a great help.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get to this level of insight would require building up a huge amount of trust between the seller and the potential customer. At the moment, selling is fragmented. You buy different things from different people. You might trust them in one area (they are excellent at supplying children’s T-shirts, or a reliable place to book flights) but it doesn’t extend to offering these suppliers a portrait of you as a person. Yet in principle, there’s a huge benefit for the customer. The supplier acts as their friend, in their best interests, grounded in real understanding of their best interests and needs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Sensitivity to the context</em>. A hamburger doesn’t go well with a ploughed field. Everyone’s slightly aware that a hamburger might not be the most natural thing in the world. And you might not want to advertise a luxury handbag anywhere near a bank. Context foregrounds certain aspects of your mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Timeliness</em>. This means understanding when a person is in the right mood to be receptive to the sales pitch. It’s not exploitation. It’s realising that there are times when we’re more alive to important truths and grasping that at other times we may be very annoyed if we’re addressed on certain matters. (Everyone recognises this in their own life).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2687999331_209904f9f1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7332" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2687999331_209904f9f1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C468" alt="2687999331_209904f9f1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might genuinely be wise for an individual to sign up for an exercise program or have a body scan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But quite probably, they are very resistant to thinking about these things. There might just be a few times in a year when they are able to look squarely at this genuine need. Getting them at such a point (with a sincere and decent offer) means engaging with their own better, but often hidden, nature. You are doing them a huge service if you can discover a good moment at which to raise a tricky topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves all build on the same underlying point: a higher quality of relationship between the seller and the potential buyer than is currently familiar. Badgering is the polar opposite. Trust arises when the seller is seeking to make a profit only from making a valuable contribution to the customer’s life. We could imagine a commercial utopia in which this was standard practice. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. Fear of Success</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling can go wrong for many people because they are afraid of success. To sell would be to succeed and this makes them anxious. So they end up avoiding selling or bungling the opportunities. It’s a problem that can sound unlikely. Because we sometimes assume that everyone is keen to succeed. Being afraid of succeeding sounds strange. But it happens quite a lot: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been asked to make a presentation to a large and important audience. You feel terrified. You can’t sleep and try to think of ways of getting out of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>You fantasise about coming down with the flu the day before. In the end you have to do it. The presentation is a bit leaden. You get tongue-tied and confused when a key potential client asks a question.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7072298139_22f4d43fd6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7333" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/7072298139_22f4d43fd6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="7072298139_22f4d43fd6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An external contractor on a major project keeps pushing things in a direction you think isn’t quite right. But you find it very difficult to rein them in. It’s going over-budget, it’s not really what your firm needs. But you find it very hard to insist. The contractor is the specialist, they’ve got a lot of prestige in the industry. You don’t sell your ideas. You back down, even though you know you are right. It’s a nightmare. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling ‘you shouldn’t put your head above the parapet, it’s asking for trouble’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Causes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear of success is a problem. But it is an understandable one: there are three reasons why it can end up looking dangerous to succeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Fear of competition</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I am not competing with the alphas &#8211; so they won’t see me as a target worth attacking&#8230;’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I keep a low profile, they’ll ignore me, I’ll be safe. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">A worry about provoking envy</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s always a lot of envy circulating in the world. But being envied is (close up) a very unpleasant experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s not like admiration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, to ward this off, one keeps one’s light under a bushel (one has come, unfortunately, to confuse success with boasting, arrogance, being smug.) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Performance anxiety</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I say I can do something and then it turns out I can’t, the women in the hall will laugh, I’ll get mocked in the pub. The consequences of trying and failing seem so risky, that on balance it feels prudent not to try at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fixes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Dignifying the problem</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fear of success is a problem that can afflict capable people &#8211; and those you’d maybe least expect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-544748195.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7225" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/GettyImages-544748195.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="General Eisenhower And Harold Macmillan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Harold Macmillan, the British Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963, was deeply affected by fear of success. He looked sure of himself; he could come across as smug. But he was terrified that his mentors &#8211; Winston Churchill and Anthony Eden &#8211; would see him as a threat and either abandon or humiliate him. He was always physically sick before making a speech in the House of Commons. In 1945 he had the support of a majority of Conservative MPs to run for leadership of the party. But he held back because it would have meant confronting those two men. It was twelve years before he finally took over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The French painter Henri Matisse eventually became loved around the world for his free, joyful style.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Matissedance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7209" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/640px-Matissedance.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="640px-Matissedance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he didn’t start out working like that. For years he was gripped by fear of success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/not-identified.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7210" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/not-identified.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="not-identified" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He worked in a deeply conventional way that gave no hint of his own character or preferences. He was inhibited by the anxiety that if he succeeded &#8211; if he produced the work he really wanted to &#8211; he would be criticised, especially by his own father who was a dour disciplinarian. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Examples like this remind us that fear of success is an honourable problem. They reduce panic and make it easier to admit one has this issue &#8211; which is a key step in addressing it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Understanding where the fear has come from</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fear of success may have been acquired in unfortunate past environments where success really could be dangerous. You may have been in a school where people actually could get attacked by their classmates for doing too well in a test. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might have grown up around an older brother who would react very aggressively if you ever seemed to be better at anything than him. If it looked like you might win at Monopoly, he’d kick the board over. If you were running faster than him, he’d trip you up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/307133988_fe3ef3c32d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7335" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/307133988_fe3ef3c32d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="307133988_fe3ef3c32d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An insecure father might endlessly tell stories of back-stabbing, betrayal, of how good people &#8211; like him &#8211; always get done over by the bad guys. At a young age this picture of the world (in which success is equated with scurrility) that gets lodged deep in your brain. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fear was learned in particular past contexts; but the mind hasn’t quite caught up that in fact that your situation has changed; it’s following an old, tenacious pattern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding where the fear has started allows one to see that it doesn’t apply anymore. It may take many reminders of this to start to shift the pattern of thinking and feeling and make it more appropriate to where one is today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Looking very carefully at the imagined danger</em>: making oneself get serious and logical about the fear. What exactly do I think would happen if the presentation went well, if I insisted on my idea, if I sold a huge project to this client? One tries to visualise it in detail. Who does one fear would actually get upset. What might they do and say? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then each element is carefully unpacked. What evidence do I actually have that people would react like that? don’t just ask the question. Write down a detailed answer. Use specific names, dates, describe the circumstances. Would Xavier actually feel slighted. How do I know this? If he did feel slighted, what problems would this actually bring? Could he block my career? If he wanted to sabotage the project, could he actually accomplish that? Could he reduce my salary package? If he tried who could I turn to? If the presentation went well, how would Paul, Fleur and Cassie actually react? Did they react badly when Tammy gave that excellent presentation on the Singapore market? Why would it be different for me? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">11. Resistance to Learning</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Selling can go wrong, because the seller is resistant to learning. We tend not to notice we have this problem, because we assume we like learning. We do. But the issue is about the kinds of things we might need to learn and our attitude to learning those particular things. We tend to have quite a restricted idea of <em>what is learnable</em>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7211" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/images.jpg?resize=182%2C277" alt="images" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dale Carnegie’s 1936 bestseller <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em> can easily provoke a negative reaction. One builds up a picture of someone cynically pretending to be friendly (when really they are not your friend at all). And of setting out to take advantage of you by following a few dark rules of the art of manipulating people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We resist the notion that being warm, kind or charming are things that can be taught or learned. We’ve fallen prey to a Romantic belief that if it’s good, it can’t be learned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">William Wordsworth &#8211; the leading figure of the Romantic Movement in England &#8211; defined poetry as ‘the spontaneous overflow of of powerful emotion.’ He was setting up an ideal that wasn’t meant to be confined to people writing sonnets. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/William_Wordsworth_0011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7213" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/William_Wordsworth_0011.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="NPG 1857,William Wordsworth,by Benjamin Robert Haydon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was promoting a general idea about how we should live. We should honour instinct and give the prestige to everything natural. Following rules and hiding your feelings were looked on with horror. It was an attitude deeply opposed to deliberately working out how to get someone to like you or studying how to influence. Wordsworth was a pioneer with his outlook, but he eventually had huge influence. And today<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it feels unfamiliar &#8211; and a bit sinister &#8211; to suggest that anything very personal could be learned. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fixes </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aristocratic culture used to pay great attention to learning a wide range of things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7214" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FdeTroyLectureMoliere.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="FdeTroyLectureMoliere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One might profitably learn how to stand behind a chair, how to have a conversation, how to hold a book, how loud to laugh, how to be witty, how to flirt and how to say no without giving offence. They took the view that our natural instincts could be improved by training and education. We may not need to learn precisely those things. It’s the more general attitude that matters: lots of little things can be learned and if you learn them it makes you nicer for other people to be around. It helps you succeed in the world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their view of what you might need to learn &#8211; can seem strange to us. But they were actually just continuing the long-running classical approach to education. That’s the view that the task of education is to improve nature. It takes as a starting point that we are not by nature well equipped to do all the things we need to. The classic approach took inspiration from tools and implements and all the technology they knew. They were particularly impressed by pulleys. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engravings-from-albertis-ten-books-of-architecture-2-large1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7216" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/engravings-from-albertis-ten-books-of-architecture-2-large1.jpg?resize=608%2C550" alt="engravings-from-albertis-ten-books-of-architecture-2-large" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No individual is fitted by nature to lift a heavy statue. But with a neat artifice it becomes easily doable. Likewise, they reasoned, by nature we were not usually very adept at forming friendships, or explaining ourselves, or meeting strangers or telling anecdotes, or getting people to agree with us. We require artifice to rise to the challenge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Learning how to do something doesn’t make us insincere. It just makes us better at doing it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION: The dawn of capitalism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Driving in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>taxi through Times Square at night, one might be mesmerised by the power of selling. A vast quantity of effort and ambition has been focused here. The entire square and (it feels) the sky is glowing with an urgent longing to entice us into buying a watch or a hamburger. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1_times_square_night_2013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7217" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/1_times_square_night_2013.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="1_times_square_night_2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But not everyone is impressed. There might be a visitor from Europe who gets a bit annoyed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>by place. The sight of all these luminous adverts irritates them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re not alone. They’re expressing a widespread attitude. Commerce, advertising and selling may be an unavoidable part of life, but it’s a low part. And the bigger and more powerful it gets (and in Times Square it seems very powerful indeed) the more it drags a whole society down: how can I be an honourable person in a society like this? This visitor can get very gloomy. They think wistfully of Chartres Cathedral, which they fondly remember visiting a few years ago. It’s also famous for light and colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7218" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière.jpeg?resize=635%2C582" alt="Chartres_-_cathédrale_-_ND_de_la_belle_verrière" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They complain that Times Square is just commercial: it’s all about selling stuff. They see it as a sign of the failure of the modern world: in the past people built noble temples, here everything is business. It’s disgusting. Selling, they feel, is the root of the problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this can’t be right. Because Chartres Cathedral was, in fact, a huge, highly elaborate, machine for selling. Amongst its more prominent advertising spaces are the round windows (which have been described as a crowning glory of French Culture).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Leo-July-Sept07-DE7906sAR800.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7219" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Leo-July-Sept07-DE7906sAR800.jpg?resize=635%2C472" alt="Leo-July-Sept07-DE7906sAR800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>An advert for the dignity of manual labour:</strong> threshing the corn can be boring, but Chartres is selling a consoling and accurate idea of it’s honourable place in the life of the community (which one is otherwise liable to lose sight of). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7220" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="800px-Chartres_-_Rose_du_transept_Nord_-3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An advert for maternal kindness</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chartres was selling too: just at a more ambitious level. The Catholic Church was a corporation trading in ideas and experiences concerning forgiveness, love, duty, admitting one’s faults, being listened to and having one’s hidden merits appreciated. The Church wasn’t doing this simply in order to make money &#8211; these were its foundational convictions. But it was rewarded financially on a grand scale for supplying them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference between Times Square and Chartres Cathedral isn’t to do with selling in itself. Both are devoted to selling. The difference is to do with WHAT is being advertised and sold. Times Square is selling chocolate, beer, cars, hamburgers and soft drinks. While Chartres Cathedral has a more elevated set of goods and services on offer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re still at the dawn of capitalism. We can imagine Times Square in the future selling the important things: cures for loneliness, aids to forgiveness, things that help us be wise and kind. We don’t have to stop being devoted to advertising and commerce: we just need to engage with our higher needs and learn to profit from them. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When companies think about innovating new products and services (or just testing their existing ones), they know that the task before them is to find out what their customers are really looking for.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How do you discover this? Generally, companies do one very plausible, but in fact very problematic thing. They go and ask the customer. However, strangely, if you really want to know what your customer wants, the last thing you should do is to go out and ask them. And for a simple reason: they won’t know.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4071171742_e69ed989ae_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7109" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4071171742_e69ed989ae_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4071171742_e69ed989ae_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Companies have traditionally followed the methods of the social sciences and gone in for</span> large data samples and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire on the one hand and the focus group on the other have been mainstays of company research programmes for many decades. But these approaches have a crucial limitation built into them. They assume that other people already know pretty well what it is they are looking for &#8211; and the only thing one needs to do is ask them, collect the data, and move forward. However, the big and rather strange truth is that your customers don’t really know what they want. They can’t give you &#8211; ready made &#8211; the answers you seek.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The phenomenon becomes more obvious when you consider the case of art. It would be very odd indeed if an artist were to use a focus group to arrive at an answer to the question of what to paint or write next. We sense that this would be asking too much of the audience. How could they know that what they really wanted was <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> or a tender romantic comedy about two people meeting on an Austrian train (<em>Before Midnight</em>)? W</span>e wouldn’t have been able to say what the gap in our lives was until a given artist filled it in. Hence the apparent ‘creative’ magic of the artist: they know us, but better than we know ourselves.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or, to return to business, no one could have invented the Post-it note simply on the basis of a survey of what most customers walking into stationery shops were after. It’s only once we see certain products that we realise that, in fact, in a vague inarticulate way, we wanted them all along. We have the needs, but we can’t pin them down. A central task of creative thinking is therefore to be the detector and interpreter of the unspoken and &#8211; up to that point &#8211; hidden needs of mankind. Surveys &#8211; for all their other merits &#8211; can never do this, for the big reason that we just don’t know our needs well enough. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So the real secret to understanding customer-needs lies elsewhere; in using the tools of <em>Introspection</em> and <em>Empathy</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">a) Introspection</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introspection means using oneself as the central instrument of detection, focused on one’s sources of private joy and unhappiness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need some very fine-grained data that hasn’t made it into public language, and therefore won’t be picked up by surveys; data that has the quality of artistic insights, though it won’t be used for art. Businesses of the future are built up on tremors of inner thrill and distress &#8211; tremors that haven’t made it into language, that aren’t in circulation, but that if one attends to them, can lead to amazingly true and lucrative things.</span></p>
<p class="p2">This is how the in-car cup holder was &#8211; at last &#8211; invented.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01922/Cup-holder_1922913c.jpg?resize=460%2C287" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">One of the key things you need to do in a car is to have a place to put a drink. But for most of the history of car production, a drink for the driver was a hard thought for a car company to have or for customers to express, though, of course, people were always balancing drinks on their knees or wedging styrofoam cups into little clefts between bags (and praying they wouldn’t have to do an emergency stop). But the productive idea that there could just be a little thing connected to the dashboard that would solve this problem didn’t emerge until 1983, with the launch of the Dodge Caravan. Recognition of the need for a cup holder was inhibited. There was huge emphasis on the <em>driving</em> experience &#8211; that is on all the things <em>essential</em> to driving: the angle of the seat, feel of the grip of the steering wheel, the ease with which one could view the speedometer while turning a corner… all these received minute, careful attention. But the incidental concern (from the point of view of actually driving, that is) of taking a sip of orange juice at the traffic lights languished until 1983.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The American writer Emerson once wrote: ‘In the minds of geniuses we find, once more, our own neglected thoughts.’ Likewise, in the minds of car-design geniuses,  our own neglected thoughts and needs are identified &#8211; and acted upon. And hundreds of millions of journeys are made a little bit nicer.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now that the cereal bar exists, we can see that it fits in with many needs: it’s quite healthy, it’s convenient, it’s tasty and it’s inexpensive to produce. But, though it now seems an obvious kind of product, the cereal bar was very slow to arrive on the market. There had been many kinds of sweet bars and many kinds of cereal for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7094" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5574813879_98f3741212_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5574813879_98f3741212_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The root of the problem is that the cereal bar is essentially just a few bits of dry cereal. And originally cereal wasn’t intended to be eaten dry. But the fact is, eating dry cereal is rather nice. Many many people must have had this experience, without taking it seriously. They’d scoop a handful of cornflakes while someone else was pouring the milk and munch away happily. They didn’t realise that they were having an experience which &#8211; if commercialised &#8211; could found a large industry and send lorries around the country delivering repacked dry cereal to tens of thousands of retail outlets. Great ideas don’t always feel like brilliant insights. They (unfortunately) can easily feel like completely humdrum, low-status, trivial thoughts. The fear of being boring or weird continues to quash an enormous number of good ideas. </span></p>
<p class="p2">This only changed in 1975, when an inventor called Stanley Mason (also responsible for the squeezable ketchup bottle and for the dental floss dispenser) came up with the idea of granola bar. In 2015, in the US alone, the cereal bar market was worth $5 billion.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/media2.onsugar.com/files/2013/04/16/1/192/1922195/9933e12f6488395a_Crunchy-Granola-Bars.jpg?resize=301%2C414" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">In the minds of geniuses, we rediscover our own neglected thoughts (Emerson)</span></h5>
<p class="p2">The difference between the creative and the uncreative mind &#8211; Emerson was saying &#8211; isn’t that the creative person has <em>different</em> thoughts. Both have roughly the same ones. It’s just that the creative mind takes them seriously, while the uncreative one discards them. What enables them to do this is a quality very dear to Emerson, independence, a freedom from group thinking: a capacity to be thought odd by many for a time in order to hold onto one’s own desires.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Edward Hopper certainly wasn’t the first person to feel the lonely charm of the railway station or the strangely comforting anonymity of the late-night diner or the eeriness of Sunday in the suburbs. People had been primed to dislike or ignore these situations, so they didn’t give weight to such low-status moments. But Hopper became a great artist by being acutely loyal to a family of strangely important experiences that many people had, but had hitherto ignored.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Picasso described a similar move to a photographer, George Brassaï, who was visiting his studio in 1943. They were looking at his Bull Head, made the year before.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Guess how I made the bull&#8217;s head?’ Picasso asked. ‘One day, in a pile of objects all jumbled up together, I found an old bicycle seat right next to a rusty set of handlebars. In a flash, they joined together in my head. The idea of the <em>Bull&#8217;s Head</em> came to me before I had a chance to think. All I did was weld them together&#8230;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you were only to see the bull&#8217;s head and not the bicycle seat and handlebars that form it, the sculpture would lose some of its impact.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In bicycle repair shops, scrap-heaps and people backyards, there could have been many occasions when people playfully thought that handle-bars are a bit like horns or that a seat sort of looks like an animal’s head. But no one thought to take this seriously and make the best possible version of it &#8211; until Picasso came along and did so. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today we might typically see the artist as someone who is at odds with Capitalism, who breaks rules, who goes to wild parties and who relishes unsettling experiences.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But really, the underlying ambition of the artist is not at all like this. The mission of the true artist is to identify, and commodify, precious experiences. The process of looking carefully at what has been overlooked is common ground for good art and good business; the good business thinker is in effect an artist &#8211; and the good artist is a fledgling entrepreneur.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">b) Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>What is empathy?</strong> Normally we use<em> sympathy</em> and <em>empathy</em> rather interchangeably but they can be used to mark out an important difference. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sympathy:</strong> This is when you feel close to someone on the basis of a shared experience. Even if you’re not having that experience right now, you clearly remember having it and can tap into that memory to grasp what’s going on for the other person. If you really struggled with maths homework and now your child does, you sympathise with their difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3199575758_65e1a605f5_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7123" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3199575758_65e1a605f5_b.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="3199575758_65e1a605f5_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Empathy:</strong> This is a trickier phenomenon. It happens when you haven’t had a certain kind of experience, but you can combine bits of your imaginative memory to explore what it would be like. If you found maths easy and always dashed off your homework with zero fuss, but your child frets, gets stuck at every point, resists and weeps, you can’t use <em>sympathy</em> to get inside their experience. If they say ‘you don’t know what it’s like’, they’re actually right in this case: you don’t. But that’s not the end of the story. Because we can use our imagination to build bridges from things we do know about from the inside to this new territory. You know what it’s like to be frustrated. You understand the fear of humiliation. You know what it’s like to feel that something is maddeningly incomprehensible &#8211; last week you tried to reset the timer on the new oven. From these relevant fragments you can imaginatively piece together a feel for something you’ve never directly experienced yourself: bewildered rage directed at the apex of an isosceles triangle. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So empathy gives a confident woman the possibility of grasping what it might be like to be a shy man in a sports club changing room or enables the CFO of a major company to feel tenderness for the concerns of an under-appreciated poet. (In practice, though, we only occasionally get round to undertaking the required empathetic exercises.) </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Empathy is the capacity to enter into the hidden desires and unspoken needs and pains of people who are not from your tribe. It allows us to take seriously what might it be like to be someone else. Empathy is also a crucial factor in the growth of many enterprises &#8211; and the lack of it is a huge (though easily ignored) obstacle to success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>So how can we get into the minds of other people? </strong>The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu says that, when we meditate, the ego can be overcome and we should be able to inhabit anything via the imagination. We can, for a time, cease to be ourselves and feel our way into being anything on the planet: wind, trees, rocks, rivers, a lonely child, a powerful king. The mind can be everywhere. Lao Tzu even puts forward a weird but fruitfully poetic idea that the whole world is really one mind, one thing, and that only fear separates us and makes us individuated. It’s a fanciful idea, and not literally true, but it’s getting at something important. It’s an emphatic assertion of a crucial insight that can be restated in simpler terms: we can use our imagination to identify with things we’re not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7433953100_814581e2dc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7099" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7433953100_814581e2dc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="7433953100_814581e2dc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2">Lao Tzu: an invitation to be, for a time, the rocks, the sea, the clouds.</h5>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">We need to get used to flexing our empathetic muscles. </span></strong>The easiest way to do this is to imagine what it might be like to be a man or a woman, whichever of the two we are not. It means wondering what would it be like to wear tights, or to have an erection or to have breasts.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01566/Sean_Bean__1566553a.jpg?resize=300%2C450" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fact that we don’t readily explore these possibilities alerts us to something key. Fear holds us back. </span>We’re very wedded to maintaining the point of view we’ve already formed. We’ve made a host of choices about the kind of person we are, and we’re inclined to defend them. The imaginative exercise at the heart of empathy &#8211; imagining yourself as other than you are &#8211; gives rise to a range of anxieties.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might discover that some of our choices are actually not very good or compelling; that we were wrong in thinking we had to live the way we do. But we’re already deeply invested in our life and it’s terrifying to think of unwinding those commitments. What if it would have  been better, after all, to live as a woman or a man?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might discover we are gayer than we think, which could be very threatening if we’ve lived in an environment that makes a big issue of this. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might be so scared of poverty or age that we’re deeply uncomfortable with really letting our minds settle into the thought experiment of supposing we were chronically short of money or that we were already nearing the end of our lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our anxieties inhibit our capacity for empathy. We need help.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Novelists are the world&#8217;s masters at empathy. We can learn a lot about empathy by looking at their work.</span></strong></p>

<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"> Trying out what it might be like to be a Roman Emperor</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a long novel, published in 1951, entitled <em>Memoirs of Hadrian,</em> the French writer Marguerite Yourcenar set herself a huge task around empathy. She wanted to write not simply about the Roman emperor Hadrian, she wanted to write from his point of view. And to do that she’d have to enter imaginatively into what it was like to be him. She was a woman, living in a small flat in New York, used to taking taxis and boiling the kettle, whose direct experience of power might have been limited to hiring someone to repaint the bedroom. Hadrian was master of the known world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She did lots of research. She found out about Roman history, she read up on their religious assumptions, the background horizon and politics, the structure of family life, what they had for dinner, how the postal-system operated and how many slaves an emperor might have. But she wasn’t only trying to find out about Hadrian’s world. She was asking a more radical and creative question: what would it be like actually to be him?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7126" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2">Marble bust of Hadrian</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do you need to consider to &#8216;be&#8217; in the shoes of someone else? How to overcome all the assumptions about existence that are (to you) normally &#8216;invisible&#8217; &#8211; the deep unspoken picture of normality we carry around with us all the time? It’s so familiar, we tend not even to notice it’s there. But it simply doesn’t apply to the lives of many other people. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So in order to get herself into Hadrian’s toga, Yourcenar posed a series of questions to herself. To find out what it would be like to be someone else she asked: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what&#8217;s my body like?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how much money do I have?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what am I scared of?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what&#8217;s my life expectancy?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how do I feel about death?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how will I be judged a success or a failure? What&#8217;s expected of me?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what turns me on?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what makes me angry?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- if I wake at 3am, what thoughts run through my head? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how do i feel about my own appearance? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what do I want?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how does time look to me?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To expand our capacity for customer empathy, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> l</span>ike a novelist, we need to take ourselves imaginatively into the bodies, fears, hopes, frustrations and loves of another person. But the goal isn&#8217;t to write a novel, it&#8217;s to generate more effective products and services. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>1. THE INCUBATOR</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Nepal &#8211; as in other parts of the developing world &#8211; there is a high rate of infant mortality. Babies die from </span>conditions that in other countries would be non-fatal because the baby could be cared for in an incubator.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> In 2008, a team from Stanford University set out to address the problem and increase the number of incubators available. At first, one might think this was primarily a matter of how to finance the supply of additional incubators. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a more empathic approach revealed that the problem had other &#8211; very different &#8211; dimensions. Most of the children who needed such care won’t, in fact, be in hospital. And there won’t be access to electricity. The staff using them won’t have elaborate training. To be effective, it was necessary to design a new kind of incubator that would be easily transportable, wouldn’t require power, would be simple to operate, clean and easy to maintain and not too costly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image33.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7103" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image33.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="image33" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Embrace</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team created a product which doesn’t look at all like a modern high-tech incubator. It’s a sort of bag, rather than a kind of ultra-sophisticated box.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But it does many of the same things well. And its cost was utterly transformed from about $20,000 to around $25 per unit. The problem was solved not by a new scientific discovery (all the relevant science was already in circulation) but by a wonderful exercise of empathy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">2. THE SHORTCUT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many small areas of urban greenery &#8211; which have been carefully provided with bitumen paths &#8211; are crisscrossed by worn-down trails over the grass where people have taken shortcuts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7094286453_af092c55e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7104" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7094286453_af092c55e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="7094286453_af092c55e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Flickr/Alan Stanton</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The shortcut is a small &#8211; but revealing &#8211; instance of a practical failure of empathy. The landscape architects who plotted the official paths didn’t sufficiently think themselves into the lives of other people. The designers may themselves not mind taking a slightly longer route round the edge of a grassy area. Their professional enthusiasm leads them instinctively to avoid damaging the grass. But most people don’t feel that way at all. They aren’t thinking of the delicate new shoots, they’re just in a hurry to get wherever they’re going. If the planning process had included a dedicated session on empathy they’d have re-routed the path &#8211; or added a new one &#8211; to follow the course that, to most people, makes most sense. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">3. HOTEL NOISE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’re in a hotel room on a warm night. It’s a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>relief that the room has air conditioning and when you arrived a helpful porter explained how you set it to the ideal temperature. But in the quiet of the night you realise there’s a problem. The cooling system makes an uncomfortably loud clicking noise. You try to ignore it. It seems to get louder. You reconcile yourself as best you can to a miserable night and make a vow never to return to this place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The management of the hotel have failed in empathy. In this case they had an unusually concrete opportunity to put themselves in the shoes of others. Before installing this air conditioning system, some very senior person should have undertaken the empathic experiment of passing a night in its company. (In the process they might also have discovered that it takes several bewildering minutes to master the lighting switches and the the cord of the hairdryer is inconveniently short.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> They didn’t build enough empathy into their decisons, so they didn’t test the experience<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of the guest strongly enough. And now their repeat business is suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">4. &#8216;SQUISHY GRIP&#8217; ORAL B</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’d think that the handle of a kid’s toothbrush should be thinner than one designed for adults. Obviously, children’s hands are smaller, so you reduce the proportions. And that’s how it was from the first children’s brushes until very recently. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oralB_gripper_hero_626px.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7107" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oralB_gripper_hero_626px.jpg?resize=635%2C314" alt="oralB_gripper_hero_626px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But all along, the industry hadn’t paid attention to something: children typically hold the brush a different way. They make a fist, rather than mainly use their fingers (which is how adults tend to do it). For the whole-hand technique, it’s actually better to have a fatter, softer handle. By looking carefully at what children actually did with toothbrushes, Oral-B came up with the ‘squishy grip’, a big fat squashy handle. It makes it easier for children to control and so they can give their teeth a better clean. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It took a long time to get a better understanding of children’s needs around toothbrushes for a basic reason: the people who design oral-hygiene implements aren’t themselves children. There’s a gap between the typical experiences of the creator and the unexpressed needs of the customer. It wouldn’t help for the people designing the brushes to think more and more carefully about their own needs in this area. They had to shift the basis of their thinking and start imagining what it would be like to be<em> unlike</em> them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They were starting to explore a key resource of business creativity: empathy. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">‘Creativity’ has become one of the most highly praised and prestigious concepts in modern business. Corporations are extremely keen to have a lot of it around and worry whenever it may be in decline. A large and lucrative market has emerged, feeding off some ill-focused insecurities. At worst, in a bid to increase creativity, senior executives might be sent to do some finger painting or else are let loose on a dressing-up box.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3324241858_7178e667f9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7044" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3324241858_7178e667f9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3324241858_7178e667f9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p>But business creativity is a little different from artistic creativity. A company is a group of individuals gathered together to solve a problem for other people. This helps to define what the true focus of business creativity should be: intense and lateral thinking about what could be missing from the lives of customers. Business creativity means skill at identifying and profitably meeting the needs (many of them unspoken and vague) of customers. Everything else &#8211; the factories, the technology, the logistics, the spreadsheets &#8211; is in a sense secondary to this aim; whatever efforts are subsequently lavished on execution, a business cannot succeed if it hasn’t zeroed in on a real, that is, sufficiently urgent, human requirement.</p>
<p class="p1">Competition in capitalism is a constant struggle by companies to find more accurate accounts of the needs of their consumers. A good business is one that has understood needs better than its competitors. Therefore, the creativity that really counts &#8211; and that companies should attempt to foster &#8211; is the one that best helps a business enter the minds of its customers accurately and powerfully.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ON STANDING BACK</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stresses of running any business with even moderate success are pretty much all consuming. It’s no wonder, therefore, if enterprises sometimes lack the time to stand back and think creatively about innovation &#8211; and suffer accordingly down the line.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only a few companies can afford to send their teams to reflect on business in fancy lodges on the sides of mountains, but we can all get into the mindset such places are ideally meant to promote. We can get into the habit of mentally ‘standing back’ &#8211; and wondering whether the future of our business could be a bit different, and richer, than its past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four big questions that can generate fruitful thinking:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image41.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7030" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image41.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image41" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four ‘Stand Back’ Questions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. What might your customer secretly be hoping for?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds odd but many customers privately (and unclearly) harbour hopes of companies that go a long way beyond what these companies are currently offering. A great way to innovate is to tap into these secret hopes and build products and services to meet them. The possibilities for growth can be enormous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take some of the hopes that hover around the travel industry. Consider the Four Seasons hotel on the Caribbean island of Nevis. What it offers its customers currently includes: a set of bungalows with plunge pools, a spa, tennis courts, a three star restaurant and water-skiing facilities. But it&#8217;s evident that these elements don&#8217;t represent the limit of the hopes that customers might be bringing to the hotel when they go there, the travellers might also be hoping that:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they can finally sort out anxieties around their careers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- their relationships with their children could improve</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they would reconnect with their partner</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image31.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7031" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image31.png?resize=635%2C336" alt="image31" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These three hopes are not currently addressed, but to take each of them seriously could mean setting up three new businesses (a professional development coach, a family therapist, marriage counselling).</span></p>
<p class="p1">Or let’s look at some of the secret hopes people bring to financial services companies. When we step back, a bank is not just a place to store money safely, with a competitive interest rate and decent customer service. We want these things, of course, but the less articulate secret hope is about something else: living well around money.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to money, we have questions about how to deal with envy, worries about what to spend money on, speculations about how to make money and desires for how to teach children about the value of money. There are big opportunities for the financial sector in understanding more correctly people’s biggest needs and ambitions around cash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wide path to growth emerges whenever companies see themselves as being able to tackle not just a local issue but one of the big themes of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Are there neighbouring problems you could fix?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Does the problem that you’re fixing exist somewhere else and would it make sense for you to fix it there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The designer Giorgio Armani founded his clothing business in 1975 and soon found widespread success. What motivated him was the desire to fix the chaos and clutter of the world &#8211; and he did this by giving his audience an experience of simple elegance delivered via clothes.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                     <a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image15.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7032" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image15.png?resize=230%2C345" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But with time, Armani realised that similar problems &#8211; of clutter, chaos, mess, disorder &#8211; could be identified in other areas of life. He’d fixed it in one area, could he now move on to addressing it in others? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Armani company grew from clothes to perfumes to hotels and furniture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image30.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7037" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image30.png?resize=635%2C422" alt="image30" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"> Armani Hotel: Milan</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Might you take the same Message into a different Medium?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy for a company to become fixated on the medium in which it first launched &#8211; and therefore to fail to see that its message (which is the really valuable bit) could happily and lucratively transfer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can happen to artists. Andy Warhol began his career making paintings. His values &#8211; an ironic, half-critical, half-loving look at the ephemera of American life &#8211; seemed ideally and perhaps exclusively suited to canvas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image29.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7038" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image29.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image29" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But with time, Warhol stepped back and came to a richer realisation. His message could as happily exist in a book, a film, some photographs or a magazine. Which is how he came to make a two-minute film of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>himself eating a hamburger from Burger King.</span></p>
<p class="p1">

</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same manoeuvre can be made in business. For a long time, Michael Heseltine’s company, Haymarket Publishing, believed that it should exclusively focus on making magazines. But in the mid-1990s, Heseltine realised (these things always sound simple) that he had stuck a little too loyally to what was, after all, only the <em>medium</em> &#8211; and that his <em>message</em> (information relevant for businesses) could exist in many other media, an idea that lay behind a decision to start an event company, a digital platform and a consulting arm.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. What is the Bigger Version of your current activity?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of any current business activity we can ask ourselves: what is the bigger version of this? One can ask</span>: what is the underlying principle within the business? And what would it look like for the business to apply that principle in larger ways?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s take a very small thing indeed, a paperclip &#8211; and ask what the bigger version of this is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7039" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image07.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When teasing out the underlying principle of a business, we shouldn&#8217;t look at what the business actually does as the move it is making. So the principle of a nut manufacturer isn’t making nuts, it is making healthy snacks. The principle of a phone company isn’t making phones, it is communication. This means that one can imagine the business operating in ways that are utterly faithful to its principles and yet with quite different products and services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The underlying principle of the paperclip company is<strong> temporary order</strong>. The paperclip is a beautifully simple micro tool devoted to keeping sheaves of paper in order, while allowing them to be easily released. It was an advance on binding (which also orders papers but in a more permanent fashion, at odds with the need to extract particular sheets). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The larger version of this activity could lie in filing cabinets, shelving, bags and briefcases. Because in each case the same principle is involved. One day, the paperclip company could logically get around to car parks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image38.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7040" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image38.png?resize=451%2C451" alt="image38" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take a company that is currently making <strong>ear plugs</strong>. Its underlying principle is quiet. It’s tapping into the need for <strong>serenity</strong>: focus in a noisy world, where sound is a disturbing and intrusive factor. This could lead it into a range of new markets; noise-cancelling equipment, acoustic insulation or scented candles that promote tranquility. They might develop a brand of fee-paying luxury restrooms that are havens of quiet or reinvent the monastery as a quiet secular retreat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After some time in the metaphorical ski lodge, with some leaning back, we get….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Current-Activity.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7041" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Current-Activity.png?resize=619%2C288" alt="Current Activity" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Let’s consider some recent examples of companies that stepped back to find their macro position in the scheme of things, and that properly asked how they fitted into a good life.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"> CASE STUDIES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LinkedIn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When LinkedIn was launched in 2003, the founders and management understood the company as being in the CV exchange business. Professionals &#8211; including potential employers &#8211; could view each others resumes and develop online and real life connections. </span>However, recently, the company started to see itself from a far larger, less explored perspective. They realised that the huge underlying business opportunity was to try to match people’s true talents with the commercial needs of the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So LinkedIn redefined its mission as that of assisting everyone in getting the right, ideal job for them. To do this they would need consider a much broader range of issues, including: What are people&#8217;s real talents? How can people get to know them? How can talents be developed into skills? And how can proficiency in skills be demonstrated and proved to a global range of employers suspicious of the very variable and sometimes faulty markers of the current education system?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are much bigger challenges than making sure your CV gets to the right HR department. For instance, a person might be too distracted to explore their own minds. Or they might overestimate their abilities in a particular direction; or they might be lacking a convincing badge to prove what they can actually do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LinkedIn has finally broached what was always the big underlying &#8211; if tacit &#8211; longing of its users: that a company should be devoted to making sure they end up in the right job. A bigger</span> future for LinkedIn therefore involves expansion into a range of areas:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Therapeutic career assessment:</strong> a major problem around making the best use of one’s abilities is the difficulty in working out what kind of work one is suited to. This can be a life-long concern. We might easily be swayed by unhelpful expectations from others (a pushy family, a peer group that’s very competitive around status). Existing services in this area are expensive, unreliable and accessing them still feels like an unusual thing to do. The huge opportunity for LinkedIn is to deliver this universally and inexpensively through the user of artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Training materials:</strong> </span>The very recent $1.5 billion acquisition by LinkedIn of the education material supplier Lynda.com has been guided by the idea that in order to realise potential &#8211; and thus end up with the most satisfying work &#8211; people need to enhance their skills. It’s obviously not a new idea in itself. The education on offer, however (unlike what typically happens in schools and universities), is focused on helping people do their jobs better.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves are an increasingly accurate assault on the fundamental problems the exchange of CVs was circling round: how to help people build good careers and how to help businesses build the workforces they ideally need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Airbnb</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was started in 2008, the founders of Airbnb originally conceived of their business as providing extra travel accommodation. </span>The company grew very quickly on a huge scale.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, though, Airbnb has reconsidered the business it is in, as a way of understanding how they can and should expand their operations. Conventional logic might have suggested they grow into an airline service (their customers do a lot of flying) or a bank (they are highly trusted around financial transactions). But instead they have structured their expansion plans around fulfilling some of the deeper hopes of travel. Not being able to find accommodation is one of the potential obstacles to happiness away from home. But there are lots of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14348806215_49c842bda3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7064" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14348806215_49c842bda3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="14348806215_49c842bda3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/expat-photographer</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get a handle on these, Airbnb has been studying what actually goes on when people travel. They have tracked individuals and families in detail, checking up on their heart rate, mood and anxiety levels. They&#8217;re discovering a lot of things that are going wrong with journeys:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Not really knowing where to go or why</em>: the modern world is hugely invested in the general idea of travel and has large &#8211; but vague &#8211; hopes for what travel could deliver. But the travel industry on the whole operates on the assumption that people already know what they are looking for, the task is only to get them them there. And yet we&#8217;re constantly ending up in places where we don&#8217;t entirely know what to do (and so end up going to the museum; a trip has arguably always gone wrong by the time we&#8217;ve ended up in the museum).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> To address this Airbnb is focusing on diagnostic help. Instead of asking ‘where do you want to go?’, they want to expand via the question: ‘what are you hoping to get from travel?’ They want to deliver a more psychotherapeutically informed travel-advisory service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Troubles of the self</em>: one can have a hideous row in the perfect bridal suite, feel anxious and lonely on a coral island, get bored in New York… The problem isn’t necessarily the place: there are petals on the bed, the white sand is perfect, the Frick Collection is around the corner. The problem is in us, we bring our distracted minds, our worries and frustrations with us. But up to now, the whole travel industry has been focused on only one half of the equation. In order to unlock the hopes of travel, Airbnb is now looking at:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Solving loneliness when travelling: by developing an introduction service, essentially making its platform social.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Using travel as a time to interact with other people in your line of work while on the move, to learn new things (a networking social version of LinkedIn).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Romantic travel: helping couples to get on better</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7067" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">These are radical innovations in the travel business. But they are not random. They are highly focused expansions that target the underlying hopes of travel, which Airbnb initially got involved in by addressing what turned out to be one small part of a vast issue.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
<p>The Green movement often attacks business for filling the world with junk. It tell us that we already have more than enough and therefore that the growth-focused agenda of business is evil. But the argument here is that business actually has to grow (and can grow in admirable directions) because companies are still so bad at fulfilling needs. There are still so many things that customers want and yet which aren’t being provided. These things are not trivial distractions or extravagant indulgences. They are central supports for the good, flourishing lives we rightly aspire to lead.</p>
<p class="p1">Innovation is the key because &#8211; in the sense we’ve been exploring &#8211; it is the process of working out business-solutions to problems that are most important to us. The products that any company is currently offering might only small part of the customer&#8217;s real needs in a given area. Creatively re-defining the business area that a company is in can radically alter the sense of what its core tasks might be &#8211; and where its future opportunities might lie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Science fiction has, quite unfairly, developed rather a bad name for itself. It’s seen as a subgenre consumed primarily by young males and obsessed by the very worst, often goriest possibilities for the future. In fact, science fiction is a much underestimated tool in business. In its utopian, as opposed to dystopian, versions, it’s exploring what we might ideally want the future to be like &#8211; a little ahead of our practical abilities to mould it as we would wish.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/img1.mxstatic.com/wallpapers/3fe7394fd670b9b7311b5be52e2a8048_large.jpeg?resize=717%2C404" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Science fiction doesn’t of course contain the answers (how actually to make a jetpack or a robot that loves you). Rather, it encourages something that is logically prior to technological mastery: the identification of a particular need that one would badly want solved. The inventors of eighteenth-century England weren’t just technically more adept than the Ancient Romans (who had, after all, very successfully built aqueducts and concrete ceilings); because of certain socio-economic conditions (especially taboos around the use of slaves in the coal mines of the Midlands), the English entrepreneurial classes also wanted steam engines rather more urgently than their Roman predecessors ever had.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>20,000 Leagues under the Sea,</em> published in 1870, Jules Verne narrates the adventures of the Nautilus, a large submarine that tours the world’s oceans often at great depth (the 20,000 leagues &#8211; about 80,000 kilometres &#8211; refer to the distance travelled.) When writing the story, Verne didn’t worry too much about solving every technical issue involved with undersea exploration: he was just pinning down what it would be great one day to have. He describes the Nautilus as being equipped with a huge widow even though he had no idea how to make glass that could withstand pressure at great depth. He imagined the vessel having a machine that could make seawater potable, though the science behind desalination was extremely primitive at the time. And he described the Nautilus as powered by batteries &#8211; even though this technology was in its infancy.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Wouldn’t glass shatter at that pressure?’ Keeping such questions at bay for long enough to shape a vision.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jules Verne wasn’t an enemy of technology. He was deeply fascinated by practical problems. It’s just that in writing his novels, he held off from worrying too much about the ‘how’ questions. He brought the <em>idea</em> of the submarine into the minds of millions of people long before the technology that would allow the concept to take hold practically was in place. Eventually, of course we need to answer the ‘how’ questions. But science fiction reminds us that we can start elsewhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6999" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image13.png?resize=635%2C298" alt="image13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We got there eventually.</h5>
<p class="p1">A central message of the science fiction genre is: for a time, don’t worry too much about <em><strong>how</strong></em> it’s all going to happen. Let&#8217;s just take the time to imagine the future first: people communicating telepathically, prospective partners chosen by brilliantly accurate computers, robots with deep emotional lives&#8230; The fact that we don’t at present know how to do any of these things shouldn’t hold us up. We need practice at concentrating on the way we want things to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dystopian sci-fi &#8211; the <em>Mad Max</em> scenario in which the future is imagined as being awful &#8211; isn’t where we need help. It’s only too easy to picture disaster. We’re almost always too preoccupied by anxieties around how anything could be achieved that we simply don’t get round to picturing what we’d actually like. So we need the sort of science fiction that encourages us to concentrate closely for a time on the positive developments we want to see happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jules Verne is a constant inspiration in this area. In his 1865 novel, <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>, he expands on the thought of how great it would be to orbit and then land on the moon. He lets himself imagine this without getting embarrassed by the normally fatal objection that such an adventure was entirely beyond the reach of the available technology. He is addressing another part of the mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7000" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image05.png?resize=635%2C605" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We shouldn’t feel surprised that it all seems so real, though it was originally only imagined. It is real <em>because</em> it was first imagined.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his story, Verne imagines that the United States would launch a mission to the moon from a base in Florida. He fantasised that the craft would be made of the lightest metal he knew (aluminium) &#8211; which turned out to be right. He assigned what seemed an unspeakably vast price tag to the venture; the equivalent of more than the entire GDP of France at the time. And that, too, turned out to be a very respectable guess at how much the Apollo programme would cost. It was an amazingly prescient imaginative description. His vastly popular book didn’t help engineers, but it did something that in the long run was perhaps more significant. It brought forward the idea that it would be wonderful to do this kind of thing. It fostered the aspiration, which &#8211; in time &#8211; came to be (just) viable.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inventions don’t actually start with discoveries of what it is technologically possible to do. They have a more extended history. They begin when people identify a longing &#8211; and to get to that longing, we may have to park practical considerations for long enough to imagine them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, the mobile phone made its debut in 1966, not in the labs of a tech company but on television screens, in the original series of <em>Star Trek</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7003" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C211" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The full range of uses of today’s phones wasn’t quite in focus. The film people didn’t think to get Captain Kirk to scroll down a twitter feed or swipe potential sex-partners on nearby planets.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image0311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7012" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image0311.jpg?resize=635%2C213" alt="image031" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But all the same, the core idea is brought powerfully to consciousness. One longs to have one of those too. In this sense, <em>Star Trek</em>  invented the wireless headset:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image32.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7005" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image32.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="image32" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the later incarnation of the series, <em>The Next Generation,</em> we encounter the origins of the iPad:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7007" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image171.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="image17" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mental move &#8211; ‘what would we want to happen one day?’ &#8211; has until now often focused on technology, but it doesn’t only have to operate here. The core concern is simply: where might our as-yet-unfulfilled needs take us? What would it be really nice to have? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such questions are capable of being levelled at a diverse range of human concerns. Take relationships. After two or three disastrous unions with people, primarily caused by weird kinks in their and our psychological histories, we might start to wonder how nice it would be if people had training in relationships that could be as rigorous as that currently given to commercial pilots. In the future, one might consider it bizarre ever to date anyone who hadn’t gone through at least 10,000 hours of classroom and practical training with the best minds in the field. Right now, there’s a modest industry of relationship counselling. It’s something a smallish fraction of people encounter and the results are often mixed. But, in an exercise comparable to Jules Verne’s moves, one could ask: what would it be like if a version of relationship counselling became one of the largest undertakings in society? It’s not such a mad thought experiment because relationship problems are truly amongst the most significant we ever face. The issues &#8211; of compromise, forgiveness, how to work out who might be right for one, how to cope with disappointment, how to help another person develop &#8211; could one day, perhaps, be handled by practiced, reliable instructors. We’d treat having relationships the way we treat getting a license to captain an A380: you’d need to demonstrate your abilities on a lesser scale first and you’d be tested in simulated practice around many component skills (resolving an argument, apologising, planning a family holiday &#8211; just as pilots now practice navigating over the Singapore Straits at night).</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Through such science fictional experiments, one gets into the habit of wondering how it would be if our world changed. These work to counteract our tendency to inhibit thinking around things that seem (at the moment) unlikely. And that’s extremely important, because when we look backwards we realise that, repeatedly, things that once seemed unlikely have come to play a huge role in our lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7009" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We all have a science fiction side to our brains, which we are generally not used to giving free reign to. But creating the dream allows the space in which later patient development can happen. It gives us permission to wonder. It helps us to know what we’d really like to be true, and thereby gives us the energy to help one day make it so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">For most of human history, people haven&#8217;t believed that the world changes very much, or that change is ever very good. Stability and security have been the ideals. News used to spread slowly, technology hardly evolved, few people ever travelled and trades were handed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Les_Très_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_février.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6659" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Les_Très_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_février.jpg?resize=635%2C615" alt="©Photo.

<h6>Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry Manuscript</h6>
<p>But today, all that has changed. Most people regard profound, widespread and frequent change as inescapable and a good thing too. Change is now strongly associated with progress. A dominant picture has evolved of what the properly modern person is supposed to be like: someone who not only accepts change but who seeks it out, embraces it, drives it. When Steve Jobs wanted to convince John Sculley, president of Pepsi-Cola, to become CEO of the (then) much smaller Apple &#8211; he is reported as having asked him: ‘Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?’</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_522695099.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6660" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_522695099.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_(522695099)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The word ‘change’, in that famous phrase, has a powerful resonance. To change the world, Jobs seemed to be implying, is the most important, most admirable and most worthwhile thing a person can do with their life. And yet, the logical question &#8211; why is this change meant to be so important &#8211; does not get much of a look in.</p>
<p>We live in a culture that is always encouraging us to change. The fashion industry, for instance, thrives on rapid shifts of preferences. It has to persuade us that what was great last year isn’t much good this year. A car manufacturer wants to get us to change to their latest model. A new restaurant hopes to get us to alter our dining habits. There are many forces at play, encouraging us to feel that change is good and exciting, not because this is always a major truth &#8211; but largely because business models requires it.</p>
<p>Change may be inevitable. But our relationship to change can be better or worse. We can use change well or we can be baffled and distressed by change. We can grow or diminish. This essay explores the four key problems that can occur around change &#8211; and what we can do about them.</p>
<p><strong>One: When we expect too much of change</strong></p>
<p>In science and technology, progress can be immensely impressive. The prototype helicopter built by Paul Cornu in 1907 was a hugely gallant contraption of plywood, string and bicycle wheels. But it is much less good at vertical take-off and hovering than the latest Sikorsky. There’s no dispute. The direction of change is clear and the sense of progress is obvious. Medicine provides endless instances of the same kind. The compelling nature of such examples can seduce us into supposing that change in general brings marvellous benefits. They encourage an excess of optimism. We extend the hopefulness which is entirely justified in specific areas like rotor blades and antibiotics and extended it to other areas where its relevance and legitimacy are, in fact, much less secure.</p>
<p>Such as politics. Think of the people who climbed onto the Berlin Wall in November 1989. The popular uprising had succeeded. It was clear that the East German state was collapsing. The mood was buoyant. Their troubles were over. Now they were free. There were huge, euphoric celebrations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6662" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>At the Brandenburg Gate, 10 November 1989</h6>
<p>It may well be argued that life is indeed better now in the East than it was in the past, under Communism. But it is far from perfect. Competition has led to unemployment. For many people, life is less secure. Today almost half the population say that the old East Germany was more good than bad.</p>
<p>The Fall of the Berlin Wall was a momentous, profound change. Yet at the time many people overestimated the benefits it would bring. It is an historic instance of a more general truth. That we tend to expect too much of change. We believe it will deliver more than it really does. Changes which look as if they must be wholly positive, turn out to have unforeseen drawbacks. This may be a natural bias of the mind. In order to summon the will to action, to rouse ourselves and our society from inertia, it may be that we have to tactically overestimate the advantages that will accrue.</p>
<p>The same ambivalence can be witnessed around the advantages of marriage, divorce, moving country, inheriting a fortune, changing one’s family lawyers, shifting the children’s schools. It’s not to say that these <em>never</em> bring the results we hope. Sometimes they do. It’s just that very often we forget that there will be new problems &#8211; as well as some real gains.</p>
<p>The new house will never be everything we can imagine the perfect house being; the new spouse will still be maddening in some ways, the new school will be wrong for the children in new ways; the new lawyers will still be pedantic about law.</p>
<p>The antidote is history. That is, the encounter with how hope played out in the past. Political history is one place we can study this. In 1997, and again in 2008, newspapers around the world were filled with excitement at the election of Tony Blair and Barack Obama. In each case, it was confidently declared, the tide of the UK or the US was turning, great things would soon be happening. Change was in the air. But a respectful and fair analysis of what happened next is sobering. The results were very mixed &#8211; as these men would be the first to admit. There were as many failures as successes. Rather than condemn them, we should draw a lesson from the experience of these leaders. Things rarely work out as well as we enthusiasts think they will.</p>
<p>We need to generalise this historical wisdom. It applies not only to Presidents and Prime Ministers but to the lesser &#8211; and to us hugely important &#8211; changes we make in the running of our own lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/670px-Obama_portrait_crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6664" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/670px-Obama_portrait_crop.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="670px-Obama_portrait_crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The lesson of the Berlin Wall is not that change has no benefits. It is, rather, that if we expect too much we end up not appreciating the less dramatic, but actually real, advantages. It’s a question of sensitivity to scale. The intense celebratory atmosphere of late 1989 implied the dawn of a golden age, the radical improvement of everything. By the standard of such expectations subsequent history is a terrible let down. If you are expecting fireworks, a lone sparkler is disappointing. A more mature theory of change builds in the idea that quite a lot will &#8211; obviously &#8211; turn out badly. The benefits will be low-key, but actual. You have to adjust to a more modest scale to appreciate them.</p>
<p><strong>Two: When we underestimate the power of change</strong></p>
<p>For many generations, people in the ancient city of Pompeii lived a prosperous life. The soil was good, the climate was kindly. They built gracious houses. They planted vineyards on the slopes of nearby Mount Vesuvius</p>
<p>But all the while, the pressure of the magna inside the mountain was building up beneath the crater. No one realised; they thought all was well. They tended their orchards, gave dinner parties, struggled for status, bought works of art and, all the time, a cataclysmic change was coming. They just didn’t know how to tell. Occasionally the mountain would rumble, from time to time, a plume of smoke would rise from a cave on the upper slopes. But this had been happening as long as anyone could remember.</p>

<p>And then, on the 24th of August &#8211; in the year 79 AD &#8211; came the fatal moment. The volcano erupted; the city was buried under metres of ash. And all traces of their once bustling lives was lost.</p>
<p>The story of Pompeii gave rise to a view of change: Vulcanism &#8211; named after Vulcan, the god of fire and volcanoes. The story of Pompeii is so moving because we can identify with the victims. Like them, we go about our ordinary business on the natural assumption that whatever feels secure and solid today will be solid and secure tomorrow. Then a huge change comes along. And because we have not anticipated it, we are badly caught out.</p>
<p>In 2007/8 UK financial institutions that had been household names and high-street staples for decades &#8211; RBS, Lloyds TSB, Bradford and Bingley &#8211; were revealed to be deeply compromised. Only massive government intervention could keep them afloat. The major stock market index dropped dramatically.</p>

<p>When Thomas Edison showed off the first light bulb, it hardly looked like the world was about to change. It was a bizarre-looking contraption, utterly unlike anything people would want in their homes. Potential backers were deeply sceptical. But when the great banker J. P. Morgan saw it, he grasped its possibilities. It looked ridiculous, but only in superficial ways. Morgan saw past what was odd and off-putting and recognised that the lightbulb was actually a very normal idea in a strange guise. Morgan wasn’t getting carried away simply because something was new. In fact, in his eyes, the electric lightbulb was hardly novel at all. It was simply a more elegant response to a completely classic problem: how to keep on doing things when it&#8217;s dark outside.</p>
<p>It was in fact the basic similarity to gas lighting and even candles that struck Morgan. Where other people saw a strange new thing, he saw something basically very familiar. He was good at pattern recognition. He had the confidence, and wisdom, to see continuity when other people thought only in terms of disruption. He’d seen it before, with railroads and steel &#8211; he’d understood that these were simply new approaches to age-old problems. He established and held a major share in General Electric &#8211; one of the most successful corporations in the history of US business enterprise.</p>
<p>Morgan had learned to read the early signs of volcanic eruption. A wisp of smoke from a crater might have been shrugged off by many people &#8211; such things are always happening, so what, life goes on just as before, it never leads to anything. But Morgan had &#8211; as it were &#8211; studied other exploding mountains. He’d been around the railway and steel eruptions. So when the people involved in the gas lighting industry ended up buried under piles of ash, Morgan not only escaped, but was thriving.</p>
<p>When we underestimate opportunities and fail to see the potential for radical change, we deserve a good deal of sympathy. It is usually wiser to stick with what already works. The people who turned down Edison’s proposals were not stupid to do so. (Just as the many editors who rejected the manuscript of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>, by a then totally obscure Scottish woman called J.K. Rowling, were not bad editors.) Because there are few reliable signs of the momentous future of a manuscript or invention or &#8211; indeed &#8211; of a volcanic eruption.</p>

<p>When people first invoked the idea of a Volcano they were in search of a metaphor of random, capricious, mysterious change on a great scale. Why should the earth suddenly explode? They really did not know.</p>
<p>But the core error is this. It is believing that what is familiar will not change. You get used to gas lamps, so you find it hard to believe that in the space of a few years, they could largely disappear. You get used to a particular kind of book doing well and find it hard to imagine something very very different being a huge hit. You get used to your orchards being on the slopes of the hill.</p>
<p>The error has long fascinated philosophers. The best statement was provided by Bertrand Russell. He imagines a turkey which is used to being fed by the farmer. It hears the tread of the farmer&#8217;s boots and feels sure that &#8211; of course &#8211; it is about to be fed, as always. Then it’s the week before Christmas …. The problem was that the Turkey wasn’t a thinker. It relied too much on habit. True, when the farmer came round it was indeed to bring food, until the last day. A philosophical Turkey would have wondered why the farmer was doing this. And speculated on the reasons, so far unknown. The presence of a major unknown factor (‘why on earth does the farmer feed me …?’) would have haunted the imagination of the Turkey.</p>
<p>The response to complacency is not so much being continually on edge as the attempt to think more deeply.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6667" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan.jpeg?resize=635%2C502" alt="John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>J P Morgan was unusually adventurous and alive to the potential for change because he was good at asking the underlying, philosophical questions. He was not fixated on what they happened to be doing &#8211; lighting their streets and houses using gas. It was natural to him to wonder why people wanted gas lamps in the first place. And the answer &#8211; to get light &#8211; applied even more directly to the electric bulb than to gas. Hence his accurate prediction that change in this area would be quick and massive.</p>
<p>It’s maddening &#8211; but true &#8211; that we can underestimate the consequences of change and also overestimate them. We are prone to two kinds of error, which are opposite in character. We think change will solve everything. Then again we shrug it off and think that nothing really changes. It would be so much simpler if human nature had only one way of getting it wrong around change.</p>
<p><strong>Three: When change is frightening</strong></p>
<p>Despite the prestige of change, in reality we are often deeply disturbed by change. It’s not surprising. We learn how to cope &#8211; and thrive &#8211; in a given order of things. You know how the system works; you feel you have come to understand what works and what doesn’t. Then a big change comes along and your hard won knowledge no longer seems to work. The rules have changed. You built up good relationships with people, but they no longer run the show. Strategies that proved themselves over many years, no longer bring the results you want. There’s a new vocabulary, new buzzwords, new expectations.</p>
<p>Barney Barnato was born in London in 1852. He was a ticket tout, a music hall entertainer and a prize fighter before heading off to Africa. He dug for diamonds, struck lucky and built a business. By his mid-thirties, he was seriously rich &#8211; with a fortune of something like a billion GBP in today&#8217;s terms. He returned to London and to the consternation of existing residents built himself a huge house in Park Lane &#8211; the most fashionable address of the period.</p>
<p>Such things had not really happened much before. It had not been possible to come from a background like his and in only a decade or so emerge as rich (or richer) than most of the earls and dukes whose fortunes had been around for generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barney_Barnato00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6669" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barney_Barnato00.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="Barney_Barnato00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The existing elite reacted in a very defensive way. They used social snobbery to pretend it wasn’t happening. Barnato was an outcast. But it was a profound error. They dismissed change as unimportant because they didn’t like its effects. Instead of learning from him they rejected the lessons of his experience. They entrenched their views and were eclipsed as the dominant class by entrepreneurs. Instead of learning from his example &#8211; and renewing their own financial fortunes &#8211; they rejected everything he stood for, because he came from the wrong background.</p>
<p>Ironically, Barnato was not a real threat at all. In fact, his descendants were deeply interested in doing exactly the same things as the traditional elite. His son, Woolf Barnato, was educated at Cambridge, hunted, and became Chairman of Bentley Motors Limited. The only difference, was that Barnato’s descendants were very much better off.</p>
<p>And today Bentley’s ultra luxurious and chic handbag is named the Barnato, after Barney’s granddaughter.</p>

<h6>Inupiat in a kayak, Noatak, Alaska, c. 1929</h6>
<p>There is a general point to be draw from that specific story. Too often our fear gets in the way. It’s been discovered that the early Norwegian settlers in Greenland suffered terrible hardships, and eventually died out, because they refused to adopt the survival skills and strategies known to the Inuit inhabitants. The Norwegians could not believe that such strange looking &#8211; and apparently unsophisticated &#8211; people could teach them anything. To their fatal cost they refused to change, because the lesson was coming in a wrapping they didn’t much like. Likewise the English elite went into serious decline in the mid-twentieth century in large part because they were so resistant to learning about major economic changes. They refused the message because it came from people like Barney Barnato.</p>
<p>So the key move is to distinguish the fear of what is unfamiliar from what is a real threat. Barnato looked a bit rough, but he was not actually hostile. The Inuit had (to the Norwegians) weird things for lunch and odd mating rituals. But these things were merely unfamiliar and not genuinely a danger.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>The Nansen–Jackson meeting at Cape Flora, 17 June 1896</h6>
<p>The fear of change is really a way of addressing one of the most basic of all human concerns: establishing a hierarchy of value. We don’t go around every day announcing that we are trying to decide which of our values are primary and which secondary. Nevertheless, this is what deep down we are doing.</p>
<p>The grand people who didn’t invite Barnato to dinner were in effect saying that background is more important than achievement. This was the moral error that lay behind their anxiety about change. The same with the Norwegian settlers in Greenland. In their hierarchy of values, it (unfortunately) mattered more where an idea came from than whether it was any good. They would have coped much more successfully with change had they had a more accurate, better thought out, set of values. The philosophical challenge around change is to reassess the rankings of what we value.</p>
<p><strong>Four: When change is slow and messy</strong></p>
<p>In 1989, there was a photo shoot of Margaret Thatcher taken in the tiny kitchen of her flat in 10 Downing Street. The Iron lady, then in her last year as Prime Minister, can be seen smartly dressed squeezed between the sink and the stove. She’s just boiled the kettle and brewed a pot of tea.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/50465625.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6959" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/50465625.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="PM Margaret Thathcer pouring tea in kitc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the kind of photo op we take completely for granted today. We understand that Mrs Thatcher and her advisers were carefully exploring options for brushing up her credentials as an ordinary, likeable woman in touch with day-to-day reality. She puts the kettle on and makes everyone tea.</p>
<p>And yet, in previous ages, this sort of moment would have been deeply disturbing. If William Gladstone, when he was PM in 1893 had offered to go into a kitchen, find the tea and personally boil some water for the editor of the <em>Times,</em> his sanity would have been called into question.</p>
<p>The events leading up to Margaret Thatcher’s foray by the kitchen sink didn’t start on that particular day in 1989. They actually began about sixty-five years before with the Bloomsbury Group. A few young friends, mostly living in and around Gordon Square in North London, repudiated what they saw as the fussy, pompous attitudes of their parents&#8217; generation. At the time, their habits and attitudes were laughably eccentric. But gradually they spread.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SomeBloomsburymembers-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6673" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SomeBloomsburymembers-1.jpg?resize=635%2C382" alt="NPG Ax140432; Lady Ottoline Morrell; Maria Huxley (nÈe Nys); Lytton Strachey; Duncan Grant; Vanessa Bell (nÈe Stephen) by Unknown photographer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>Lady Ottoline Morrell, Maria Nys, Lytton Strachey, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell</h6>
<p>World War II put an end to domestic servants for the middle class and from the late 1960s, feminism started to challenge the idea that the kitchen was the woman’s realm. These successive waves of change eventually washed us towards the moment when the most powerful man in the nation would have to prove his ease by the kitchen sink. Far from seeming odd, it feels reassuring.</p>
<p>So, a huge number of diverse concerns overlapped and reinforced one another, and gradually the assumptions about what a trustworthy leader might look like changed.</p>
<p>In contrast to the dramatic, Volcano idea of change, the prime-ministerial tea-making shows the <em>Neptunist</em> vision of change &#8211; named after Neptune, the god of the sea &#8211; in action. Year on year, the waves gradually eat into the rocks, they shift the sand. Change occurs through little, imperceptible actions, day-by-day. We can’t believe that waves could win against the huge edifice of rock and turn it into sand.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/12326401623_6e6274bbe3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6960" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/12326401623_6e6274bbe3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C328" alt="12326401623_6e6274bbe3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The causal force is weak. It’s only water lapping. But repeated often enough the effect is monumental. This is deeply counter-intuitive. We find it hard to really grasp that such events can add up to great change. We know they do in theory &#8211; but we are often caught out. In fact, if you spend only a few hours at the beach, when the tide is going out, you might imagine that the sea itself is in retreat. But this, seen properly, is only a minor episode. It’s always ebbing and flowing but overall, decade by decade, the cumulative effect is huge.</p>
<p>Of course, we understand about tides. So we don’t panic when the water recedes and get terrified at the thought that the oceans are about to dry up. But in longer and more complex cycles we do indeed get very jittery. People new to the equity market often get overexcited by a sudden rise or unduly depressed by a steep decline. Judged hour by hour, it is wildly unstable.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6093690339_a09493f126_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6678" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/6093690339_a09493f126_z.jpg?resize=640%2C374" alt="Graph With Stacks Of Coins" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>There are moments where the direction of movement is uncertain. Yet in the long-run &#8211; despite all the huge number of small variations &#8211; the overall trend is clear.</p>
<p>People tend to be adept at recognising and responding to small, short-term changes. It’s not surprising. That’s what comes naturally. We have evolved to be good at it. Yet, in order to deal well with the big challenges of life we need to be able to grasp and deal with long-term changes. And the tricky thing is that often the pattern is far from obvious close up.</p>
<p>So, in 1989 the situation was much less obvious than it is now. At that crucial moment, political aides were trying to assess where the nation was, psychologically, on the idea of a leader pouring tea in a pokey kitchen. Was this going to come across as homely, or as fake? As impressive, or as a distraction. Might not voters worry that the Prime Minister should be attending to more weighty matters?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Permanence</strong></p>
<p>However much the external world changes, it is put in the shade by the alterations that occur at an intimate and personal level. The shift from being a child of eight to a youth of eighteen is utterly momentous. The change from being younger than most people to older than most can be profoundly unsettling. The person you got swept away by in a magical romance might turn into an annoying, cold-hearted spouse. Someone you admired from a distance, eventually becomes your friend and confidant. The child who was in awe of you and deeply impressed by everything is a few years on at loggerheads with your attitude to the politics of developing nations. The body that raced across the tennis court to return a treacherous backhand volley is (five minutes later &#8211; or so it feels) cautiously going down stairs or beset by strange pains. Personal change is along our own path to mortality.</p>
<p>It may be because we are so exposed to change in ourselves that &#8211; ultimately &#8211; we seek to make or protect things that will outlast ourselves. We have to learn to cope with change but often find ourselves deeply interested in things that resist change, that survive. The discussion of change leads to an intimate, and perhaps deeply important, question &#8211; what does one hope will not change?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Offices exist to help people collaborate. But lots goes wrong in the attempt. Some of the hurdles are procedural: meetings go on too long, everyone talks at the same time, the agenda isn’t right, there aren’t enough whiteboards, or the windows or breakout spaces are meanly proportioned. But many more of the problems are psychological in nature. People aren’t collaborating well because there’s too much defensiveness, irrational rivalry, people-pleasing, negativity, bluster, over-controlling behaviour, secret manoeuvring, unfriendliness or not-listening.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trying to overcome these hurdles is at one level a matter for every individual. But there are also office-wide solutions that companies can introduce to hugely improve the atmosphere among co-workers. We can address <em>personal</em> issues in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>political</em>, that is, collective and institutional, way. Issues that feel like they are intimate and purely personal &#8211; like being too bossy or a poor listener &#8211; can be usefully and constructively addressed at the level of an organisation’s habits and practices. An ambitious organisation can help people to do nothing less than mature. It can put in place practices that help individuals to recognise and deal with their emotional flaws (which, of course, everyone has in some way or another). That is a great contribution to the development of each person, but it is also precisely focused on improving how efficiently and effectively people work together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2276392858_77099a3abb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6902" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2276392858_77099a3abb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2276392858_77099a3abb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, the idea of IQ &#8211; intelligence quotient &#8211; had currency in evaluating people. It sought to assess the level of a person’s logical and reasoning abilities. And to some degree this was correlated with ‘employability’. The idea was that people in the upper percentiles would do better at work. However, close up, we can now see that whatever a person’s raw intellectual ability, their actual contribution at work is going to be hugely dependent on their degree of emotional maturity: their EQ.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IQ is understood as something that doesn’t change all that much across a life. EQ, on the contrary, can change dramatically. It’s built into the whole idea of maturity that we’re capable of acquiring it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- though we tend to do so in unreliable and uneven ways. In the workplace, we can improve the level of emotional maturity that we all attain. An organisation committed to raising EQ sets out to help people develop emotionally, by examining and resolving areas of immaturity and failures of collaboration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few steps to take on the path to a more mature and collaborative workspace:</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Collaboration is hard; we’re all crazy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6488" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">© Flickr/John Benson</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the great enemies of good collaboration is the sense that collaboration should essentially be easy, and that people are generally straightforward. A more helpful starting point is that collaborating is always hard and that all of us are a little crazy. There is no such thing as a wholly sane person and by the time you have 20 people in a room, the challenging psychodynamics are of mind-boggling complexity. Recognising this should lead to humility and a greater readiness to tread carefully, to apologise, to give way and &#8211; where necessary &#8211; to laugh warmly and generously at our foibles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a good collaborative office, there should be an attitude of honesty towards the challenges of working together. Getting frustrated with someone, starting to cry, falling into despair &#8211; these aren’t anomalies, they are what happens in any good life, when clever people get together and try to do difficult things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’d be a company-wide atmosphere of tolerance towards the quirks and eccentricities of human nature. The company would revere not just the strengths of great people; it would also honour and remember their weaknesses: Coco Chanel’s secrecy, Eisenhower’s inability to listen, Napoleon’s dogmatism, Henry James’s tardiness, Van Gogh’s scattiness…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6489" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg?resize=635%2C462" alt="640px-Coco_Chanel,_1920" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Time/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good collaborative office would know that the real problem isn’t having problems &#8211; it’s the attitudes of denial and the failure to be able to feed back on, and work through, issues that causes trouble. We don&#8217;t need people to be perfect: but we absolutely need them to want to recognise their flaws and to try to improve on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Campfire Meetings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the campfire is lit, the tension goes down; it’s the end of the day, the pressure is off a little. It’s the time to be honest and to share how things really are. In an EQ committed organisation, there are regular campfire meetings, usually on a Friday at 5pm. For an hour, everyone gathers, in groups of no more than twenty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A central purpose of the meetings is to develop a culture where it’s normal to confess to problems around working together and collaborating. There’s no stigma around having these problems, since it’s assumed from the start that everyone has difficulties of one kind or another. The issue isn’t whether there are psychological flaws: it’s a question of working out which ones and how they are interacting with those of others. The benign group pressure makes it much easier to admit to a failing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4576893185_8561c860d0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6903" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4576893185_8561c860d0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4576893185_8561c860d0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Greg Morgan</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stigma does, however, remain but in a different area. The topic for discussion is often: ‘What unhealthy dynamics do I feel in myself and how might I improve?’ It’s socially unacceptable not to have anything to say around this, not to try to do anything to improve or deal with issues. It’s normal to be crazy and it’s normal and indispensable to be committed to maturity. Confession isn’t an excuse. It’s tied to development. The EQ office is a Continuously Maturing Office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The meeting runs through points in the recent past where people lacked EQ. And there’s discussion of where individuals might develop specific skills or make use of particular insights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The meetings enforce a feeling of normality around maturation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">An EQ Environment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emotional development, and dealing reasonably with the difficult emotional circumstances that work inevitably throws up, isn’t just about special occasions or one-off moments of revelation. Our minds are leaky: we are continually forgetting things that &#8211; at our best moments &#8211; we know are important. We require regular topping up, a little nudge here and there to keep us on track. We’re not committed to bad habits, we just need reminders of the good ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So a good HR department sees it as its responsibility to foster a good EQ environment. It might send around emails about some of the main EQ difficulties which help us recognise them in ourselves and give encouragement in addressing them with others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it isn’t enough just to write essays or give lectures. The way something is said &#8211; the form the crucial reminders are delivered in &#8211; has to be sufficiently seductive to overcome resistance, compete for attention with a thousand emails and lodge themselves in our memories powerfully. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good EQ office might send around this sort of email, among many others:</span></p>

</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Direct Chat</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An EQ office has a culture of direct chats. It formalises these, so as to put them more forcibly on the agenda. It calls them <em>Direct Chats</em> or DCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great deal of trouble within teams, the lion’s share, comes from people not speaking honestly about their hopes, disappointments and frustrations. Things are bottled up, and then explode or seep noxiously through an office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are good reasons why most of us are so indirect in our modes of communication. Politically, it’s only been a few generations since we’ve enjoyed freedom and the ability to speak as we like. Inside though, we retain an inner serfdom. Moreover, many of our childhoods didn’t promote direct communication. We were small, vulnerable infants in the hands of large, powerful adults and we may not have dared, or known how, to speak up and clearly about our needs. Indirectness is a strategy in conditions of unequal power.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/15946263618_7ffb413b44_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6491" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/15946263618_7ffb413b44_z.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="15946263618_7ffb413b44_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most offices are filled with power inequalities which work against any capacity to communicate directly: What if I speak and they fire me? What if I speak and they resign? What if I speak, and they don’t buy? It can seem as if there are ample reasons always to lapse back into habits of indirectness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the EQ-committed office doesn’t accept this, it knows &#8211; perhaps from experience &#8211; how expensive indirectness always ends up being, and how much wisdom and good practice come to the fore when people dare to be direct.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it accords huge privilege to the practice of The Direct Chat. Any employee can at any point put in a request for A Direct Chat with any other, right across company hierarchies: the receptionist can request a DC with the boss, the middle manager in sales or the IT guy on the floor below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are strict rules around how a DC can go. Company videos show workers the format of a DC. There are three training sessions around this for every new employee. Crucially, there are responsibilities on both sides of the equation, the speaker and the listener. For example, the speaker can never directly accuse the listener. They cannot say, ‘You never listen to me in meetings.’ They have to say, ‘<em>You make me feel as if </em>you are not listening to me in meetings&#8230;’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3385144016_bffece6c44_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6495" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3385144016_bffece6c44_b.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3385144016_bffece6c44_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/smannion</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This avoids the suggestion that the speaker has deliberately meant to upset the listener. It leaves room for misunderstanding and for the idea that the speaker might be transfering an emotion from elsewhere. The tone cannot be accusatory. One can show upset, but no desire for vengeance; one can be sad but not furious. One cannot broaden the complaint exponentially (one cannot, as marriage counsellors say, ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the other).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the while, the listener has responsibilities. They cannot humiliate, they cannot deny that there is an issue, they have to accept the courage and authenticity behind the complaint. They have to listen patiently and never laugh cruelly. The other is taking a risk, like taking off their clothes, and one has to admire the courage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within a DC, all kinds of slightly unusual behaviour are entirely permitted. You can cry, you can be intense, emotion is allowed. This doesn’t get used against you. Most importantly, one moves on: one isn’t allowed to hold grudges from past DCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having DCs should be seen as a normal part of office life. If one doesn’t have at least five a year, something is very wrong and it counts against one. The culture of DCs signals that the office has left behind the age of feudalism and psychological humiliation; indirectness is not only emotionally unhelpful, it is far far too expensive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">EQ Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re all in possession of insights into the flaws of others, which are true and potentially very useful. You’ve noticed time and again how a particular colleague tries to press too much work onto others; it’s struck you that one of the people you collaborate with on a major project is so eager to please that you’re finding yourself discounting whatever they say. These people don’t set out to create problems around collaboration and in an ideal world these insights could get passed along to the relevant people in an unthreatening and useful way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3306671894_73998a6466_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3306671894_73998a6466_z.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="3306671894_73998a6466_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we almost never do share these with the person concerned. Because at the moment, there’s a real fear the person would take it the wrong way &#8211; as a cruel attack, rather than as an attempt to help. It would seem to leave one open to a reciprocal attack &#8211; which, again, feels too threatening. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Really, the only place where we buck this trend is in relationships; the rest of the time we are basically avoidant; we give up on people, suffer in silence or change jobs. This inefficiency costs everyone a lot. It’s a situation where a great deal of important information is in the ether, but it can’t be tapped into effectively because we lack the skill to do so. Not a technical skill. But the emotional skill of framing an issue in a way that doesn’t humiliate someone and that doesn’t make us come across as vindictive or mean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office can be the arena in which this omnipresent issue is addressed and solved &#8211; by developing the EQ Review. Everyone in the company needs to see an EQ Coach at least once a year. Management gives the EQ Coach a number of guidelines on how a particular individual is falling short in the ten areas of EQ immaturity. In more pressing cases (where someone is falling short in their work schedule or causing problems for other people) substantial EQ treatment can be delivered: each immaturity takes at least four one-hour sessions to treat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because there can be feedback from employee to employer in the course of the EQ Review the relationship between the coach and the company is &#8211; potentially &#8211; extremely valuable. It allows for the development of a deep understanding of what is going well &#8211; or not too well &#8211; in the relationship between management and employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s a field in which it is crucial &#8211; but extremely difficult &#8211; to get insight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/175019386.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6905" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/175019386.jpg?resize=635%2C393" alt="US-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PEACE-DIPLOMACY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Diplomacy arises when there’s too much tension between two parties for them to engage openly themselves. They get too upset or intimidated. And yet, there is a huge amount they could constructively share. The coach is a kind of diplomat &#8211; a go-between &#8211; and is the skilful and professional ambassador of vitally important knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For too long, sorting out psychological issues has been seen as a luxury, as something beneficial only to personal life. But this is an illusion we can no longer afford. Emotional maturity is no add-on to an effective business, it has to be at its core, it is quite simply the most valuable skill for any team of people as they pursue the big collective tasks of modern business.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Collaborating with other people is hard. Few of us are born knowing how to do it. Odd though it might sound, we have to learn, by conscious reflection, how to work successfully with others. And so we should take care to identify and occasionally nurture what one might term ‘the collaborative virtues’, the set of psychological traits on which good teamwork depends.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Modesty about Sanity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s desperately easy to settle into the view that it’s always other people’s fault: they are the peculiar, stupid, mean, lazy, judgemental ones. That may well be true, but it doesn’t make progress any easier. We need to start from a different, less self-righteous place. We need to keep clear in our minds all the very many shameful times when we have messed up, lost our tempers, failed to interpret situations correctly and acted vindictively and blindly. We should take on board with good grace the truth that we too are blockheads. Self-righteousness is the enemy of group work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of loosening our grip on self-righteousness means identifying one’s transferences: all the distinctive psychological patterns generated in childhood that one is bringing to situations in the present. We should strive to overcome our flaws through a patient, sympathetic understanding of our psychological histories and the warps they have created in our minds. Self-analysis is &#8211; in this context &#8211; not self-indulgent, it’s a social virtue. We will become much easier people to be around once we good-naturedly accept that we are all genuinely very difficult &#8211; and, in no pejorative sense, a little crazy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6907" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Others are Scared, Not Mean or Stupid</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When there is conflict, it’s painfully easy to run to the interpretation that those who are giving us trouble are nasty or bad. That isn’t a cheering realisation but it’s an oddly satisfying one nevertheless: it somehow settles our disappointments into safely depressive patterns and confirms an underlying suspicion that the world is peopled by idiots, an imputation for which there is always plenty of evidence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the truth is more complicated. Other people are rarely simply bad. What they are far more often is scared. They are behaving in desperately unhelpful ways because they are extremely anxious on some score. Though the raised voices and defensive tone look like signs of strength, no one </span>who is feeling strong ever actually behaves like this. The mature response should hence not be to increase the tension and flare up in return, but to strive to see that one has a hurt, flailing, lost person in front of one, to whom the correct response should be sympathy, calm and understanding. Let’s not always be so shallow as to get put off by the dispiriting externals. Let’s do our colleagues the honour of looking beyond the troublesome surface behaviour, to the frightened person within. It’s an art that every parent knows how to practice with a child in a tantrum and it is no insult to any adult to be treated, occasionally, as if they too were still somewhere inside them very young and deserving of the sympathy we naturally give to children. That’s what tolerance and love really mean &#8211; looking beyond the adult bluster to the fearful child within.</p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. The Art of Directness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both at a psychological and at a political level, we have backgrounds that have emphasised the art of indirectness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only a few generations back, almost all of us lived under deeply authoritarian regimes, where the priorities were keeping quiet and practicing subterfuge. Not speaking directly was a survival mechanism. You wouldn’t tell the king how you really felt: your insights were of no interest to the feudal lord. You learnt to keep very quiet around your tyrannical boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6454" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not an understanding ear: King Louis XIV of France</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, at the psychological level, every childhood is marked by vast differences in status between child and adult which often train us to hide what we experience. We start off as helpless infants exposed to the momentous power of adults. It isn’t easy to find one’s voice with someone who has a 30-year head start, apparently knows everything, controls the TV and computer and has a very strict view of who we are meant to be. The adults are meant to have our best interests at heart, but they may not always provide conditions in which we can freely express our needs without fear of retribution: they do not always offer lessons in the art of directness. Perhaps our caregivers needed us to be preternaturally ‘good’ or were excessively worried by signs of independence. It’s still remarkably rare to grow up in families where saying what you feel is seen as a virtue, rather than a troublesome trait best stamped out with discipline.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so we become experts in bottling up, in working around people, in not saying what we feel and what is ailing us; or in exploding in rage or settling into sulks rather than confidently letting out our issues in a deliberate, slow, convincing, mature way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our silences and defences come not from evil, but from a sense that our voice is illegitimate, because we are &#8211; somewhere inside &#8211; still serfs or infants. The enemy of good collaboration is an ingrained low self-esteem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To mature, we need to develop an adequate sense of self-love and resilience: we must feel that we have a right to exist, to be heard and to speak &#8211; and that we are strong enough to deal with what might happen if we were honest. We need a sense that we can survive the annoyance of another person. Indirectness is no sin, it’s a natural result of having been forced into patterns of subterfuge through early vulnerability. But we are now adults, people who can survive blows or move on if they prove intolerable. We are no longer cowed five-year-olds, desperate lest an adult withdraw their support. We have options. We can work on improving our impression of our own survivability. We can endure the risk of being disliked &#8211; in the name of a cleansing confrontation. We should go through mental exercises to practice inner resilience:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; I may be sacked, but I will find another job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; They may not like me here, but there will be other places which will respond more favourably.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; What I feel is not always bad or strange: it can deserve to be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to tell ourselves helpful, important things that we failed to hear from others sufficiently loudly early on:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; You’re going to be OK, whatever happens next.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; I will love you even if…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enough of stalking the earth with our shoulders hunched and our eyes wary. We have nothing to be ashamed of. We must channel a voice of confidence at moments when it will be submerged, through tiredness and fear, by the voices of the past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. The Weaknesses of Strengths</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other people are often so disappointing, it’s easy to lock on to their faults and simply wonder again and again why they are the way they are. Why are they so slow? Why are they so unreliable? How can they be so bad at confrontation? Why can’t they break bad news? Why are they so shifty? Do they have to be so defensive?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Circling the faults like this has a superficial self-righteous appeal, but it doesn’t begin to address the real issue. There is one giant alternative, a theory we call the Weaknesses of Strengths (WoS for short).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3199748827_9fe4204260_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6478" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3199748827_9fe4204260_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3199748827_9fe4204260_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Ludovic Bertron</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The theory goes like this: every strength that an individual has necessarily brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Though our minds tend to hive off the strengths and see these as essential, while deeming the weaknesses as a freakish add-on, in truth, the weaknesses are part and parcel of the strengths. We have the wrong picture of what a virtue is; there is no such thing in isolation, it will always be a virtue-vice. So the virtue of thoroughness is always going to bring with, in other contexts, the problem of pedantry; creative brilliance is going to be inseparable from logistical unreliability; people who are fantastic leaders at work are likely to be seriously difficult around domestic chores.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason for keeping this in mind is that we often encounter people&#8217;s weaknesses at moments when we’re in danger of losing sight of their strengths. At certain points, all it seems we’re bumping into are the weaknesses. We wonder: how did I end up in this relationship, hiring this person, joining this group of colleagues? During tough times, we remember only the flaws. We irritably notice just the pedantic way X chews their food, or Y’s maddening habit of announcing a grand scheme then never following up on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are failing to step back enough and ask the really vital question: not just what are these people’s weaknesses, but what are the strengths of which these pretty annoying traits are the unfortunate shadow sides?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should remember that there are no ideal candidates out there &#8211; and may hence be a little more cautious about walking out on a relationship or calling an end to an employment contract. We may well find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses to introduce us to in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to overcome an unhelpful belief in a theoretical unity of virtues, in the possibility that anyone could be at once loyal and edgy, thorough and fizzing with creative energy; authoritative and pliant. All the virtues cannot coexist &#8211; every virtue has a weakness that will negate or contradict other virtues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is, incidentally, why people need teams: of 2 or 5 or 100. We need teams because all the virtues don’t coexist and need to be counterbalanced. A team is a union of strengths and a compensation for individual weaknesses. If one could possess all the virtues, there’d simply be no reason ever to live with someone else or join an office. The necessary price for our reliance on strengths is having to endure certain weaknesses too. We haven’t been uniquely cursed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 1870s, when he was living in Paris, the American novelist Henry James became a good friend of the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who was also living in the city at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image07.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6455" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image07.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ivan Turgenev: great at writing, appalling at punctuality.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Henry James was particularly taken by the unhurried, tranquil style of the Russian’s storytelling. He obviously took a long time over every sentence, weighing different options, changing, polishing, until &#8211; at last &#8211; everything was perfect. It was an ambitious, inspiring approach to writing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in personal and social life these same virtues could make Turgenev a maddening companion. He’d accept an invitation to lunch; then &#8211; the day before &#8211; send a note explaining that he would not be able to attend; then another saying how much he looked forward to the occasion. Then he would turn up &#8211; two hours late. Arranging anything with him was a nightmare. Yet his social waywardness was really just the same thing that made him so attractive as a writer. It was the same unwillingness to hurry; the same desire to keep the options open until the last moment. This produced marvellous books &#8211; <strong><em>and</em></strong> dinner party chaos. In reflecting on Turgenev’s character, Henry James reflected that his Russian friend was exhibiting the ‘weakness of his strength.’</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/720px-Henry_James_by_John_Singer_Sargent_cleaned-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6479" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/720px-Henry_James_by_John_Singer_Sargent_cleaned-1.jpg?resize=635%2C526" alt="720px-Henry_James_by_John_Singer_Sargent_cleaned (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we’re collaborating we’re often exposed to the downside of people’s positive capacities. Every virtue has an associated weakness. The person who is extremely methodical and can be relied upon to spot tiny (but highly consequential) errors early on is invaluable. They can go through a document with a toothcomb. But maybe to be like that they also have to have a certain dimming of the imagination, a tendency to be less adventurous in conversation and see life mainly in quantitative terms. They might not be your ideal companion on holiday or the person you’d turn to to unburden your troubled soul. But that’s bearable when these are seen as consistent with their valuable strengths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person. The person who is really adventurous around ideas, who doesn’t get intimidated by the power of ‘how we’ve always done things’ &#8211; is very unlikely to also be able to have the virtues of modesty and calm. They are quite likely to get carried away at times. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should be ready for this &#8211; and never lose sight of a strength, at moments when the weakness is only too painfully apparent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gratitude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collaboration should be founded on recognition that there are bigger tasks we believe in but cannot accomplish on our own. And not merely in the sense that we don’t have enough time to do it all ourselves. But more profoundly in the sense that we ourselves lack some of the necessary aptitudes and skills for an important project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a natural temptation of the soloist: we may assume that the most prominent skill is the only one that really counts &#8211; and so not much appreciate the less conspicuous contributions of other people &#8211; although those background contributions really are necessary, and without them the star efforts would be much less effective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gratitude develops in tandem with humility. If you’re ready to admit that you can’t do something well enough (though it does need to be done) then you are developing an appreciation of people who have the relevant ability, even if it is in a less prestigious area than your own. Instead of just envying them &#8211; and quietly wishing they would go away or make some big mistake &#8211; one is relieved that someone has the needed skill. This kind of gratitude means you don’t necessarily have to like a person to be glad to be working with them.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gratitude involves acknowledging dependence: it means recognising that one really needs the contributions of others. And it can be genuinely frightening to admit that a crucial outcome (which is very important to one’s own ambitions) is significantly in the hands of colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So, the successful collaborator is someone who is able to live with the anxiety of dependence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic reason one gives up on collaboration (or goes through the motions, with limited enthusiasm) is a lack of faith in education, a lack of sincere belief that people can change. You look at your colleagues &#8211; at the people you are going to be collaborating with &#8211; and just know all the difficulties. That one is so slow, the other one is so narcissistic, a third is so cautious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good collaborator isn’t always too worried about this, because they have a theory of change. The fact that their colleagues don’t understand something or have settled into some unfortunate ways doesn’t seem to them like a disaster. The good collaborator has a measure of reasonable faith that better practices and ideas can be made convincing, if introduced with tack and energy. They have faith in the general human capacity to learn (which everyone has exercised to a very great extent at many points in their lives, even if they’ve given up on it at the moment). They are not particularly daunted by the ignorance of others, nor indeed are they dismayed by their own current inabilities. They are believers in education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Strategic Pessimism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strategic pessimism is different from despair. It’s a limited, conscious attempt to reign in expectations when these are causing particular difficulties. In reality, we will have to spend time alongside and engaged with people who we find problematic and yet cannot, for a range of reasons, confront honestly and attempt to resolve differences with. Our options can feel desperately limited. We can’t get rid of them, we can’t make them different and we don’t want to just walk out the door ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So all that’s left is learning how to live &#8211; and interact and collaborate &#8211; with people who we don’t intuitively like or who have some marked problems with. Living in a dignified way with things we don’t like but can’t change was one of the central challenges that a group of ancient philosophers &#8211; named the Stoics &#8211; devoted their lives to exploring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for some 400 years in Ancient Greece and Rome, gaining widespread support among all classes of society. It had one overwhelming and highly practical ambition: teaching people how to endure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We still honour this school whenever we call someone ‘stoic’ or plain ‘philosophical’ when fate turns against them: when they lose their keys, are humiliated at work, rejected in love or disgraced in society. Of all philosophies, Stoicism remains perhaps the most immediately relevant and useful for moments of office life.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman Stoic Seneca: the patron saint of challenging meetings.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contrary to an optimistic mindset that thinks every problem can (with sufficient ingenuity and effort) be put right, the Stoics embraced the idea that there are numerous problems we can’t solve but can nevertheless accommodate ourselves to with grace. They took the view that if we try to solve them, and keep on stoking our hopes that they will get solved and put right, we make ourselves very miserable, because we’re always feeling immensely frustrated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoics were deeply moved by contemplation of what for them was an everyday sight &#8211; a dog being yanked along behind a cart at the end of a rope. The dog is going to have to follow the cart of course: there’s nothing it can do about that; but all the time it fights against the inevitable; it strains and gets agitated and tries to rush off to either side or hold back. It’s an image of immense, but futile, agitation. And it reminded the Stoics of … human beings. From the dog example, they drew an important moral. When the dog gives up trying to follow its own path and simply trots behind the cart, it is much less pained. A key Stoic idea is that we need to make a similar kind of move to live more comfortably with problems that we can’t change in our own lives: we must trot along obediently behind the cart of our difficult colleagues. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoic move is to assume from the start that it is normal and natural for things to go quite badly sometimes. Of course, other people generally are very annoying in some ways. Obviously, collaboration is going to be quite hard. It’s normal to find working with others very difficult. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By presenting problems of collaboration as standard some of the heat is taken out of the situation. We no longer feel that we’re uniquely cursed with insufferable colleagues; we get a little less drawn to the fantasy of how great things might be if only we worked somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Forgiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It may not be a term we’re especially used to deploying in the work place. But it signals a crucial shift in attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Typically, we are acutely aware of other peoples’ symptoms and are drawn to demonising. We think of the bothersome individual as<em> deliberately</em> being like that, as having on purpose made themselves as they are. We don’t just find them annoying, we blame them. It stokes our resentment. we imagine that at every moment of their existence they have opted to have been self-aggrandising, or lazy, or unwilling to take any responsibility when things go wrong. It’s a way of thinking about them that hardens our resentment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forgiveness is tied up with the thought that <em>it’s possible for any decent person to end up in a very unfortunate place</em>. It encourages explanations of how a person who is otherwise quite sensitive, and normally well-intentioned, honourable and decent can end up being defensive, grumpy or sly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We realise that people come to be this way not because they got a strange positive desire to be like that, but because quite bad and difficult things have happened to them, and in response (as a way of surviving) they’ve developed a set of unattractive characteristics.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Emma Bovary: How good people can end up doing bad things.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 19th century France, the idea of a married woman having an affair was regarded &#8211; officially and in respectable circles at least &#8211; with horror. A fallen woman had no right to sympathy; she must be without any decent feelings. In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, the great-hearted novelist Gustave Flaubert tells the story of how an intelligent, imaginative and serious woman could end up married to one man and in bed with another. He redirects the reader’s response. Emma Bovary is no longer someone to be condemned and treated as an outcast. Flaubert doesn’t pretend that her affair is fine (the novel has a bleak ending). But he does transform the idea of the kind of woman who might end up in this situation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling that one is oneself troubled or defective in some ways &#8211; even if not the <em>same</em> ways as the people who annoy you &#8211; is a crucial move towards a measure of forgiveness. It points up the general thought: it’s not just this person. They may be unlike us in the particular way in which they are irritating and difficult &#8211; but not in the simple fact of being difficult and irritating: that’s common ground &#8211; if only we can bring ourselves to admit it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key question is to ask: ‘despite the surface differences, have I ever done anything similar&#8230;’: have I ever wished another person to fail, out of spite? Have I ever felt that a task was beneath my dignity? Have I ever wished I could go behind people’s backs and not have to bother with persuading them?’ The point of a forgiving attitude isn’t to say that this kind of conduct is just fine and doesn’t matter. We know it matters. What it does is adjust our view of the person who is misbehaving. It turns them from a demon into someone quite normal, someone a bit like us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Acceptable Tensions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we are trying to picture the kind of office where there’s lots of fruitful collaboration going on, we might imagine everyone getting on well; meetings with lots of agreement and shared insights. We tend to associate collaboration with harmony. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s another possibility &#8211; one that was most notably explored by the German philosopher Hegel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6459" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image21.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="image21" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Hegel’s famous book, <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, he traces the way that the views of ambitious and intelligent people have changed over time. At one point, the most sophisticated and serious people thought that it was extremely important to be devoted to your family and your group. They saw loyalty as one of the most important of human qualities. Then opinion shifted. People came to distrust groups, the idea was that it was most important to be an individual, to find your own voice and develop your own unique point of view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These outlooks are pretty much diametrically opposed. And Hegel was reluctant to say that one was obviously better than the other. Rather, he suggested they are both ‘true’ &#8211; that is each hits upon something important. So, ideally we’d be able to extract the bit of the truth that each side possesses and find a way of holding them together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel believed that the way in which this happens &#8211; in which separated bits of insight get joined together &#8211; is not especially peaceful. It’s the good result of conflict. When people conflict well they bring their deepest, most important insights to the surface; by having to defend them against intelligent criticism they find better, more powerful ways of expressing their ideas. Hegel encourages us not to get too alarmed by the clash of ideas. The ideal collaboration &#8211; in his view &#8211; involves tension, profound disagreements and conflicts in outlook and ambition. Hegel gave good conflict a special name: he called it a ‘dialectic’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspired by Hegel, the<em> dialectical</em> office might incubate divergent micro-cultures. There would be an expectation of squabbling, of opposition and disagreement &#8211; in the conviction that, ideally, it is from such tensions that the really valuable insights do finally emerge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">&#8216;Good Enough’ Company</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because commerce really is competitive, and because mistakes are at times harshly punished by the market, work can easily tap into our latent fear of imperfection. We come to feel that we have to get everything right, that any mistake is going to lead to disaster. It’s a feeling that intensifies the anxieties around collaboration. One’s mediocre, awkward or difficult colleagues are surely going to bring the whole business down. The feeling grows that it’s necessary to battle them every day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, however, that many imperfect things survive and even flourish in the world. A remarkable number of things can go wrong, and do go wrong, and things muddle along anyhow. The individual and a nation can survive an awful lot of mistakes, perhaps as many as 40% of decisions can go very wrong, and still we’ll get through. There is a number above which things get genuinely dangerous, but it’s perhaps a lot lot higher than we might assume in our more panic stricken moments &#8211; as we contemplate the idiocies of politicians or our colleagues. This is what it means to have a resilient attitude: it’s a knowledge that the ship can have a lot of leaks in it and still stay afloat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was an English paediatrician, who early on in his career became passionate about the then new field of psychoanalysis. He was analysed by James Strachey, who had translated Freud into English, and became Britain’s first medically-trained child psychoanalyst. He worked as a consultant in children’s medicine at the Paddington Green Children’s Hospital in London, and also played a crucial role in public education around child-rearing, delivering some 600 talks on the BBC, tirelessly lecturing around the country and authoring 15 books, among which the bestselling <em>Home is Where We Start From</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image15.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6460" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image15.jpg?resize=635%2C403" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott wanted to help people to be, in his famous formulation, ‘good enough’ parents; not brilliant or perfect ones (as ambitious people naturally might have wished), but just OK. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was aware that new parents are often very panicked by the slightest mistake. They worry to an extraordinary degree if they miss a feed, or if the child isn’t reading exactly when the books say they should be or if there are quite a lot of tantrums. His tone is always reassuring. He tells his audiences that no one is perfect, all one needs to aim for is to be ‘good enough’, that every child’s upbringing has enormous tensions in it, that a bit of madness belongs to sanity, that feeling lost is a part of finding one’s way &#8211; and a dozen more lessons of comparable simplicity and down-beat essential wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6911" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Matteo Bagnoli</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The move Winnicott made around parenting wasn’t designed to let sloppy, negligent, indifferent people feel great about themselves. Winnicott was trying to help the normal kind of person who is already quite conscientious and committed but who is in danger of getting very frustrated with themselves and others because they think it’s absolutely essentially to get everything right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such worries don’t only exist around the nursery. At work too, we may get so taken up with our ideals that we grow unnecessarily angry and panicked around our colleagues and the normal wear and tear of office life. It is completely normal to want everything to be perfect. But the only long-term solution is to reconcile oneself to the omnipresence of error &#8211; and to settle instead on the workable ideal of belonging to a ‘good enough company.’</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Although collaboration – the extraordinary business of having to work with other people – is one of the major facts of modern life, it remains strangely unstudied and undiscussed as a formal topic. Our culture does not typically invite us to pay close and admiring attention to successful collaborative efforts, nor to immerse ourselves in learning the lessons from painful, failed joint ventures.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are – without being much aware of it – guided by a strong Romantic prejudice in favour of lone creators. This is where we focus our attention and derive our models of work from. The largest stories we tell ourselves about creating things concern artists, isolated actors who operate without relying on anyone other than themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6405" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr.jpeg?resize=635%2C598" alt="Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Vincent Van Gogh, <em>Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear </em>(1889)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One person painted this canvas yet and there are – at this moment – 4,876 books about the man. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re much less familiar, and much less culturally appreciative, of the kind of labours that went into creating things like the Jean-Luc Lagardère assembly plant at Toulouse-Blagnac in south-western France, where the Airbus 380 is put together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/L-Bob-150.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6406" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/L-Bob-150.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="L-Bob (150)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8,000 people were involved in making the hangar and assembly line, but we generally don’t know anything at all about their lives or labours. We don’t have burned into our imaginations stirring tales of the key meetings at which a group of senior executives took the major decision to focus final production in Toulouse rather than Hamburg or Filton; nor of the late night meetings at which specialists in wing design got together with the people who were in charge of the landing gear to make sure that their scheduling needs would be catered for within the new facility. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet this neglect of collaboration is no inconsequential matter. Some failures around collaboration are due to <em><strong>procedural and practical problems</strong></em>. For example: meetings are scheduled at inconvenient times, the layout of a room doesn’t facilitate interaction, the management architecture of a corporation means that people in different departments find it really hard to understand one another; the email system doesn’t allow for group discussions&#8230; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At The School of Life [the parent company of The Book of Life], our focus is slightly different. We’re interested in the <strong><em>psychological problems</em></strong> that get in the way of good collaboration. Our goal is to understand how organisations trip up even when the technology is in place, the architecture is pleasing and the staff have all the right qualifications on paper – because everyone is bringing what might be called ‘problems of character’ into the office with them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The root cause of a lot of difficulties in collaboration is nothing less than emotional. Emotional issues are not an incidental aspect of modern business; they are not a vague phenomenon that one might chose to worry about only when all other issues have been solved. No ambitious business can afford to ignore the momentous goal of improving levels of emotional maturity.</span></p>

<p class="p1">It’s an agreed part of joining any modern office that we quite quickly get to know the quirks of people around us. Because many of these quirks are weird and distressing, we often feel an urge to chat about them with others, perhaps in the coffee shop around the corner from the office. This activity is sometimes dismissed as mere ‘gossip,’ but something important is going on when we air views on, for example, the manner of the guy in sales or the notorious temper of the IT chief. We are chatting because we are frightened and upset and want to air our puzzlement at how others behave. We gossip in order to release tension – and because collaboration is so hard.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Office gossip tends to feel extremely individual (it’s all about Megan or Dave or Ida), but if one takes a step back, all the endless permutations of complaint we have about people tend to boil down to some core flaws that keep recurring in people. There are, in our eyes, ten problematic character traits in people that make office life so hard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">                                            Ten Anti-Collaboration Traits</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensiveness is an a priori need to reject criticism. It raises the cost of disagreement hugely, for whenever a defensive person meets with anything, however small, which is negative about themselves and their behaviour, their response is both very large and extremely severe. This is because, inside themselves, they take the attack to be entirely personal and therefore catastrophic. There is in their minds no distinction between a criticism of their work – and a criticism of their very being and right to exist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It becomes deeply depressing to have any sort of tricky discussion with them about anything. It’s guaranteed to flare up. One wants to point out that something is a little late; but is there really a point when a drama is going to ensue? Organisations can put up with defensive people for a long time, but the relationship tends to get more and more joyless – and eventually, no one is too sad when a decision is taken to part ways.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Irrational Rivalry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rivalry can be very beneficial: for example, when you have two sales teams seeking the best quarterly results; two research groups pursuing different strategies to solve a major problem; or many analysts competing to provide the most accurate and most useful overview of an issue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are individuals who bring rivalry into areas that don’t require it – and certainly don’t benefit from it. For example, a busy executive is assigned a smart young assistant to take some of the less complex issues off their desk. But instead of making the best use of this help and streamlining their own efforts, the executive starts to worry that their assistant is doing too well; they think (incorrectly) that if the assistant is a success, their own job will soon disappear. So they start to make life difficult for them. They get reluctant to pass on tasks and they get extremely agitated the day their assistant is praised by the CEO. They would rather some of their work was done badly, or not at all, than that their helper should do it well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels as if there is only space for one of them to thrive and they are in competition for the limited affection of a superior. This is the definition of irrational rivalry: rivalry with no sane productive business end.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: People-Pleasing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People-pleasing means a manic terror of passing on information, however important, that might upset others. It is deeply problematic, for it confuses being polite with withholding information. It blurs the line between lying and pleasing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Successful nations and businesses are never sentimental around bad news: they are founded on the principle of the free flow of the most awkward bits of information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Negativity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The negative person knows things are going to go wrong. They’ve been there before – and can’t resist pointing out drawbacks and dangers. In their mind, being negative is the way to be wise: it means seeing through the foolish delusions and naive hopes of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Collaborating with them is hard: they kill ideas very early.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Negativity belongs to a mindset that might rudely be called inner feudalism.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some part of their brains, the guys doing the threshing know that big decisions are taken all the time, castles get built, people rise to power and courage make fortunes. But in their own lives, none of these feats seem remotely possible. They have been inculcated with the view that no improvements are likely, everything will stay the same and if you try to improve things you’ll get into trouble and it will all go wrong anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outwardly the age of feudalism is long, long gone. But inwardly, some of its characteristics remain even in a time of democracy, freedom and laptop computers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Bluster</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first they can seem rather exciting to work with. They like throwing out big ideas, and are great at sketching exciting scenarios about how everything might work out. But there’s a snag. Their optimism is excessive &#8211; and compulsive. They refuse to consider the downsides seriously, even when something is inherently rocky. They regard anxiety about possible bad outcomes as a sign of weakness. They won’t take risks seriously. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are very difficult to collaborate with because they tend to be impatient with detail, which they regard as unimportant. They see concern with specifics as ‘fussy’, hardly worth bothering about. It’s as if, at some point, they had been over-exposed to a very unhelpful picture of what it means to focus on details. They suffered at the hands of someone a bit too plodding and unimpressive, someone genuinely pedantic and nit picking. And now lots of things that are actually very important are seen by them as mere ‘fussing&#8230;’. They are perhaps in flight from an over-protective, over-cautious mother.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charles Dickens’ character Mr. Micawber (from the novel <em>David Copperfield</em>) is full of bluster and ill-grounded optimism. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He always believes that ‘something will turn up’ and has a remarkable ability to fail to learn anything from his past troubles. The difficulty is that moment by moment he appears confident and reasonable. He talks well (in general terms) about the opportunities and all the projects he has on the go. It can take some time before one realises that this person’s confidence is not in fact well-grounded &#8211; and is in fact highly dangerous to the whole team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Over-Control</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The control-freak has a horror of letting other people do things. No matter how pressed for time or overburdened they might be, they are very reluctant to let any decisions or tasks leave their desk. Sharing and delegating causes them real anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Control is often a virtue. It means taking responsibility for getting something right; it’s the conviction that certain tasks are worth a lot of personal effort. But in patterns of over-control, other people are always seen as obstacles to doing things well. They are just a bunch of idiots, somehow in the way of getting to a good result.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Secret Manoeuvring</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret manoeuvring is a pattern of behaviour whereby one quickly gives up on the people one is meant to be collaborating with, fails to talk to them about one’s disappointments &#8211; and instead works around them with the help of a few select not-always-officially-sanctioned colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A secret manoeuvrer may seem supportive; and may appear to have taken a suggestion quite positively. In the meeting, they didn’t raise any objection. They gave you a big smile. They sent you a message saying they thought your idea was very interesting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What you don’t realise yet is that behind the scenes, they have a very different attitude. This is a person who is determined to get their way. But they don’t want to risk stating their intentions openly. They very much dislike confrontations and show downs. Even acknowledging disagreement can be quite upsetting to them. However, they are not at all passive or willing just to put up with things they don’t like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They just hate conflict a lot and despair of others very fast. They worry that if they have to convince everyone, nothing will get achieved. They are pessimistic about communication. So they go intently to work &#8211; only you won’t see what they are up to. They hate the idea of keeping people informed. They set up secret side groups. It’s meant to be a collaboration between 20 equals. But they go out and hire two external consultants who they set up alongside the 20 that are meant to be doing the job. Secret manoeuvrers are constantly quickly losing faith with the people they’re meant to be working with, and briefing against their intended collaborators behind their backs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6916" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all sounds dark and Machiavellian &#8211; but it’s important to realise where the secret manoeuvring is coming from. It’s the outcome of a deeply ambitious personality that has very low faith in others and in their own ability to work through a problem with someone. In their personal life, the secret manoeuvrer may well have a lover and a spouse: they’re disappointed with the partner they married, but they haven’t come around to expressing what they really feel. It seemed better to steer around the conflict and start up a new relationship on the side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re doing in business a version of what they’re doing in their marriage. They’re devoting themselves to ‘lovers’ because they can’t tolerate the tensions and ambiguities of sticking with the group they’ve originally pledged themselves to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Unfriendliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are people at work who don’t do ‘nice’. They quickly let you know that they don’t waste their time on (as they see it) the minor niceties of massaging people’s egoes, giving out the occasional words of encouragement, smiling or asking about how the holidays went.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are markedly abrupt. They tell you straight out they didn’t much like your ideas. They thought your section of the report was poorly presented &#8211; and weakly argued. They never seem to sugar-coat bad news. They won’t soften the blow. They are almost impossible to impress. And their demeanour suggests they really don’t think your approval is worth having in the first place. They tend to regard more gentle behaviour as a mere disguise for inefficiency. They bring the mood down. They don’t stoke enthusiasm. They are cynical about rousing speeches. They feel they have to be mean to win. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: Slyness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the table, looking perhaps rather dapper or elegantly turned out, there’s one member of the team who seems not quite to regard things as serious. They can be very charming and good company (for a while). But they give the impression they are just ‘holidaying’ at the company; or that they are working for ‘fun’ rather than because they really have to. In some way their reasons for being here are not like those of others. Some large part of their life, which they hint at but don’t fully describe, is more important than what is going on in the room. Maybe they are about to inherit a fortune, maybe in their bedroom they designed an app which is about to go global, maybe a relative owns the whole corporation and they’re working incognito to get a feel for the various departments before taking over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are quietly superior. They don’t seem to care a great deal how things turn out. Their contributions make people laugh, or lighten the mood &#8211; but they don’t really seem to grapple with the issues. And somehow they never seem to end up doing the more grinding tasks. They often have to head off to a lunch; their use of the expense account is technically right but somehow wrong in spirit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At an industry reception, you notice them chatting in a very chummy way to a senior person in a rival firm. You’d not be surprised if they were saying some rather mean things about their colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a pain collaborating with them because you never quite feel they are making a full effort. They give the impression the group isn’t good enough for them. They are special, while the rest of us &#8211; sadly &#8211; are not. Sly superiority can be grounded in injured narcissism. It’s a desperate, and fragile response to a nagging insecurity about just joining in and admitting that this is your gang &#8211; for better and for worse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ten: Non-Listening</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re speaking they nod; they might make an occasional note; they look at you. They go through the externals of listening. But actually, they are not paying attention to what you say. In their head they already feel they know the key things. They are just politely allowing you to ventilate. But your words cannot actually be important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variant on non-listening is to speak too much; it’s grounded in the same lack of curiosity about what other people think. The person who speaks too much isn’t merely hogging the conversation. They are in fact demonstrating they they are not a good listener. In their mind, listening is the inferior position, speaking is the sign of status. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not surprising that listening isn’t done so well very often: we have some very powerful collective conceptions of the power of speechifying.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">                                           BETTER COLLABORATION</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s normal, when we think about the problems at work, to think first and foremost about that highly troublesome category: <em>other people</em>. Their flaws are so obvious, so irritating, so hurtful…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can therefore take a long while &#8211; but this is no sign of evil on our part &#8211; before we realise that, logically-speaking, the faults cannot merely belong to others. Slowly, a realisation dawns: we must by necessity have flaws of our own when it comes to working with others. That’s when we should start to ask some key questions: what do we think we are like to work with? What makes us troublesome? What might people be saying about us when a gossip session happens out of earshot?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are deeply tricky questions. Our self-love, that coating of protection we need in order to drag ourselves through life, generally resists such unpeeling. And yet, we would be wise to go in for enquiries of this sort, because we’re always likely to be one part of what makes any collaborative activity go well or badly. Furthermore, we have unique access to ourselves. We don’t have to ask anyone permission or worry about issues of seniority. We can start right away &#8211; and feed back to ourselves without fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But to begin the process, we have to relax, which means legitimating the idea that everyone, and that includes us, is a little crazy and damaged. And that’s very much OK. Our madness and eccentricity is a given, and no sign of pathology. Of course we’re hard to work with and quite tricky. We’re human. The issue isn’t whether or not we have problems. It’s just a case of determining which ones we have &#8211; and then trying to do something, ever so modest, about improving them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What flaws do you think you have…?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Take the list of the 10 immaturities and grade yourself against them from 0 to 10.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Whenever you go over a five, stop and reflect.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Then tell us/yourself a story about when you were immature in collaborating… &#8211; and what happened.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Where did the difficulty come from in your character? What were you scared about? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">How does your immaturity relate to your past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Theory of Transference</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes each of us hard to work with is that we carry certain rather unhelpful ideas around with us about what other people are going to be like, how they will behave towards us, and what will happen when we say and do a variety of things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all have a ‘history’ that unbalances our responses to the presence. It heavily predisposes us to interpret current reality in certain ways, and to twist the evidence according to a narrative that feels familiar &#8211; but may be deeply unproductive for everyone concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task of emotional maturity at the office means getting on top of one’s history, realising the exaggerated dynamics one is bringing to situations and monitoring oneself more accurately and more critically so as to improve one’s capacity to judge and act on situations more neutrally and sensibly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The origins of our distorted behaviour patterns lie in something known as<em> transference</em> – a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature – that we cobbled together in our past, in childhood to meet a threat that we were at that time too vulnerable, immature and inexperienced to cope with properly. We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to the difficulties of adulthood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy – and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is even distantly evocative of our earlier troubles. Perhaps we had chaotic, unreliable parents whom we dealt with by rigidly organising our room, arranging books by size, and reacting with alarm at the slightest bit of dust – and even now, outer disorder ushers in a panicky feeling within that everything is out of control once again. Or we had a sister who was always late to events that mattered to us, or a mother who was both humiliating and obsessed by fashion.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The outer world is constantly putting in front of us situations that are relatively ambiguous and look quite a lot like ones from the past. Unfortunately, the unconscious mind is very bad at distinguishing the present from the past, and reality from ambiguity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because transference happens without us knowing it, we generally can’t explain why we are behaving as we are. We carry years behind us that have no discernible shape, which we have forgotten about and which we aren’t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We just come across as a bit weird or extreme in certain areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Key to building up emotional maturity is working out where transference might be occurring. To do this, we have to ask ourselves a lot of questions, in private, or perhaps with the help of a coach or therapist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can get a sense of the weight of the past on the present by considering ‘transference exercises.’ The most famous of these is the Rorschach test, devised in the 1930s by the psychologist Hermann Rorschach to help people to learn more about the contents of the hard-to-reach parts of their own minds. By being shown an ambiguous image and asked to say what it was, Rorschach believed that we would naturally reveal some of our latent guiding fears, hopes, prejudices and assumptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The important point in any Rorschach test is that the image has no one true meaning. Different people merely see different things in it according to what their past predisposes them to imagine. To one individual with a rather kindly and forgiving conscience, the image below could be seen as a sweet mask, with eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks. Another, more traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6415" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take another classic transference exercise:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6416" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image06.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s key that this image is ambiguous. You can read it many different ways, and that’s the point: to make you aware of your characteristic instances of transference by teasing them out with an inconclusive image.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of this image, people might say things like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or: I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing we do know – really – is that the picture doesn’t show any of these things, it simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it. And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. This is what one means by transference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A third transference exercise asks us to say the first thing that comes to mind when we try to finish certain sentences. For example:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Men are generally…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Women are almost always…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. When I fall in love, what’s bound to happen is…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. When someone I care about is late, it must be because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. The kitchen is in chaos, and it’s evidence that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. When I hear someone described as ‘very intellectual’, I imagine them being…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because these sentences aren’t about a concrete situation in the present, the only way to answer them is by calling up transferences from the past. Our responses hence give us a clue as to a bias in our minds that would normally be invisibly applied, merging imperceptibly with the dilemmas of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mature people are ready to accept that they might be involved in multiple transferences. Ideally, we should all rationally disentangle and un-distort our transferences and explain them to others in good time. But it rarely happens and collectively we pay a big price for our ignorance. We keep making things tough for everyone by over- and under-reacting – and so our work relationships are far harder than they need to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider the key areas of professional psychological distortion &#8211; and try to suggest some questions and exercises that can get us thinking more fruitfully about why we react the way we do:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensiveness tends to be the result of having internalised the voices of people in our past who judged us very severely and left us feeling not just that we did this or that problematic thing but far more catastrophically: that we might have been purely and simply ‘bad’. For the defensive among us, it doesn’t take much to be reminded of our proclivities to feel attacked. The slightest complaint can take us back to the original trauma. It’s therefore key to try to trace back the critical wound to its source &#8211; so as to develop a capacity to separate what belongs to the past from the give and take of office life today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image01.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6417" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image01.jpg?resize=514%2C491" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Berthe Morisot, <em>Le berceau</em> (1872)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However robust we may appear to others as adults, we all have a profound history of vulnerability. A baby is so small and delicate (though it can scream its head off if it doesn’t get fed), it’s worth pondering on its basic helplessness &#8211; and feeling a moment of compassion towards it and ourselves. We were all once hugely dependent on other people for our needs: we couldn’t speak or explain what we wanted, we had to rely on them to understand us, soothe us and be kind to us&#8230; Some of us enjoyed the touching care evoked by the painting above by Berthe Morisot  &#8211; minus the mosquito net over the bassinet, perhaps. Some of us were not so lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not surprising, therefore, if those among us who weren’t quite so carefully nurtured sometimes get a little extreme in our responses to attack, if we become &#8211; as the phrase goes &#8211; a bit defensive. There were once so many ways we could get seriously hurt and we had to develop some ways of defending ourselves as best we could. Our minds had to get used to being on high alert, always on battle stations, waiting for the next attack to come over the horizon. Anyone could have been the enemy. This becomes a plausible stance when you’ve been let down by someone you should have been able to rely on absolutely. It’s not surprising if, in adult life, some of us find we’ve built up a set of habits somewhat out of proportion with the threats we actually face, if we bridle at the first hint of criticism &#8211; not because we are bad,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but because it feels like this is the start of major assault and we would be running an intolerable risk were we not to strike back immediately. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The habits have become rather a liability now, of course. People get upset with defensive behaviour, and promotions aren’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>handed out so readily to those who, at the first hint of criticism, flare up, but we didn’t get<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>like this without some good reasons &#8211; reasons which we should (in calm moments) strive to trace back to their origins, fully understand and gently try to overcome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In the past, did you receive the support you needed?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Who let you down?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How and when?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did a person’s criticism ever help you solve a problem? </span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To recognise &#8211; without shame &#8211; and understand sympathetically, why one has become defensive is the key to unwinding the habits of excessive self-protection. We need to see that we’re warding off dangers that were experienced as very real in the past, but which don’t actually threaten us anything like so much today. We needed those defences once. Now we can afford to let them go. We’re truly strong, strong enough not to need to greet the world with armour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider this little School of Life film, which lightly sends up the difficulties associated with being over-defensive.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Irrational Rivalry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Early on, there must somehow have been a feeling that there wasn’t enough love to go around. So we learned to compete, and to worry about anyone else who might be in a position to hog the attention more properly due to us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">-  Who was a difficult rival for you early on?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whose attention or approval were you competing for? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How did it feel when you thought you were being rejected, overlooked or sidelined? How did you react? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- From the perspective of today, how do you think that person really saw you &#8211; and how did they see your rival?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Was there anything that could have reassured you at the time? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, perhaps consider this picture by<em> Pierre Prud’hon: Portrait of Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck and Family</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image22.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6418" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image22.jpg?resize=543%2C541" alt="image22" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They all look kind, charming and reasonable. But imagine that the children are in the grip of irrational rivalry. The boy is obsessed with the idea that the girl gets more love from the father. The girl knows the mother prefers the boy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The parents are sure that there is enough love and attention to go round; they feel they are being careful to be fair, not to have favourites. But this may not be at all how the children experience things. Love, they feel, is a finite resource and they aren’t getting enough. If this has been a big issue in our own development, then as we grow older, we are liable to bring this pattern of experience to lots of apparently very different situations. So at work, it can feel as if there is direct competition for the approval of ‘the grown ups’ &#8211; anyone more senior in the organisation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A fix involves a shift of focus. In the picture we can pay attention either to the children or to the parents. Look at the children for a moment. Take in their faces. When we’re focusing on them, of course we can understand how rivalry gets established. It’s totally unsurprising they might feel that way. But we can equally focus attention on the parents. When we do that, we see how unnecessary and tragic the rivalry actually is, because the children are not in fact competing for affection. The parents are full of love. The struggle isn’t real.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we feel drawn into excessive rivalry, we should shift attention from our own longings to the point of view of those we are appealing to for affection, esteem, promotion, money. What we have to ask ourselves is: are they in fact keen to reward only one person? Or would they much rather (as good parents do) have two lovely, healthy, strong successful ‘children’/office workers? Does it make sense from <em>their</em> point of view to allow only you OR your rival (but not both) to succeed?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. People-Pleasing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Somewhere in the past, saying what you felt seemed very dangerous indeed. People-pleasing has its roots in a feeling that you could not be both truthful and loved. Who you were was not enough. You had to dissemble and lie and try to humour someone who appeared distracted, angry, irrational or mean. You were not allowed to be the focus of your own world when you needed to be. You had to find a way to cope &#8211; and you did it by attempting to find out what every person you dealt with wanted, and then trying &#8211; desperately – to give it to them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In one of his plays, Shakespeare gives a quick sketch of just such a formative experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6419" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="image16" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes it feels too dangerous to tell the truth.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At one point in Shakespeare’s <em>Antony and Cleopatra </em>– Act II Scene V –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a poor messenger has to tell Cleopatra that her lover, Antony, has spurned her and married someone else. The queen offers the messenger a fortune to say it’s not so … </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra</em>: Say &#8217;tis not so, a province I will give thee, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And make thy fortunes proud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Messenger</em>: He&#8217;s married, madam. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra</em>: I&#8217;ll unhair thy head: She strikes him</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thou shalt be whipp&#8217;d with wire, and stew&#8217;d in brine,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Messenger:</em> Gracious madam, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I that do bring the news made not the match. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra:</em> Rogue, thou hast lived too long. <em>Draws a knife. </em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shakespeare is showing us a terrifying version of the person who makes it very hard for you to tell them the truth. When you’ve tried to tell the truth and been almost killed for it, it isn’t surprising if you become a bit more careful next time and slowly turn into a people-pleaser. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What important figure in your early life were you afraid of upsetting with your truths or your being?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What happened if you were just ‘yourself’ and honest with them?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Where, today, does this kind of danger lurk for you? Who are you afraid of upsetting?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What would actually be likely to happen if you told them the truth?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How bad would that really be?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6420" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image11.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone could draw their own portrait of the intimidating individual.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us grew up around intimidating types a little like the man in the portrait above. You felt you had to be incredibly careful around them. You were walking on eggshells, terrified of setting them off. They had to be kept in a good mood as much as possible. It could have been an irate father, an overwrought mother, an explosive elder sister; a teacher who seemed to have it in for you; or a harsh early boss. Whomever it was, a pattern of anxiety was laid down. One grew extremely aware of the dangers of upsetting people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once we get more conscious of how this way of seeing others got started, we can begin to sense that &#8211; probably &#8211; it’s not really called for so much in our lives today around the office. Without quite noticing it, we may be sticking with an unfortunate habit that was formed &#8211; very understandably &#8211; to deal with a big problem that belongs very much in the past now, ten or fifteen years ago. It’s a tragedy of emotional life that certain habits have a tendency to stick around even though the situation that originally gave rise to them may have long since changed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to be firmer in ourselves. We’ve adopted an ideal of being pleasing which is in fact not pleasing to anyone in the long term. Put yourself in the shoes of those you’re afraid of. Is it really so nice to be sentimentally lied to? People need to know the bad news to fix it. What small bit of the truth could you start to share with those who run the business everyone wants to see succeed? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Negativity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learn to be negative when life seems to teach us that hope and aspiration are unrealistic and dangerous. And there are definitely times when absorbing a negative stance seems the mark of open-eyed realism and maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What really disappointed you in the past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What was the hope that got crushed? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you deeply wish could have turned out better than it did?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What are you afraid of when you hope?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What might happen if you tried and didn’t succeed?</span></em></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting your hopes up is a very bad idea</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, life really is pretty harsh. At particular times, in specific places, supposing that things can easily get a lot better can be a naive delusion. It’s the danger of focusing on what you want to happen, instead of preparing for what’s likely to happen. There are lots and lots of cases where people come unstuck because they didn’t factor in the potential down-side. So, negativity makes a lot of sense. There are hopes we really would be wise not to nurture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pictures above and below are by the Swiss-American photographer Robert Frank, who travelled around the United States in 1957, taking images for what would become a very famous book called <em>The Americans</em>. It shows us the often bleak reality of a country whose self-image is of relentless positivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the real landscape of our lives, is it such a wonder that many of us grow a defensive shield of pessimism and negativity? Can we not be forgiven for failing to greet pitiless reality with a smile?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image30.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6423" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image30.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="image30" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t get your hopes up around here.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing is: it’s not that always sensible to hose down hope. An attitude of pessimism may really have been needed at key times in our lives, but it isn’t always a requirement. It can keep insisting that we prepare for the worst when, actually, the circumstances are replete with genuine opportunities for those who can bear the vulnerability of hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Bluster</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, we get it into our heads that concern with detail is how one loses sight of &#8211; and connection with &#8211; the important and serious things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did anyone close to you fuss quite a lot in the past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Was anyone a bit pedantic (though that might not have been the word you’d have used at the time)?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How were such people regarded by you and others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In your experience, what happens when people are too fussy?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really to be expected that encounters with unimpressive, irksome fussy and pedantic people will leave us with a negative impression of the value of looking after the details. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fix is to revise our conception of what is important &#8211; and specifically of the relation between the little (apparently minor) things and the big picture issues. The largest waterfall in Europe is in Switzerland,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>on the river Rhine at Schaffhausen. In the 19th century, it was one of the most prestigious subjects for painters, because it represented extraordinary energy, drama and grandeur. Turner painted it around 1805. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6424" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image12.jpg?resize=635%2C393" alt="image12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">J.M.W. Turner, The Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhause (1805-6)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But much to the surprise of certain critics, Turner didn’t just concentrate his attention on the obvious major facts: the cliffs, the water thundering over, the spray. He also took great care to paint accurately a couple of wicker baskets in the foreground; he depicted the neat way some white packages had been tied. What was he doing. Why did he bother with such things? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The explanation was delivered by Turner’s great advocate, John Ruskin, who formulated the principle of <em>The Task of the Least</em>: ‘the minutest portion of a great composition is helpful to the whole. It certainly does not seem easily conceivable that this should be so. But it is the fact.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The little details<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>don’t distract from the big effect; they are essential to creating it. The thundering effect of the water is enhanced by including a humble, static object like a basket and a parcel. By attuning the eye to precision, the artist is priming us to be more responsive to the swirling chaos of the falls. The details aren’t a distraction from the grand effect, they help cause it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a limited arena on a canvas, Turner is making a case for keeping an eye on the task of the least. We should pay attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. Over-Control</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The desire to control springs from the natural response of a competent, energetic person to the imagined lesser abilities of others. In some situations that perception is bang on target. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Fill in the rest of the sentence: when it comes to working properly, most people are &#8230;</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did your early caregivers trust others? Did they trust you?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How competent were your parents? Could you trust them to get it right?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did your parents trust other people?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Where do you think your negative assessment of others’ potential came from?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Describe an early success around taking charge of some task that others clearly couldn’t manage through incompetence.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"> &#8211; What often happens when you try to get others to help with a task?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Could you ever teach people to be better at the tasks you want to help them with?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Competence is not universally and equally distributed. Some people really are a lot more on the ball than others. And it’s no bad thing if they take the lead in organising how things should be done. We ramp up our demand to have control and to have things done our way in response to some well-grounded worries about how things are currently going. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the 1970s, a number of UK car factories – particularly one at Longbridge, in the south of Birmingham &#8211; earned a reputation for low-quality workmanship, inefficiency and poor management.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/489675439.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6919" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/489675439.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Protest Against Cowley Strike" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty/Keystone</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you spent a lot of time around such places and people, you could justifiably come away with the opinion that a lot of people really are pretty incompetent. You might well reach the conclusion that you, personally, could to a lot better if you just managed everything yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image18.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6431" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image18.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="image18" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Panicked impatience makes sense in a world of wasteful incompetence</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The question, though, isn’t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>whether being controlling is ever a good idea. Sometimes, clearly, it is. But it depends: we’ve got a marked tendency for our instincts to be governed not so much by what actually confronts us today, but by what we became most familiar with at formative points in the past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If &#8211; to pursue a thought experiment &#8211; Margaret Thatcher had spent a lot of the 1970s around the Swiss National Railways she might have arrived at different conclusions about the average levels of human competence. She might have learnt to trust that an entire team could be galvanised to be competent and efficient, from the signal controllers in Basel to the station master at the remote outpost of Ennetbürgen in central Switzerland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It all depends on the skills of managers at generating an atmosphere of community and collaboration. Talent isn’t only ever the preserve of just a few: with the right structures in place, it can be a resource of the many. It may be time to exchange the trauma of Longbridge for the faith and hope animating the SBB team.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Secret Manoeuvring</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going behind other people’s backs doesn’t sound very nice when stated directly. But it was not an unreasonable strategy in many of our pasts. From particular situations, we may have developed the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ways of operating that can be summed up with the term ‘secret manoeuvring’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When you were young, who was it not worthwhile ever trying to talk to or change others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you imagine they would have done if you’d tried?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When someone has done something wrong, is your impulse to a) say something b) leave it and move on?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Do you sometimes feel that people betray you? What do you do? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How do you think people will respond if you tell them you have an issue with them?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Suppose someone on the team seems to be a little less bright and determined than you thought: what do you do?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret manoeuvring is a vote of no-confidence in the power of persuasion or education. We resort to behind the scenes arrangements because we’ve had some bad experiences in which our intentions have met with blank stares or hostility and people have refused to change their ways when we attempted to tell them how we felt. We have somewhere in our deep minds drawn a big conclusion: there’s no point in arguing and directly dealing with people.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Under pressure and not sure of other people</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he was Prime Minister, Gordon Brown developed a reputation as someone who was more than usually willing to deal with colleagues by subterfuge rather than face-to-face dialogue. He reportedly deployed his private office to undermine the position of cabinet ministers who were &#8211; to the public eye &#8211; his personal appointees. Rather than convince his colleagues in discussion, or directly assert the authority of his position, he would allegedly give off the record instructions to special assistants he had installed in the relevant civil service department, thus effectively (but secretly) cutting ministers out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If this picture is accurate, the motives for acting in this underhand way need not be entirely sinister. In fact, the ambition is poignant and touching. Gordon Brown was a prime minister with an overwhelming sense of duty and responsibility to the nation, someone who felt he was under great pressure from rivals and from the opposition parties. He also felt that most other people were not quite up to scratch. So in order to get into action the policies he truly believed were in the public interest, he would have felt he had no option but to resort to subterfuge. He had desperately little confidence in his own power to cajole and chivvy his major colleagues; he lacked the maturity to trust in his own ability to gradually draw the best out of people. He felt he had no choice but to go behind their backs &#8211; and make it all happen as it should, without quite talking about it. He was acting disastrously, for the best of reasons&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. Unfriendliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, of course, everyone wants to be friendly. But, we can grow up feeling that friendliness (and what goes with it &#8211; trusting, niceness, sharing) is too costly. It can simply look like it’s the wrong strategy for success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Exercise: </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Which person from your past gave you a sense that nice guys don’t finish first?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you worry could go wrong if you took the time to be friendly?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What happens to nice people, in your view?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not unfriendly because we’re mean or inherently misanthropic, but because niceness has come to seem weak and indulgent. Partly, that’s a matter of prestige. A lot of successful people seem in a great hurry and are rather brusque, and we therefore pick up from them the suggestion that success is dependent on a brutal manner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we need to be exposed to are examples of friendliness working in synch with professional success. From 161 to 180 AD &#8211; the period he ruled as an exceptionally conscientious Roman Emperor &#8211; Marcus Aurelius was officially the busiest man in the world. At any one time he might be fighting off Germanic tribes on the north-east frontier while dealing with incursions by the Parthians in the south east; attempting to control the currency of the imperial economy; acting as the highest judge and simultaneously reforming major areas of the legal system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6435" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image19.jpg?resize=635%2C559" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marcus Aurelius was, by temper and character, inclined to be brusque and dismissive. He was enraged by time-wasters. But he knew in his heart that this wasn’t the way to go. So he tried hard to train himself to temper his irritations with others: they were not, he told himself, wicked inherently so much as sometimes lazy and expedient, as he could be. In his <em>Meditations</em> he wrote rules for himself: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can&#8217;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognised that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.</em> (II. 1) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also reminded himself of attitudes he admired. He thought a lot about one of his mentors, a man called Sextus who, he wrote, had </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>a benevolent disposition: gravity without affectation; able to tolerate ignorant persons and those who form opinions without consideration. He had the power of readily accommodating himself to all; he could express approval without noisy display; he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.</em> [Meditations, book I]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because, like us, he was tempted to be unfriendly, Marcus Aurelius reminded himself on a daily basis that it is entirely possible to be serious, focused and efficient without coming across as rude or unconcerned. If the effort was important enough for him, it should surely be important enough for all of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. Slyness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling that the people around you don’t actually deserve your full commitment and loyalty doesn’t sound very nice. We’d like to think of ourselves as always ready to give our best. But sometimes a person can easily be forgiven for feeling that their colleagues don’t actually deserve much respect.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">To cope here, you’d probably need to get a bit sly.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason we end up being a bit sly is because full participation doesn’t present itself as attractive enough. We’re sly when we feel we’d rather not be part of the team. We need to feel a little more special than others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How are you different from others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In the past, who made you feel special?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did that feeling of specialness come under threat at some point?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Who was hard to please (but you wanted to please them)? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What are groups typically like?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6438" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone in that group is perfect, but they’re good enough… and they’re better for being part of the group.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This painting, by Rembrandt, might help. Imagine you are with them, part of the night watch. You’re going out on a dreary night to interfere with drunks, move on the troublemakers and keep an eye out for thieves and burglars. It beats being at home, because you’re doing it with other people. Those in your team, admittedly, won’t all be your ideal companions or colleagues. Some might be a bit self-regarding, others a bit timid; some are bossy, some are weak. <em>The Night Watch</em> speaks of the appeal of joining in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These people are heading out to patrol the streets on a wet night. But it’s an inviting image. And it would probably be nice to join in if we could. Companionship can be so much better than an isolated, fragile sense of being distinctive. The message of the picture isn’t that the members of the team are all wonderful in and of themselves. But, rather, that it is still worth joining in because a team has something that any one individual won’t: it ennobles all those who take part.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. Not listening</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can easily get impatient with a person who doesn’t listen &#8211; but not-listening can have honourable origins. Even though it becomes a problem when we need to collaborate, not listening doesn’t always originate as a failing. At some moments in development, not listening is key. There may be so many voices, so much noise that can threaten to submerge us, it is a survival strategy to close the doors and focus on a single voice you need to hold on to and have a responsibility towards: your own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When was your voice stifled?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Were you listened to as a child?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When did you feel you had to listen to someone else a lot?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Are you heard enough?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When do you feel that what another person is saying is very unhelpful to you?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1973, the American literary critic Harold Bloom published a seminal book of criticism titled <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em>. In it, he describes how many great writers have suffered from an anxiety about listening too much to the voices of their predecessors. The artists of the past teach us how to write and feel, but they also &#8211; unwittingly &#8211; often threaten to silence the creative potential of the present moment, through their sheer eloquence and brilliance. They stifle our own nascent sensibilities. In Bloom’s view, only a few writers in any generation ever manage to escape from the unhelpful impact of their predecessors &#8211; and go on to produce something which is properly distinctive. Interestingly, says Bloom, these path-breakers do so by a rather odd- and suspicious-sounding strategy, which we can nevertheless learn from. They shut out the voices of others; they acquire the art of not listening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bloom might have been writing primarily about poets of the early modern period, but his theory can be extended beyond the production of art. The story he is telling is simultaneously that of every human’s journey to maturity. In order to find your own voice, you do need &#8211; for a while &#8211; to bracket and silence the louder, more persuasive voices of those who have come before you. Culture provides us with a very reasonable account of why for all of us, at times, not-listening is likely to be a noble and important strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not-listening takes root in situations where there’s a genuine tussle, a real conflict between either taking in the points another person is making or exploring and developing your own insights. At certain moments, especially in childhood or at the beginning of a creative endeavour, this is the tussle we face. But &#8211; as with so many of our unhelpful behaviours around groups &#8211; we don’t have to stay stuck here: we can move beyond the vulnerability that first led us to adopt a particular and costly ‘defence’. We do not have to keep on always behaving as if we remained in the dangerous situation that first required a defence. We can, with effort and sympathy for ourselves, take a few modest steps towards opening our ears to the voices of others, ever more secure that our own distinctiveness will &#8211; once the meeting or chat is over &#8211; continue unscathed.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                           ***</p>
<p class="p1">Growing up isn&#8217;t ever quick, or really quite done. But to study these ten possible areas of immaturity signals a start of a journey towards solving some of the issues that bedevil office life and poison some of the most precious opportunities of our lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don’t often think about it – and may never discuss it with others at all – but pretty much everyone has voices in their heads. Not in any sinister or disturbing way: just the murmuring stream of thoughts that runs along inside our minds most of the time. Sometimes, the voice is more explicit, encouraging you to run those final few yards: ‘you’re nearly there, keep going, keep going’. Or you might find yourself berating your ex in your head: ‘You never understood how much you hurt me, I tried to tell you, but you’d never take it in. You were always running away from the truth about yourself, weren’t you?’ And maybe the tone here is more assured and calmer than in fact you ever quite managed to be with them on that topic.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the inner voice is simply not very nice at all. It is defeatist and punitive, panic-ridden and humiliating. It doesn’t represent anything like our best insights or most mature capacities. It’s not the voice of our better nature. We find ourselves saying: ‘You disgust me, things always go to shit with you.’ This might feel natural, but another person in a similar situation might have in <em>their</em> head a very different kind of inner monologue: ‘you’ve been here before and it was OK; it’s tough and that’s fine, you’re going to pull through, just keep calm.’</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2106069013_c00dda691c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6106" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2106069013_c00dda691c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2106069013_c00dda691c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Where do inner voices come from? An inner voice always used to be an outer voice. We’ve absorbed the tone of a harassed or angry parent; the menacing threats of an elder sibling keen to put us down; the words of a schoolyard bully or a teacher who seemed impossible to please. We internalised the unhelpful voices because at certain key moments in the past they sounded compelling. The authority figures repeated their messages over and over until they got lodged in our own way of thinking.</p>
<p>To change our inner voices we need to encounter equally convincing and confident, but also helpful and constructive varieties of voices over long periods. We need to hear them often enough and around tricky enough issues that they come to feel normal and natural responses – so that, eventually, they come to feel like things we are saying to ourselves; they become our own thoughts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are very much more likely to have the irritated voice of a teacher berating us (aged seven) for not knowing the four times table than to have the voice of Donald Winnicott playfully and lightly encouraging us to take perspective. Or it’s more likely we’ve got the words of Melissa Fry (aged 13) making us feel eternally inadequate for having the wrong haircut, skinny shoulders or the wrong kind of bike burnt into our imaginations, rather than the voice of Montaigne reminding us wryly of the universal character of folly and reminding us that (in truth) no one worth caring about judges other people in those terms.</p>
<p>Slightly brutish voices tend to be the ones that speak loudest, while the nicest, kindest, wisest and most constructive voices are comparatively quiet. So, if we want to internalise the better voices, we need to have a deliberate and active strategy for making this happen. Leaving things to chance won’t do, because the odds are we won’t meet these really benign voices at the moments when we most need them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>El Greco, <em>St. Dominic Praying</em> (1588)</h6>
<p>In the past, religions took the idea of voice-internalisation very seriously – and developed a variety of rituals and concepts to help this to occur. One of them was prayer. Certain prayers involved the frequent, regular repetition of helpful turns of phrase, like: ‘I have sinned in my thoughts and in my deed; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do&#8230;’ &#8211; which is an attempt to internalise humility.</p>
<p>Catholicism introduced the practice of the conscious ‘imitation’ of the saints, where one was invited to ask what a particular saint would have thought or said on a stressful or tempting occasion. Catholicism sets before its believers some two-and-a half thousand of the greatest, most virtuous human beings who it feels have ever lived, offering them up as potential friends whom the faithful can talk to, look at and be inspired by. These saints are each in their different ways exemplars of qualities we should hope to nurture in ourselves. Saint Joseph, for instance, may teach us how to cope calmly with the pressures of a young family and how to face the trials of the workplace with a modest and uncomplaining temper. There are moments when we may want to break down and sob in the company of Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, whose gentle manner can grant us comfort without any need to find immediate solutions or even hope. At times of anxiety, we could turn to Saint Philip Neri, who would never underplay our problems or humiliate us but would know how to tease out our sense of the absurd and make us laugh therapeutically at our condition. We might find it particularly consoling to guess at how the imperturbable Saint Philip would handle the hazards of a family reunion or the crash of a computer&#8217;s hard drive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Guercino, <em>Philip Neri</em> (1656)</h6>
<p>To enhance our imaginative connections with the saints, Catholicism provides us with calendars that list their birthdays, so that we may have regular occasion to withdraw from our social circle and contemplate the lives of people better than we are, for example, people who gave away all their money and wandered the earth doing good works while wearing a rough tunic to crucify the flesh (St Francis) or who used their faith in God to magically reattach a severed ear to its distressed owner&#8217;s head (St Cuthbert).</p>

<h5>An opportunity to remember positive inner voices: a sixteenth-century English psalter, tabling the birthdays of, among others, Saints Hugh, Katherine, Theodore, Edmund, Clement, Barbara, Lucy and Osmund</h5>
<p>The Christian idea of a ‘patron saint’ is really a device for getting us to internalise a voice that is useful at times of difficulty or anguish.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Andrea_Mantegna_088.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6112" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Andrea_Mantegna_088.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="Andrea_Mantegna_088" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Andrea Mantegna, <em>St. Sebastian</em> (1480)</h6>
<p>Saint Sebastian (who was shot by Roman archers on the orders of the Emperor Diocletian in 288 AD) is the archetypal voice of  courage and commitment; he’s urging us to stand firm, to stick with our convictions even though people might be saying very critical or mean things, and to believe that suffering and being treated unjustly are normal (though horrible) parts of the well-lived life. We can admire the determination of these Catholic saints to shape constructive, helpful, sane and kind inner voices – without entirely agreeing on what those voices might be saying.</p>
<p>In addition, Catholicism perceives that there is a benefit to being able to see our ideal friends around the house in miniaturised three dimensional representations. After all, most of us began our lives by having nurturing relationships with bears, bunnies and other animals, whom we would talk to and would be tacitly addressed by in turn. These animals were skilful at conveying their consoling and inspiring personalities to us. We would talk to them when we were sad and were comforted when we looked across the bedroom and saw them stoically enduring the night on our behalf.</p>

<h5>Internalising teddy’s voice: teddy is calm, cheerful, gentle… everything we want to be ourselves</h5>
<p>Catholicism sees no reason to discontinue the structure behind such relationships and so invites us to buy wood, stone, resin or plastic versions of the saints and place them on shelves or alcoves in our rooms and hallways. At times of domestic chaos, we can look across at a plastic statuette and inwardly ask what Saint Francis of Assisi would recommend that we say to our furious spouse or hysterical children now. The answer may be inside us all along, but it doesn&#8217;t usually emerge or become effective until we go through the exercise of formally asking the question of a saintly figurine.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.saintfrancisgarden.com/images/st-francis-statue.png?resize=264%2C368" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><em>                                            </em>  St Francis: What would he do next?</h5>
<p>A well-functioning secular society should take more care with its role models and &#8216;voice&#8217; internalisation processes. The harshness of our inner voices could be corrected by having access to a range of imaginary friends, whose fortifying wisdom we would regularly and ritually be able to remind ourselves of. An absence of religious belief in no way invalidates a continuing need for patron saints of qualities like Courage, Friendship, Fidelity, Patience, Confidence or Scepticism. We can still profit from moments when we give internal space to the voices of people who are more balanced, brave and generous-spirited than we are. Like children with their favourite stuffed animals, we might spend time with mature beings, through whose imaginary presence we could hope to reconnect with our calmest possibilities.</p>
<p>There are essentially six different types of stress – and six kinds of ‘inner voice’ we need to foster in order to deal with them.</p>
<p><strong>One: ANGER-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<p>One of the major kinds of stress can be termed ‘anger-stress’. This is when the feeling of not being able to cope is translated into shouting, rage and slammed doors. One seems merely angry, but beneath the theatrics, there is – importantly – a particular kind of panic at work.</p>
<p>Anger-stress arises in response to unexpected setbacks. For example, when a sudden drilling starts up in the street outside, just at the moment when one is settling down to do some concentrated work: the drill seems to be attempting to shatter one’s mind rather than the pavement. Last week it was the drains, now it’s the cable guys doing their nonsense. How can one live in a city like this?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14638999_23c9f794cf_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6964" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14638999_23c9f794cf_z.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="14638999_23c9f794cf_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or else panic sets in when bureaucracy shows its most intransigent face: one is at the airport, there are 19 minutes until the plane is due to takes off, one can see it through the window, but the staff member insists that regulations require one to be 20 minutes ahead of the gate push-back time in order to board. One has a meeting to go to in a foreign city, 30 people are waiting, it’s crucial for business; one begs and cajoles, but to no avail. One ends up – very shamefully – calling the check-in person a ‘stupid fu***** automaton’ and banging the desk in fury like a child.</p>
<p>Or else the brilliantly slim and light laptop we’ve just bought freezes up and displays an error message just ahead of sending colleagues an important document. One curses those oily optimistic people at Apple, who seem so damn indifferent to one’s fate.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>The cause of the anger-stress is a seeming deep injustice which appears not to be recognised by the world. A particular craziness, unreliability, meanness, obtuseness appears not to have received enough attention – and therefore one erupts into anger in a vain attempt to correct or protest at the indifference of others. The outburst draws energy from a desire to externalise the pain the world has inflicted and to strike back with equal force (even if only by flinging a cushion against the wall). Our anger is a (doomed) attempt to communicate the degree to which our sense of justice has been violated. We want everyone to know that the behaviour of the airline is outrageous, that the roadworks are profoundly wrong and that it is absurd that the richest corporation in the world should make laptops that routinely crash. We make a lot of noise because no one else seems to realise how terrible it all is.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6731286269_aa62433fc2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6116" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6731286269_aa62433fc2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="6731286269_aa62433fc2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Our rage comes down to a betrayed optimism: a dramatic gap has opened up between how we expected things were going to go and how they have actually turned out. We had believed that the morning at home would be tranquil; we had believed boarding the flight would be easy, we had assumed the computer was reliable&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>The priority is to redraw one’s underlying image of what is normal in a more gently pessimistic direction. One is suffering not merely because things have gone wrong, but because they have gone wrong against a backdrop where one expected them to go right; and it is this second, aggravating factor that is both vicious in its effects and yet eminently amenable to treatment.</p>
<p>Stress-anger is laced with strong doses of paranoia. It seems one has been singled out for suffering. So one has to open the lens and see that one’s mishaps, though maddening, are neither unique nor representative of anything in one’s character. No one is specifically out to get us. Many millions have suffered computer malfunctions. Airline staff are known the world over for their intransigent manner. The laying down of fiber optic cables has turned all streets into drilling zones. We need to get more acquainted with the ample role of frustration in every ordinary and good life.</p>

<p>It’s important that such bad news be broken to us in a particular way; a voice which seems gentle, kind and unhurried. It should feel as if a sympathetic arm was being put around our shoulder by someone who has lived long and seen a great many sad things, which hasn’t embittered them however, but has afforded them a melancholy wry look on the trials of existence. They tell us that ‘of course’ life is frustrating and that in many ways, it would have been better never to have been born. They know how it feels, they have been there too (our rages which we’re now embarrassed about are things that every decent human being sometimes goes through; it’s nothing to be proud of, but nor is it a reason to hate oneself indefinitely. We&#8217;ve all had our hysterical moments).</p>
<p>It is helpful not just to know these arguments in theory, but also to have an example of someone who put them into practice in their own life. We need a patron saint of experienced, wry pessimism; a patron saint to help quell the rash optimism that lies beneath our most vicious outbursts.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Arthur_Schopenhauer_1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6118" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Arthur_Schopenhauer_1.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="Arthur_Schopenhauer_1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Born in Danzig in 1788, Arthur Schopenhauer is one of the world&#8217;s finest philosophers and most adorable grumps: “There is only one inborn error,&#8217; he tells us, &#8216;and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy… So long as we persist in this inborn error… the world will seem to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of maintaining a happy existence… hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear the expression of what is called disappointment.”</p>
<p>Schopenhauer is always speaking in the voice of mature pessimism: of course, things work out pretty badly, he tells us, with a glint of humour in his eyes. They usually do. What else can one expect? The world is populated by bastards, fools and selfish egoists. I get it. They’ve let you down. ‘I know’, he tells us down the ages. The same kind of thing happened to me just about every single day of my life&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3202229684_c476819e8b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6967" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3202229684_c476819e8b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C633" alt="3202229684_c476819e8b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schopenhauer tells us without bitterness that life is quite sad. He’s free of bitterness because he is not expecting it to be wonderful; he’s not surprised or amazed or even particularly disappointed when marriage, career, travel, social life – and the mending of the roads – turn out to be a bit awful.</p>
<p>If we can internalise his words and the attitude they express and draw upon them we we need them, then our rage and bitterness are lessened, we are still faced with problems – of course – we still have to book the flight, get on with working or sort out the power supply, but with a slightly less panicked and persecuted air.</p>
<p>Feast on the consoling, stress-reducing pessimism of this noble patron saint:</p>
<p>&#8220;We can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Human existence must be a kind of error… it may be said of it, &#8216;It is bad today and every day it will get worse, until the worst of all happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is like a soap-bubble which we maintain and inflate for as long as possible, yet with the absolute certainty that it will burst.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/964667837_4ab27f92e2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6968" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/964667837_4ab27f92e2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="964667837_4ab27f92e2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is a sorry business, I have resolved to spend it reflecting upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I speak to men and women just as a little girl speaks to her doll. She knows, of course, that the doll does not understand her, but she creates for herself the joy of communication through a pleasant and conscious self-deception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should always be mindful of the fact that no man is ever very far from the state in which he would readily want to seize a sword or poison in order to bring his existence to an end; and those who are far from believing this could easily be convinced of the opposite by an accident, an illness, a violent change of fortune – or of the weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After his fortieth year… any man of merit&#8230; will hardly be free from a certain touch of misanthropy”</p>
<p>And finally, a sentence that should be written above all airport entrances and on the back of computers: “Human existence must be a kind of error.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Two: HUMILIATION-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>Stress is always closely tied to a fear of failing at something. Humiliation-stress is a particular subcategory where what one most fears about failing are &#8211; in essence &#8211; the imagined mean reactions of others. One is stressed about being laughed at and denigrated, about having one&#8217;s faults cruelly discussed, about being the butt of jokes; one is going to fail and lose one’s dignity and good standing.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209413578_77a5a61623_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6120" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209413578_77a5a61623_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="3209413578_77a5a61623_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This is the stress that kicks in minutes before one is due to go on stage to give a presentation; or when one is going to finally launch an online business that one left a secure job in order to start; or when one is publishing a book, standing for office or will be ranked in the office sales force hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>In states of humiliation-stress, the mocking and contemptuous voice has come right inside one’s head. It’s no-longer simply stating the mean thoughts of other people, it’s become the voice of one’s own fears – whatever the outside world is actually saying. One is always ready with a highly dispiriting narrative about who one is. At times, one can just about tolerate oneself. With lots of success, one can stay one step ahead of the inner denigrator, but every time a challenge looms, the critical voice comes back: ‘I am indeed, as the critics say, an idiot, a failure and a fool’.</p>
<p>Humiliation-stress is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because we’re so nervous around possible humiliation – because this fear is so active and powerful – we get flustered and make extra mistakes, we lose focus, we stumble and get confused. And then of course we do become the targets for the harsh, humiliating judgements of others.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209421302_5bc8c81501_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6121" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209421302_5bc8c81501_z.jpg?resize=635%2C402" alt="3209421302_5bc8c81501_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>© Flickr/Tobias Toft</h6>
<p>The root cause of humiliation-stress is the belief that love, respect and kindness only ever come via worldly success or competence. Deep down we have become convinced that certain kinds of imperfect action (not being able to make a public speech, taking time to learn to drive a car, not being especially brilliant at sales, writing a mediocre book) rightly debar anyone from the warm embrace of love and appreciation. Only those who succeed can be loved.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We urgently need to incorporate a voice that separates out achievement from love: that reminds us that we may be worthy of affection even if we fail and that being winner is only one part, and not necessarily the most important part, of one’s identity.</p>
<p>This is – traditionally – the voice of the mother, but perhaps also of the nine-year-old child chatting to his or her mum or dad about a stress at the office. It is the voice of a person who loves you for being you, outside of achievement.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, knowing one is loved whatever happens to one in the world sets up ideal preconditions for doing well. It gives one the energy to take risks and feel resilient – without letting acute anxiety get in the way of performance.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: GUANYIN</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13801979266.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6122" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13801979266.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="13801979266" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Guanyin, 12th Century</h6>
<p>In Buddhism, Guanyin is a reassuring female deity one goes to visit in temples and chats to about one&#8217;s largest woes. Like the Virgin Mary, she hears us in our distress, meets us with tenderness and strengthens us to face the tasks of life. She is the person one thinks of when one can’t cope, when one just wants to weep, pull the duvet over one’s head and craves to be forgiven by someone deeply kind and gentle. We should be mature enough to allow ourselves moments when we regress to be in the company of such a voice.</p>
<p>The centrality of maternal figures in both Buddhism and Christianity suggests that adult lives share moments of deep self-doubt – and longings to recover some of the security of childhood. We need to be reassured that these wishes are not a sign that we have failed as human beings.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2236162299_acdef877fa_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6969" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2236162299_acdef877fa_z.jpg?resize=635%2C594" alt="2236162299_acdef877fa_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guanyin’s role is to hear us in our distress, to listen with mercy and tenderness to our fears. She gives voice to the thought that adult life inevitably will involve moments of deep self-doubt, and feelings that one cannot cope alone. Such vulnerability is not to be read as a sign we have failed as a human. Guanyin&#8217;s implicit thesis is that being loved and worldly success are two separate things. You deserve compassion not because of the excellence of what you do, but because you exist. Achievement is not the currency of kindness.</p>
<p>We need to make this voice our own and to summon it inside our own heads when faced with humiliation-stress. It doesn’t make the task go away. One will still have to make the speech, get better at selling (or find another job); but these real tasks can now be faced with a little more poise. Because a little less is on the line. The root of the extreme stress was not purely the fear that one might fail. Rather it was the incendiary thought that failure would mean you deserved to be ridiculed and abandoned. When the threat of that emotional catastrophe is lifted, one is better placed to get on and cope with the practical tasks to hand.</p>
<p><strong>Three: PANIC-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>You’re up against a huge challenge: you’ve recently taken up rock-climbing as a sport. You’re in Scotland, several hundred meters above the ground, on a cliff face. Suddenly, you panic. You can’t do this. You’re meant to keep climbing another thirty meters, veering to the left, making use of the drier limestone, before you reach flat ground and can make it gently down to Fort William. The problem is, you’re unable to make even a single move. Fear has frozen you. You’re going to drop down and meet your end at the base of the cliff. You have had a look below and the trees seem like matchsticks. You have a wife (who told you this wasn’t a good idea) and three children at home.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2620130472_6317cb55bc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6970" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2620130472_6317cb55bc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="2620130472_6317cb55bc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Or, to take another example, you’re supposed to get a report done before Tuesday, but there are three big sections that you’re not quite on top of yet. You are also supposed to give a briefing on Monday about the Swedish strategy and there’s a problem emerging with the new key legal person you hired last month. You feel that the problems are too hard and multiple and that you will soon be found out by the management. You put your head in your hands and are deeply tempted to walk across to the corner office and hand in your resignation.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES:</strong></p>
<p>In deciding whether or not panic is appropriate, we don’t calmly scan the horizon, measure our strengths, take a cool assessment of our own capacities and mobilise our forces in strict response to the demands of the situation. We respond by instinct – and these instincts are often nothing more than the incorporated voices of some distinctly panicky others from way back.</p>
<p>Many of us grew up around nervous people: people who lost their tempers the moment the parking ticket couldn’t be found, who were knocked off course by relatively minor administrative hurdles (the electricity bill), who felt daunted by the prospect of going on holiday (there were always screams on the way to the airport) and who grew jumpy every time they momentarily mislaid the house keys&#8230; These people had no faith in themselves and therefore – without necessarily wanting to do us harm – couldn’t have much faith in our own abilities. Every time we faced an exam, they got more alarmed than we did. They always asked multiple times if we had enough to wear when we went outside. They worried about our friends and our teachers. They were sure the gap year was going to turn into a disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1466951877_bd59b406c6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6127" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1466951877_bd59b406c6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="1466951877_bd59b406c6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now these voices have become our own and cloud our capacity to take an accurate measure of what we are capable of. We have internalised voices of irrational fear and fragility.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>It’s a symptom of panic that our alarmed response feels – at the time – deeply plausible. It doesn’t reveal that it is an exaggerated response that is blinding us to an accurate assessment of our possibilities.</p>
<p>At such moments, we need an outside voice that can pause our runaway fears and remind us of the strengths we have latent within us, which the currents of panic have hidden from us.</p>
<p>Fear is catching, but – just as importantly – so can confidence be. If another person whom one respects tell us with calm authority that (from where they are standing) they sincerely think we can do it, we may just be able to find the wherewithal to side with their verdict. We respond well to having a good image of ourselves to try to live up to – as every good leader knows.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: GENERAL EISENHOWER</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower_d-day.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6125" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower_d-day.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="Eisenhower_d-day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>General Dwight D. Eisenhower addresses American paratroopers prior to D-Day</h6>
<p>General Eisenhower led American troops through some of the most fearful events of World War II. He was legendary for spending a lot of time with his soldiers on the front, and in particular, with managing to transmit a high degree of confidence to them.</p>
<p>When he told his troops (as he often did) ‘I know you can do it,’ this wasn’t a vapid bromide thrown out to encourage hapless cannon fodder before he bolted back to the comforts of his command centre. It reflected a real faith that his young American charges truly had a very good chance of pushing back the German forces that controlled northern France. Though the Germans had been victorious in the West since 1939, Eisenhower understood that in the long-term, the advantage would necessarily go to the Allies: they had the largest number of troops, superior technology and men motivated by a love of freedom rather than fear of dictatorship. His confidence wasn’t bluster, it was based on seeing virtues in his men that fear had blinded them to. His words bridged the gap between what they were capable of, and what – on the night before parachuting into Normandy – they could remember of themselves through the fog of their anxiety.</p>
<p>We should – when facing our own more modest challenges – have a version of Eisenhower in our own minds, ready to remind us that (tomorrow morning) we will surely have the strength to do what the task demands of us.</p>
<p><strong>FOUR: SHAME-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<p>This is the stress one feels in the wake of having done some shameful things: stayed in bed all day when we should have been at work; downloaded pornography on the family computer; shouted at a guy at the office; procrastinated for three weeks with a report; flirted with the person in charge of North American sales&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14496537236_932d9a9acd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6971" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14496537236_932d9a9acd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="14496537236_932d9a9acd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Flickr/Holly Lay</h6>
<p>It’s evident that normal, kind, sensible, mature people aren’t meant to do these things. There’s something wrong with us. We are one of the sick, warped ones. We are worried, fearful for the future, but more than that, ashamed of who we are.</p>
<p>This isn’t just unpleasant. This limits one’s ability to move on. The existence of the bad thing becomes a reason never to develop. ‘If you’re here, you’ve got to stay here’, says the inner voice. Or, even more brutally, ‘You’re doomed not to be a freak.’</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>The panic is rooted in an inability to get a clear picture of what is actually normal. The panicked person suffering from shame-stress can’t believe that quite good people have been through similar rather contemptible moments.</p>
<p>People who otherwise displayed loyalty, dedication, seriousness, grandeur also went through stages where they were extraordinarily lazy, or mean or did some strange things around sex.</p>
<p>These lapses may not be anything to be proud of, but they have a role in the narrative of an ordinary well-lived life. People whom one admires have been here too.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We need to broaden our sense of how much contemptible stuff can go on in an otherwise good life.</p>
<p>We don’t need a voice that condones our bad sides: we need one that can calmly recognise them and accept them as the price people sometimes have to pay in order to move on to a further stage of growth.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: MADAME DEVAUCAY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image24.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6129" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image24.png?resize=507%2C661" alt="image24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In 1807, Ingres painted the portrait of Madame Antonia Devaucay de Nittis, a beautiful young woman living in Rome, who had been the mistress of many men at the top of Napoleonic French society and was at that moment the girlfriend of the French Ambassador to the Holy See, Charles Jean Marie Alquier. Antonia and Charles were having to navigate some choppy diplomatic waters: Napoleon had forcibly summoned Pope Pius VII to Paris in 1804 to attend his coronation as Emperor. The Pope resented but couldn’t ignore French power. Madame Devaucay needed to be political and persuasive without in any way seeming to be.</p>
<p>In Ingres’s remarkable picture, we contemplate not merely the appearance of a particular woman, as she was in Rome in 1807. We see the sort of person who might be able to rehabilitate us in our own eyes after a shameful episode. She is a corrective to shame-stress.</p>
<p>Something about Madame Devaucay’s mouth and smile speaks of worldly tolerance. It is easy to believe that we could tell this mouth almost anything (how we hadn’t paid our taxes or had done something bad in the French Revolution or had unusual sexual tastes), and its owner wouldn’t hold us primly to account, wouldn’t react with shock or moralising or provincial censorship; she would know her fair share about how troubled our souls can get without losing their claim to a fundamental decency.</p>
<p>Irritation with oneself can mount to unbearable levels because it feels so unusual to be foolish, sexual, furious, lazy&#8230; The inner voice says: you are the worst person, unique in your capacity for stupid behaviour (losing your temper, making a clumsy attempt to kiss X, wasting money, telling a lie to save your skin). By contrast Madame Devaucay is the voice of complex understanding.</p>
<p>She was very good at consoling people (Ingres included). She wasn’t frightened or shocked by admissions of frailty or failure. We can imagine her down the centuries saying: ‘I know you feel an idiot, but everyone is a bit like that sometimes; I understand. Actually, tomorrow it will seem quite funny and we’ll joke about it together. I’ve seen so much worse, from people you wouldn’t believe, even respectable and dignified ones whom we all admire&#8230;’</p>
<p><strong>FIVE: EXAGGERATION-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>This is the sort of stress where, to an outsider, it is at once apparent that perspective has been lost:</p>
<p>– someone has missed the train, now they’re saying they want to kill themselves.<br />
– someone has had an argument with their partner over the washing up, now they want to break up.<br />
– someone didn’t come first in the exam; now they feel their entire career is over.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>In the visual arts, having perspective means a capacity to see different things in their true spatial relations: what is far away looks distant and smaller, what is near looks closer and larger. It was surprisingly difficult for artists to learn how to achieve perspective on a canvas – which suggests that the manoeuvre may be equally challenging in other areas of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6130" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>Before the discovery of perspective: a swan is bigger than a tree and people would never fit through the doors of the houses</h6>
<p>In our lives, having perspective involves an ability to compare an apparently traumatic event in the present with the experiences of humanity across the whole of its history – in order to work out what level of attention and fear it should fairly demand. How stressed should we be – really – about the argument, the delayed plane, the less than stellar result?</p>
<p>With perspective in mind, we soon realise that – contrary to what our inner voices suggest – hardly anything is totally unprecedented, few things are truly amazing and very little is absolutely terrible. The sacking will not mean the end of us; it will just change a lot of things in many different small and complicated ways. The economic indices are grim, but we have weathered comparable drops many times and even the worst scenarios only predict that we will return to a standard of living we had a few years ago, when life was still possible. A bad flu may disrupt international travel and defeat known drugs for a while, but research laboratories will eventually understand and contain it. The floods look dramatic, but in the end, they will affect merely a fraction of the population and recede soon enough. Cancers and heart-attacks have multiple causes that we may never understand completely, but eternal life was never on the agenda. Rome fell, but six hundred years later, everything was almost back to normal again.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We need our dramas to be returned to size. We need to be made to feel small.</p>
<p>To be made to ‘feel small’ is, to be sure, a painful daily reality of the human playground. But to be made to feel small by something mighty, noble, accomplished and intelligent is to have wisdom presented to us along with a measure of kindness and persuasiveness. There are sights in the natural world (icebergs, mountains, stars) that can induce us to surrender our egoism without in any way humiliating us. We can set aside our ordinary concerns and take on board (in a way we never dare to do when we are under direct fire from other humans) the miniscule size of our dramas. We can survey ourselves as if from a distance, no longer offended by the wounds inflicted on our self-esteem, feeling newly indifferent to our eventual fate, generous towards the universe and open-minded about its course.</p>
<p>In moments of frustration and disaster, the philosopher Spinoza recommended that we consider what befalls us from a cosmic perspective or in his famous and lyrical coinage, &#8216;under the aspect of eternity&#8217;, <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>. Fascinated by the new generation of telescopes and the knowledge of other planets that they yielded, Spinoza proposed that we imaginatively step out of ourselves and practice submitting our will to the laws of the universe, however contrary these might be to our intentions.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spinoza1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spinoza1.jpg?resize=635%2C556" alt="Spinoza" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We should comfort ourselves for our humiliations not by trying to puff ourselves up, but by taking steps to further appreciate our nothingness. The modern world lacks rituals to put us gently in our place. It surreptitiously incites us to consider the present moment as the summit of history and the achievements of our fellow humans as the measure of all things – a grandiosity destined to plunge the majority of us into continuous swirls of anxiety and envy.</p>
<p>Religion used to restore perspective: at morning prayer and the weekly service, at the harvest celebration and the baptism, greater or lesser moments when we imaginatively step out of the earthly city and recalibrate our lives according to a larger, more cosmic set of measurements.</p>
<p>If there is any point of access to this process of re-evaluation open to both atheists and believers, it is via an element in nature that looms large in Spinoza&#8217;s <em>Ethics</em>; it is through the contemplation of the stars that we are afforded the best chance of accessing redeeming feelings of awe.</p>

<p>Sadly, the scientific authorities officially in charge of interpreting the stars for us rarely realise the therapeutic import of the material they oversee. In austere scientific language, space agencies inform us of the properties and trajectories of heavenly bodies, yet they seldom consider astronomy as either a source of wisdom or a plausible answer to suffering.</p>
<p>However, science should matter to us not only because it helps us to control parts of the world, but also because it shows us what we will never master. We would do well to dwell daily, as the religious do on their God, on the nine and half trillion kilometres in a single light-year or on the luminosity of the largest known star in our galaxy, Eta Carinae, 7,500 light years away, 400 times the size of the sun and 4 million times as bright. We should punctuate our calendars with celebrations in honour of VY Canis Majoris, a red hypergiant in the constellation Canis Major, 5,000 light-years from earth and 2,100 times the size of the Sun. Nightly, after the main news bulletin and before the celebrity quiz, there should be a moment of solemnity as we dwell upon the 200 to 400 billion stars in our galaxy, the 100 billion galaxies and the 3 septillion stars in the universe. Whatever their value to science, the stars are in the end just as valuable to mankind as solutions to our megalomania and anxiety.</p>
<p>In recognition of our need to be repeatedly connected through our senses to ideas of transcendence, we should ensure that a percentage of all prominently positioned television screens be connected to live feeds from the transponders of our extraplanetary telescopes.</p>
<p>We would then be able to ensure that our frustrations, broken hearts, hatreds of those who haven&#8217;t called us and regrets for opportunities that have passed us by are continuously rubbed up against, and salved by, the thought of galaxies like Messier 101, a spiral structure 23 million light years away, sitting in the bottom left of the constellation Ursa Major, majestically unaware of everything that we are and consolingly unsaddened by all that tears us apart.</p>

<p><strong>SIX: HUMOURLESS-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>A lot of stress has the incidental quality of being extremely earnest. With immense solemnity, we worry to an extraordinary extent about the results for Q3. Profits are marginally down in the Asia-Pacific region, and it seems as if someone had died. An interviewee is five minutes late, and everyone in the room is starting to twitch, look at their phones and remember all the other, far better things they could be doing.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>As in exaggeration-stress, perspective has been lost, an ostensibly small things have started to loom very large.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>When dealing with exaggeration-stress, the strategy is to <strong><em>minimise</em> </strong>the stressful situation in order to usher in calm.</p>
<p>But when dealing with humourless-stress, we need to take a different line: we need to <strong><em>exaggerate</em></strong> the stressful situation to such an extent that it becomes a source of comedy and therefore of a certain kind of calm too.</p>
<p>The strategy is to maximise the exaggeration to the point where even the worrier can see that their stress has grown far larger than its cause.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: MICKEY SACKS (WOODY ALLEN)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Hannah and her Sisters </em>(1986)<em>,</em> Woody Allen plays Mickey Sacks, who is like you and me, except a little more so. Everything we might worry about, he is onto already and he worries so much, with such theatricality and whining New York intonations, it has the peculiar effect of calming us down and making us laugh at our own exaggerations.</p>
<p>What we worry about every now and then, Mickey worries about at every moment. He worries about sex, the meaning of life, his relationships – and most of all, he worries about dying.</p>
<p>He is constantly detecting symptoms of his mortal diseases. Recently, he’s started to hear a slight buzzing sound in one ear. It can mean only one thing… He is dying of a brain tumour. This is how he interacts with his colleague Gail, as recorded in Woody Allen&#8217;s script for the film:</p>
<p><em>The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen. She takes off her glasses and squints.</em></p>
<p>GAIL<br />
Mickey, what&#8217;s the matter with you? You&#8217;re all white!</p>
<p><em>The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands. He walks over to Gail. The phone continues to ring.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I don&#8217;t feel well.</p>
<p><em>He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
Do you hear a ringing? Is there, is there a, is there a ringing sound?</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
(gesturing)<br />
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear, I hear it.</p>
<p><em>She sits down and picks up the phone.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
N-n-no, not that.</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
<em>(overlapping, into the telephone)</em><br />
Hello?</p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
<em> (turning to Gail, gesturing nervously)</em><br />
Sssss, if I have a brain tumour, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna do.</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
You don&#8217;t have a brain tumour. The doctor didn&#8217;t say you had a brain tumour.</p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
No, naturally. They&#8217;re not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th&#8211;, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell &#8216;em. Oh, God!<br />
<em>(looking around worriedly and touching Gail&#8217;s shoulder: the phone is ringing again)</em><br />
Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?</p>
<p>Mickey is the voice of comic exaggeration. He helps us feel less stressed – and cope better with our worries because he makes them look so large, even we’re forced to concede that perspective has been lost. Most of the time, we tend not even to notice that we are exaggerating. That&#8217;s why we need comic voices. From the inside it feels simply so serious what time the taxi is going to come, or who said what to the boss or what the doctor will say. Mickey shows us how to deflate our exaggerations by pushing them further and further until their absurdity become obvious, and we willingly take the air out of them.</p>
<p>For this to work, the comedy has to be generous. If we simply mock Mickey (ourselves), we don’t gain any therapeutic benefit. Ideally satire and parody don’t leave us humiliated, because that’s no help in trying to cope better with anxiety. Rather, they teach us to be witty about our troubles and sorrows.</p>
<p>It’s a slightly weird truth that a lot of anxiety (and conflict) grows because we haven’t got a good way of backing out. We sort of know we are being silly in our massive worries and especially in our arguments with those close to us. It’s just that we don’t know how to climb down without being humiliated and perhaps conceding too much to the other person’s equally exaggerated contrary views.</p>
<p>Funniness, self-parody, irony, wry wit and humour all allow an attractive method of backing down while preserving one’s self-respect.</p>

<p>In different ways, these six voices are correctives to our most vicious and unhelpful inner narratives. We should take care to rehearse them at moments when we can lay claim to a measure of sanity and calm &#8211; so they&#8217;ll be with us the next time the drilling starts or the plane is delayed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the reasons we sometimes don&#8217;t think things through properly is that they seem so simple. Physics is very complicated and &#8211; helpfully &#8211; it signals that it is:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://coraifeartaigh.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/einsteinjpgjpg-4a389e85f92a0547.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="415" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AP</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What it says on the tin: theoretical physics is really hard</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Einstein’s blackboard makes it totally plain why one won’t be able to make fundamental advances in science without thinking very deeply. The process is incredibly complicated<strong><em> and looks very complicated too</em></strong> – which is a bonus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, many other impressive results don’t come with a public reminder of the thinking that went into them. They look simple, natural and easy.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6975" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o.jpg?resize=635%2C428" alt="13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<h6>© D68 Design+art</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It looks as if anyone could have designed this in about two minutes</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the principles advocated by Dieter Rams, Chief Design Officer at Braun from 1961 to 1995 – is that good design makes products unobtrusive and intuitively understandable. In other words, it has a paradoxical effect: the better the design, the less you notice the labour that has gone into it. The design team might be slogging away for years, discarding imperfect versions and bashing their brains to simplify the product. But when they succeed, they make us – the consumers – feel as if none of that ever happened. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some problems hide how tricky they are. So we forget how long it takes to get them right. We forget how much difficulty they exact &#8211; and tend to rush and get impatient when we stumble over them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to think hard not only about physics, but also about the big everyday challenges that trip us up: how to form stable relationships, how to master emotions, how to bring up children, how to find careers that can satisfy our talents, how to deal with the defensive member of our team&#8230; Each of these is a devilishly complicated matter, almost as hard as Einstein’s conundrums, but sadly for us, the difficulties get concealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1">We should ensure we have an accurate map of difficulty and won&#8217;t be undermined by the idea that certain troubles are unworthy of minute attention.</p>

<h6 class="p1">Engines Audi 3.2 V6 FSI</h6>
<p class="p1">This is one of the most efficient petrol engines ever constructed. The V6-FSI by Audi has gone into the new A5 generation of cars: it produces 199kW at 6500 rpm and torque of 330 Nm occurs around 4000rpm. Part of the reason that it is so efficient – and part of what makes us human beings comparatively inefficient – is that the V6-FSI has only <em><strong>one</strong></em> goal. And that goal is exceptionally clear: it has to propel a car along tarmac roads.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a general principle: no entity can be optimally efficient at <strong><em>more than one thing</em></strong>. A robot that has to both climb stairs and make pancakes will be far less efficient than two distinct machines each of which can focus exclusively on one task. The more limited the goals, the higher one’s chance of efficiency. A multipurpose machine – human or corporate – is always going to be less efficient than one which is dedicated to a single purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4018079840_74d09959c5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6980" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4018079840_74d09959c5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4018079840_74d09959c5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/biologycorner</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"> Knowing what we want this to do is half the battle</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike the V6 engine from Audi, our brains are not specifically designed or evolved to be maximally efficient at one thing. Instead, this cognitive and emotional machine is profoundly generalist – it comes moderately well equipped for a huge range of possible activities: to write a novel, spear a fish, bring up a child, drive very fast up Fifth Avenue, sit in the office all day, live in New Guinea, marry, plot an assassination, live in an ice cave, go into politics, stay single, or expand a small business into the Asia market. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Although focus is something we value, it isn’t &#8211; and can’t be &#8211; the only thing we care about. It has to be put into the mix with other concerns. We might well accept a measure of inefficiency – in professional and personal life – in exchange for diversity and less boredom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Focusing on one thing to the exclusion of all others has its costs, as anyone who has ever spoken to an athlete about extra-curricular issues tends to find out.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no such thing as work-life balance. Everything worth fighting for unbalances your life</span></h5>
<p class="p1">In short, we have to choose &#8211; but we rarely know if we have chosen wisely. This is the dilemma at the heart of Existentialism – a philosophy developed in Denmark in the 19th century, which drew compassionate and intelligent attention to the difficulties created for humans by having insufficient knowledge and time to make optimal choices.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kierkegaard.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6067" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kierkegaard.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="kierkegaard" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Søren Kierkegaard (1838)</h6>
<p class="p1">The great Existentialist Soren Kierkegaard wrestled all his life with the issue of who he should marry. For a time, he thought he’d found the answer: a young attractive woman called Regine Olsen. Regine rejected him for a while, then finally she accepted him, at which point he began to have doubts. The whole saga took up a good 10 years of his life and caused enormous damage on all sides.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The frustration led Kierkegaard to one of the most beautifully intemperate passages in his masterpiece <em>Either/Or</em>:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it&#8230; Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">The Existentialists offer us a useful corrective to the normal, pernicious view that choice might be easy. A Kierkegaardian approach should never be a first move, but once we&#8217;ve done our best to pick wisely, the philosophy usefully tempers the modern sentimental notion that we could potentially have it all and that perfect choice is within reach. That  you suffer from the agony of choice isn’t an anomaly. It’s one of the most interesting and predictable things about being alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine someone who is deeply efficient. Their life is full of the best sorts of habits. They always take a break on Wednesday afternoon (unless there’s a crisis) and play a game of tennis or go swimming. They always get to their desk by 8.30; they always send polite thank you messages when people have been especially helpful or made a big effort. They always take time to fix the main outline of a document before elaborating the details. They always read through messages to check for silly spelling or content errors before sending. They always file important documents as soon as they get them or as soon as they are finished with them. They have set days when they clean up all their files.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve got a tendency to see this as a personality type. We imagine this person who was always like this; that at kindergarten they always took their left shoe off before their right shoe; that they are maybe sometimes a bit admirable (their working life does seem more tranquil) but also somewhat freakish.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, human beings are generally very good at acquiring habits. It’s just that various cultural forces have conspired to make habit formation look like an unimpressive, unexciting undertaking. At times ‘habit’ has even seemed like a dirty word – the name of something a bit shameful, boring and pitiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The creature of habit is the man with his slippers by the fire puffing on a pipe, always reading the same pages of the newspaper, always switching on the television news at the same time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to get better at habit formation we need to… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Have a higher opinion of habits</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t regard habit as the closing of the prison house door, the dying of the daylight, the triumph of the average over the individual. Some habits are pitiful, it’s perfectly true. But the mere fact that something becomes routine, and therefore easy and reliable cannot itself be a bad thing. Ideally, habits are glamorous – if the habits themselves are beneficial ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Set a time</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic poet, Wordsworth, often wrote about the beauty of the moon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Lo! where the Moon along the sky </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Sails with her happy destiny; </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Oft is she hid from mortal eye </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Or dimly seen, </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">But when the clouds asunder fly </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">How bright her mien! </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wordsworth surely hoped that other people would share his experiences and look at the moon more often; that they too might one evening wander over the hillside (or walk round to the shops) and turn their eyes upwards and perhaps see the moon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Wordsworth couldn’t make us care about the moon in the long-term, because he didn’t take enough of an interest in habit-formation. He left our interest in the moon up to chance and the fleeting inclination of the individual.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6053" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Ryan Ozawa</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, Tsukimi, the Japanese ritual of moon-viewing, is scheduled to take place on specific dates: the 15th day of the eighth month and the 13th day of the ninth month (of the solar calendar). You don’t need to wait for the mood to take you; you don’t have to dip by chance into a book of poetry and find encouragement. The diary takes care of all this for you: you are supposed to take a careful look at the moon anyway. The approach sounds less romantic. But it is more aligned with the needs of human nature. The reality is that mostly we do need prompts and reminders to do things. And we should not feel awkward or ashamed about this. You set a date, write it in your diary. You make an appointment with the task. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we schedule occasions regularly enough, an activity becomes a habit. After six weeks or so, we stop having to look in the diary, we remember anyway. Each time (after that) it becomes easier, more natural to repeat, the firm of behaviour gets entrenched.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Someone checks up</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, habits are things we don’t need to make much of an effort around, they become second nature, we do them with hardly a thought. But getting there can involve a painful exercise of the will. We have to make ourselves do things against inner resistance. We have to force ourselves to get out of bed earlier or to work off-line. It’s tempting to give it a miss. It’s too much effort, usually at the very time one feels depleted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15266549241_42a88673bd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6932" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15266549241_42a88673bd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="15266549241_42a88673bd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/US Army Europe Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The military have long exploited the idea of being checked up on as part of habit formation. At first, when you might still be reluctant to iron your trousers and wish you could get away with not polishing your shoes very vigorously, someone quite hard to please is sent round to inspect. But it’s assumed that this won’t have to go on forever. Instead most people will internalise their ambitions. And so, years after they have moved on to civilian life, they will continue to wear trousers with precise creases and highly polished shoes. The mere fact of reporting to another person gives us the tiny, but necessary, boost of determination to stick with something at the moment when we are most vulnerable to giving up. And so the habit is given a little longer to take hold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to developing habits will look a little odd, but that’s OK… it’s a sign that we’re leaving behind some quite mistaken, but very widespread, views of how things get done. In a world in which inefficiency is the norm, to be an efficient person will involve learning some ways of behaving that seem pretty strange. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We find tasks irksome and frustrating – and so perform them less efficiently – when we think that we shouldn’t be doing them, that they are beneath us or a waste of our time and energy. But when a task has prestige and glamour, it’s easier to put more of ourselves into it.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that at times we feel irritated by, or maybe even a bit contemptuous of, routine, detail, and watching the clock. Our society has thrown up alarming numbers of examples of how all these things can crush the soul. There’s pedantry, conformism, just going through the motions, the person who is fussy and obsessed by the rules. So, it’s hardly surprising that we’ve raised a few collective monuments to those heroes (real and fictional) who break the rules, focus on the big picture and who never care about whether they are being efficient or meeting targets: Mick Jagger, Harry Potter, Kristen Stewart, Katniss Everdeen, Virginia Woolf…</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/643px-Woolf_by_Beresford_b-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6048" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/643px-Woolf_by_Beresford_b-2.jpg?resize=635%2C582" alt="643px-Woolf_by_Beresford_b (2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Virginia Woolf in 1902; photograph by George Charles Beresford</h6>
<p>One of the sources of inefficiency is the belief – buried somewhere in our brains – that routine, details and all the little tasks of organisation (the tidy drawers in the desk, not running out of post-it notes, keeping the address book up to the minute) is ignoble. There’s a tendency to feel that paying a lot of attention to such things is a sign of a lesser mind, that it’s what gets in the way of more important things being done.</p>
<p>We need a corrective. We need to remember than in truth, there have been some extremely interesting and inspiring people and objects tending in the opposite direction. The artist John Ruskin, for instance, was obsessed with the task of capturing every last detail of the feathers of a Kingfisher.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RuskinFeatherDrawings1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RuskinFeatherDrawings1.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="RuskinFeatherDrawings1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h6><strong><strong>John Ruskin, <em>Feather Studies</em></strong></strong></h6>
<p>It wasn’t that he lacked the imagination or the verve or the breadth of mind to concern himself with anything bigger. Ruskin thought that details were very important. It wasn’t a climb down to be attentive to minutiae. On the contrary, he believed that it was precisely in the details that beauty or greatness existed. He believed – as did Flaubert and Mies van der Rohe – that ‘God is in the details’. Ruskin didn’t think it was beneath him to take infinite pains to match colour tones or to check he’d got every last strand the right length.</p>
<p>Ruskin is offering a corrective – if we need it – to the low status that routine and details often have. People end up being sloppy, scattered and (hence) inefficient not because by nature they are incapable of keeping their desk tidy or sorting out their files, but because they have the belief that such things ‘don’t really matter’; that it is boring and humiliating to have to be concerned with them.</p>
<p>Sloppiness is one of the enemies of efficiency. And to fix it, we need to understand it. Its source isn’t laziness. It&#8217;s misplaced idealism: the belief that the important things don’t connect with the details; the conviction that concern with little things means you cannot be looking at the big ones too. So, rather than try to terrify ourselves into paying greater attention to the apparently small stuff, the better fix is to get a more accurate vision of things. And, with people like Ruskin or Mies van der Rohe as a guide, to re-glamourise the little tasks which turn out to be, in fact, crucial for efficiency.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Human beings are pathetically prone to distraction. It’s almost comically easy to get us to stop concentrating on anything even a tiny bit challenging and turn gratefully to something more immediately gratifying or interesting and almost certainly a lot less productive; like picking one’s nose, viewing porn, checking whether there’s a custard cream in the biscuit tin, seeing what’s happening to the Greek economy or the career of Jeremy Clarkson.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all suffer from distraction. But collectively we have been very reluctant to take serious steps to address it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do a <em>few things</em>, of course: like have open plan offices and KPIs which won’t be met unless a person keeps their capacity for distraction under some kind of control. All the same, distraction remains a scourge and undermines our productivity to an astonishing degree. Because when we really are in focus and in the mood and fired up, it’s amazing what we can achieve in a short time. And hence slightly shocking to imagine what one might be able to do were the attention not always wandering off. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Middle Ages, it was widely agreed that the most important thing to think about was God. Today, the thing we most have to focus attention on is usually work. But unlike in our own day, back in the Middle Ages, leading figures were prepared to accept that asking for prolonged<em> non-distracted</em> attention means making a huge and very difficult (but maybe very important) demand on the fragile and wayward human psyche. They were prepared to see just how big and difficult a demand this really was for creatures like us – more naturally interested in things like feasting, sex, scratching their bottoms, hunting and gambling, than in pondering the divine nature, examining our own failings or seeking to understand the meaning of some of the more obscure sections of the Bible. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They took very seriously the problem of getting people to pay attention to what they considered the important things – and stop getting distracted. And they realised that you might need to take some pretty drastic-looking steps to keep the mind in focus on the key things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One of the key moves they made was the invention of the Monastery. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia_complesso.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6938" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia_complesso.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia,_complesso" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Praglia Abbey</h6>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The monastery made a range of dazzling innovations in the field of non-distraction studies. For example, it proposed that to avoid distraction, one might need to live far removed from towns and cities. The architecture should be rather grand and imposing – as a continual reminder of the importance of what you are doing. One should live on-site and not commute in. The walls are going to have to be high and thick. There can’t be lots of doors or big picture windows looking out onto the wider world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Walls, cloisters and being a good few miles from the local tavernas certainly help in the fight against distraction;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but on their own, they are not enough. Medieval Christianity additionally developed <em>rules</em> about how to live in and use these buildings. One of the earliest and most influential rule-setters was a Roman nobleman living at the end of the 5th century, by the name of Benedict.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He founded a number of monasteries in Italy and he wrote an instruction manual for his followers, with a simple and emphatic title: <em>The Rule</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/738px-Fra_Angelico_031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/738px-Fra_Angelico_031.jpg?resize=635%2C647" alt="738px-Fra_Angelico_031" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Early anti-distraction guru</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rules were beautifully precise and detailed. They include thoughts on:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eating:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Rule 39: Except the sick who are very weak,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">let all abstain entirely</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">from eating the flesh of four-footed animals.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should consume modest, but nutritious, meals only twice a day (an occasional glass of wine is allowed). Lamb and beef are to be avoided. But chicken and fish in small quantities are helpful. During meals, people are not allowed to talk to one another. Instead they should listen to someone reading from an important and interesting book. If they need something they should make a signal with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Silence: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You need to be quiet quite a lot, and for this to be the norm. You are only allowed to talk in certain places and at certain times. Otherwise, keep quiet. When you do talk with others, gossip and malicious comments are strictly forbidden. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Hair and Clothing: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To avoid distraction you need to wear clothes that are basically the same as those of everyone else in the community. Something plain and useful. Not too expensive. Nothing to distract you there. Also, everyone must have their hair cut the same way – very very short. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Balance: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Rule 35: Let the brethren serve one another, </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">and let no one be excused from the kitchen service </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">except by reason of sickness </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are going to be concentrating quite a lot on ideas or intellectual activities you must take some physical activity everyday, something repetitive and soothing might be ideal: like sweeping the floor or weeding a row of lettuces. You must also occasionally take your turn preparing a meal or doing the washing up – everyone does. But mostly it will be other people’s turns so you’ll be free (and guilt free).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ordering the day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have to go to bed early and get up very early. Routine is crucial. You’ll be doing the same thing at the same time day after day. It will soon become a habit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Keep sex away</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone is to dress and behave in a demure way. No encouragement to be given to sexual feelings. Sex plays havoc with any attempts to concentrate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At many strategic points in the buildings, you’ll see beautiful or dramatic works of art that remind you of some important idea or help you get into a useful mood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SanMarco.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SanMarco.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="SanMarco" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">When you look up from your workstation – a reminder that suffering is an essential part of life </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we’re unlikely to be preoccupied with getting ourselves focused and distraction-free in the name of our relationship with God. It’s around work that this issue arises. Work is a hugely important theme in our lives and we’re expected (almost required) to spend years concentrating on writing reports or preparing accounts, pondering how best to give feedback or assessing the options for a new distribution terminal in Lancashire. We’ll manage it, but – as things stand – much much less efficiently that we ideally could. Much of the time we will be being paid to drag ourselves mentally back to the task in hand for another tiny burst before feeling the tug of a daydream, the speculation about where someone got their new shoes, the annoying way one’s hair is sticking up a bit on the left side, the decision about what kind of sandwiches to have for lunch… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a way to end the tragic dominance of distraction, we suggest a number of strategies, with the example of St Benedict in mind:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Office uniforms </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, elegant but modest enough to dampen down libidinous thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Physical exercise</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Integrate brief doses of gardening or maintenance work into the schedule of executives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Ban the internet</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its sounds prudish, naive or dated. But it’s really ambition for our lives that drives this kind of censorship; and the humiliating admission that generally we are a bit rubbish at self-control. We can’t spend the rest of our lives checking the <em>Mail Online</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Chatter</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Periods of silence and collective reading are to be encouraged and personal gossip banned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Architecture</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tranquil, grand; facilities for periods of live-in work. Fewer open plan offices. More cells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strategic reminders of the nobility of labour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to focus your mind on something serious and quite difficult, you’re probably going to have to take some quite radical steps to make this happen. You’re maybe going to have to look a bit weird and do things that will strike some people as rather odd. But that’s only because our society has not really admitted to itself how big a grip distraction actually has on us. </span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s natural to think that it must be a huge advantage for artists living in Paris to have the Louvre on their doorstep. All that inspiration. All that encouragement. They can drop in at any time and see the works of the greatest masters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> So, it can be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a bit of a shock to learn that quite a few of the most interesting artists have harboured very different feelings about the museum. Corot, Camille Pissarro, Apollinaire, Braque, Picasso, Gauguin, Léger, Duchamp:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>at various times in their lives they all expressed the same longing – to burn the place to the ground. They weren’t vandals or barbarians. They were just very alive to the way perfectly accomplished, majestic examples of art from the past stops you feeling creative confidence. The masterpieces make your own efforts look puny. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Think of a Bach concerto or the uncanny fit of words and music in Hey Jude; the white garden at Sissinghurst or the poetry of E. E. Cummings. These are some of the most prestigious, most loved, of all human creations. And yet, strangely, our admiration for them can be major impediments to ever ourselves reaching a good enough solution to the tasks we face in our own working lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagine you were really interested in painting, because you’d fallen in love with some of the works of Raphael.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/661px-Raffael_stcatherina.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6034" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/661px-Raffael_stcatherina.jpg?resize=635%2C543" alt="661px-Raffael_stcatherina" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">Raphael, <em>Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> (1507)</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might be keen to look at his paintings at every available opportunity, but doing so might be both thrilling and depressing. They are so gracious, so simple, so easy – every line is exactly as it should be. But then you think of your own very modest efforts. The smudges, the wobbly bits, the one that started as a portrait of your cat and that ended up as a picture of a storm cloud. You sit down to do a drawing after a visit to the National Gallery – and you feel paralysed. Whatever you do is sure to be wrong. Your love of the ideal has made it frightening and humiliating to do anything yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who don’t know where to start are often perfectionists. It’s an honourable problem: you’re doing nothing not because you’re lazy but because you’re very ambitious. Perfectionism is one of the causes of procrastination – because it makes us so worried about getting things wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In general, we can only start working when the fear of not doing anything finally exceeds the fear of doing it badly. So, if the fear of doing it badly is vast, we won’t do much. Or, one is left in the miserable situation of being forced to confront terrifying things simply because there’s something even more terrifying in the other direction (like bankruptcy or expulsion).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To loosen the paralysing grip of perfectionism – and liberate our productive energies and become more efficient – there are four things we can do (without having to resort to incendiary attacks on French cultural monuments). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">One: Visit the studio, not the gallery</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The gallery is where you can see the finished product. The studio is where you see the anguish, wrecked early versions, the ones with holes in them where the guy got so frustrated he kicked them and where there are watermarks on the paper where the artist broke down and wept.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you love Raphael and are trying to be a painter, don’t look just at the finished stuff, be sure to look at the sketches, which show all the effort that was required before perfection was anything like an option.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6035" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">Raphael, Head of Saint Catherine and sketches of cupids&#8217; (1507-8)</h6>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Buy a Korean moon jar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s very lovely. But it’s far from perfect. There are patches where something has gone wrong with the colour. The glaze hasn’t worked terribly well. If you look carefully, you’ll see all kinds of dents and bumps in the shape.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6942" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Flickr/Ashley Van Haeften</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The jar teaches us an important lesson: the imperfect can still be very good, noble and admirable. For something to be loved and valued, it really isn’t necessary for it to be perfect. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Contemplate Europa, the ice moon of jupiter</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Europa-moon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6037" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Europa-moon.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="Europa-moon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© NASA</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Europa is equidistant from Manchester, Nairobi and Moscow (it’s about 628 million km from each of them); it has a crust of water ice; it may have a core of nickel. It orbits Jupiter every three and a half days. If you lived on Europa, you would have 104 times as many birthdays as you do on planet earth. Not much happens on Europa. In 2007, a NASA space probe came within about 2 million kilometres.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>From the point of view of Europa, the exact quality of the report you are writing, the ideal order of the financial presentation, the brilliance (or lack of it) of the marketing campaign… none of these look very urgent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Investigate your worries exhaustively</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perfectionism gives rise to worries. If I make a start, I’ll make a mistake and then something terrible will happen. Inside one’s head there are half-formed fears which run along lines such as: If I don’t get the presentation exactly right, I might as well not have done it at all. If I don’t write the ideal report I’ll never make partner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take the fears very seriously, write them down. Investigate how much truth there is in them. Is it in fact true that the only possible way to become a partner in the firm is always to write perfect reports? Will you in fact be sacked if the presentation is merely quite good and not brilliant?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our minds are deeply irrational in the way they generate fears. Write down the litanies of terrors and then submit them to rational and benign scrutiny. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>I. Office Victorians</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In the 19th century, British explorers were famous for not getting stressed. They might &#8211; like David Livingstone in his travels in central Africa between 1851 and 1883 &#8211; get attacked by a lion, suffer pneumonia, see most of their companions die of malaria and dysentery &#8211; and yet remain calmly optimistic. Livingstone’s journal (written in berry juice when the ink ran out) isn’t a record of his gripes or personal anxieties. It’s filled with tranquil speculations about central African water-systems and careful observations about goat trading.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Rencontre_de_Livingstone_-_How_I_found_Livingstone_(fr).png?resize=688%2C427" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After going missing for several years, when Livingstone finally met up with his fellow explorer Henry Morton Stanley, there was no great show of emotion. For Victorian missionaries and explorers, stress was not an acceptable state of mind. One had to be positive and in control at all times.</p>
<p class="p1">This attitude didn’t disappear at the end of the 19th century. Of course, it is now quite unacceptable within relationships, but it flourishes in another major area of life: work. Modern business is full of people who deny their inner suffering &#8211; and who are, despite lots of surface differences and outward markers of casualness and openness, in their own way just as buttoned up as legendary Victorian explorers enduring the tropics in crisply-ironed khaki.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/457193030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6983" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/457193030.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="Simon Cowell : Photocall - MIPCOM 2014 In Cannes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Whatever the rhetoric, being tough is currently crucial at the office. There’s a prevalent and distinctly brutish idea at large that one should be hard to impress, harsh in identifying people’s defects and unmoved by failure in others and oneself: empathy for the weak is itself a fatal weakness.</p>
<p class="p1">Because self-doubt is taboo, it can be hard to recognise that it even exists. The world’s offices are full of people (let’s call them Office Victorians) who come across as unyielding and coldly confident, when the strange, underlying fact is that they are terrified &#8211; and yet they see business as too dangerous a place in which to own up to being afraid and in doubt. It takes a courage and a trust in one’s own authority which is easy to lack in order to admit that things may be spinning out of control. Far easier to settle into a composure of grim stolidity.</p>
<p class="p1">For those of us who have to work around Office Victorians, it is useful to know that outwardly very intimidating people might be scared, rather than mean. If we have to deal with their rigid certainties and barked orders, we shouldn’t respond to the iciness, but need to go beneath the surface behaviour in order to try to deal with the frightened child within. It will be tricky, though, because they’ll make that interpretation feel entirely inappropriate. That’s part of their self-defence.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Office Victorians give the impression that stress is something one should be ashamed of when in fact, real bravery involves a capacity to admit to worry and fragility.</p>
<p class="p1">Once one looks at the office as a place full of the walking wounded, there&#8217;s no shortage of evidence for how hard it is to cope. Someone who has been doing well in the company for a few years starts, perhaps quite suddenly, to be beset by large worries about the purpose of work, the direction of their career and the state of their relationships. They get very interested in travelling; they’re always checking up prices of flights to Istanbul or Airbnb options in Sao Paulo. They make some weird remarks: ‘We’re all going to die, so why are we worrying about the China market?’ They mention ‘the death of God’ at a meeting of regional sales reps. During a break in a planning session, while pouring a cup of coffee, they ask a colleague ‘Are you ever struck by the thought that it might have been better never to have been born?’ or ‘What do you think it would be like to be a cloud?’ On two Monday mornings in a row they come in looking haggard. Emerging from the lift, it looks as if they have been crying on the way up to the 15th floor. They look out of the window a lot. They are going through what might be called an ‘existential’ crisis – named in acknowledgment of the mid-twentieth Century French philosophers, the Existentialists, like Camus and Sartre, who were especially interested in the panicked feeling that one’s current life is meaningless.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Albert_Camus_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel_portrait_en_buste_posé_au_bureau_faisant_face_à_gauche_cigarette_de_tabagisme.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6000" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Albert_Camus_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel_portrait_en_buste_posé_au_bureau_faisant_face_à_gauche_cigarette_de_tabagisme.jpg?resize=438%2C368" alt="Albert_Camus,_gagnant_de_prix_Nobel,_portrait_en_buste,_posé_au_bureau,_faisant_face_à_gauche,_cigarette_de_tabagisme" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">Albert Camus, 1957</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first instinct would be to say that these are all signs of a bad employee. Their work is definitely suffering; other people are getting bothered. The company might start to think about how much it’s going to cost to let them go. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But management shouldn’t be scared. An existential crisis doesn&#8217;t mean someone is a bad employee (though something does need to be done). We need to give ourselves much less alarming accounts of what’s going on when an individual falls into a state where they are puzzled, angry, worried or unduly thoughtful about the purpose and direction of their life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going through such mental anguish from time to time, at least every few years, is a natural, even inevitable part of being human. You don’t get confused and troubled because you are misguided, weak-willed or selfish, but because you are complex, thoughtful, fragile and – like everyone – slightly broken.</span></p>
<p class="p1">At a collective level, we’ve given ourselves unfrightened accounts of what’s going on when teenagers sit moodily staring out of the window and can&#8217;t answer when someone asks them what is going on or requests them to pass the salt. We know these young people aren&#8217;t heading directly for a life of delinquency; we can stay confident that a reconciliation with the demands of the world will emerge.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/533076346_ef3273c830_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6986" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/533076346_ef3273c830_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="533076346_ef3273c830_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">We should expect analogous periods of confusion and loss of direction to punctuate the lives of every employee. We are not automatons, but highly complicated volatile collections of protein that need careful and sympathetic administering. The good, mature corporation makes room for the fact. They see their task not as that of shepherding an army of the mentally invulnerable, but rather of stopping periods of angst from turning into full-blown disasters.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of large companies now recognise the need for a gym. They realise there isn’t a conflict between health and working hard. Stretching your biceps of course doesn’t have direct, immediate pay offs for work. But there’s an acknowledged correlation between being a good employee and taking time to administer to the needs of the body.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6307273092_83c436a5ba_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6307273092_83c436a5ba_b.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="6307273092_83c436a5ba_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something similar must eventually develop around mental health. Setting up an employee gym for the mind, otherwise known as a therapy centre, wouldn&#8217;t directly close a deal or pep up a presentation. But it would signal that a company understands and affords legitimacy to the needs of the emotional self. We need companies that can calmly take on board the idea that total sanity won&#8217;t be possible for any of us all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>II. Sensitive Souls</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Human beings are astonishingly sensitive creatures. Our ears can pick up sounds between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz: which means anything from the rustling of a sheet of paper in the room next door to the minute sound of water dropping into a can five floors away. Our eyes are no less acute, with a capacity to detect a luminance range of 1014, or one hundred trillion (100,000,000,000,000) (about 46.5 f-stops), from 10−6 cd/m2. At the end of our fingertips are 2,500 receptors per cm2, ready to appreciate the contrast between Central American cotton (gossypium hirsutum) and its slightly smoother Egyptian cousin (gossypium herbaceum). As for the 40 million olfactory receptor neurons in our noses, they can distinguish between one trillion different odors. The memory storage capacity of our mind is no less prodigious: the brain contains one billion neurons, each of which makes around 1,000 connections with other neurons, resulting in a total network of a trillion connections. Our computers may be impressive, but our brains continue to be more so, for they can hold about 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes) of memory: which means that if it worked like a video recorder, you’d need to leave the TV on for 300 years to fill up your mind.</p>
<p class="p1">These capacities have been wonderful for politics, engineering, chemistry, biology &#8211; and especially for art, where the results of human sensitivity are perhaps easiest to notice and marvel at. Only an animal as well sensorily-well-equipped as we would have bothered to arrange the 10,000 pieces of coloured glass that go into the large rose window of Chartres cathedral.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://hearttoharp.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/chartreswindow.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="539" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Rose window in the Notre Dame cathedral, Paris</h6>
<p>Or would have been able to manipulate five different kinds of blue to produce an extraordinarily life-like sleeve, as Titian did:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wga.hu/art/t/tiziano/10/21/01bluesl.jpg?resize=456%2C559" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Titian&#8217;s Portrait of a Man</h6>
<p class="p1">Only an animal of dazzling neuronal complexity would be able to read (let alone write) a passage like the one below from Marcel Proust’s <i>In search of Lost Time</i>, where the central character, Swann, finds himself deeply moved by a piece of music:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>But tonight, at Mme. Verdurin’s, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend’s drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in </em><em>the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann’s features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown &#8211; and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil’s sonata for the piano and violin.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is the good side to being human. Unfortunately, we buy our sensitivity at a very high price. Our capacity to notice, remember and imagine so much is responsible both for the glories of civilization and for an awful lot of everyday frustration and stress.</p>
<p class="p1">Marcel Proust was driven almost to madness by his sensitivity. The writer Andre Gide once described him (with compassion) as ‘a man born without a skin.’ He was capable not only of arranging words with superlative grace on the page, but also of hearing noises three apartments below his (requiring him to line his bedroom with cork) and of suffering from a difference in altitude between Versailles and central Paris (83 meters).</p>
<p>Even when we’re not Proust, we notice rather too much. Moment by moment you might be aware of a sound in the next room, traffic outside (a car slowing down, another going over a speed hump, the tiny variation in sound as a vehicle turns a corner); you’re aware there’s a meeting coming up next month that needs special attention, that you’ve got to pick up the dry cleaning tomorrow; that you never heard back from X; that Y didn’t smile this morning; that the take-away coffee was a bit weak and your brain feels a touch slow; that’s there’s a slightly dry patch on the roof of your mouth, that your left shoulder feels tense, that you never heard back from Z, that there’s a package waiting for you at home, that you wish you don’t really like the shoes you are wearing … The list could be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="p1">Stress is the over-stimulation of the sensory apparatus. Because stress is so unpleasant, it’s tempting to hate ourselves for suffering from it and to see it as some form of unique curse or personal weakness. But at the level of our very organs, we are creatures fundamentally predisposed to over-stimulation. Stress is intimately bound up with our strengths, it’s a weakness related to our talents as a species. That we are prone to mania, can’t sleep, feel weary, crazy or burdened by strange thoughts is not unusual or motive-less: it’s a logical outcome of, and a heavy price we all have to pay for, our astonishing mental capacities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Of course we go to work for money and the people you meet can be great. But a lot of the time – though we might not quite put a finger on it exactly – we’re also looking for something else from our work: a sense of meaning.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we talk about jobs being meaningful or meaningless, we are at heart asking whether these jobs are helping anyone’s life to go better: we’re wondering whether our work stands a chance of increasing someone’s pleasure or reducing their suffering. Unlike what standard economics tells us, we’re desperate to make a significant contribution to the good. It’s hard to be happy at work without a sense that we’re helping others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4058808950_11be8e4061_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6944" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4058808950_11be8e4061_z.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="4058808950_11be8e4061_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The worry that work is not meaningful tends to announce itself in one of five main ways:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. My job feels meaningless because the products are trivial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘My job’s OK day-to-day, it’s interesting managing quite a big team. But in the end we’re only making paper clips. Nothing wrong with that. We do it really well. You’d be surprised by the size of the market. But speaking personally it somehow feels a bit trivial: if all goes well, I will have helped someone to keep their papers in order. I’ve been here five years. I sometimes wonder if I’m wasting my life.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. My job feels meaningless because I’m a tiny cog in a huge machine</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I don’t want to complain. I’m glad to have a job. We’re in biotech and maybe for the guys at the top and the researchers it’s all very worthy. But I’m not doing that. I’m just dealing with pay dates and when people are on leave. I also have to make sure there’s toner in the printers on the 9th floor and that we’ve practiced the fire drill according to the regulations. It gets me down to think there’s all these amazing things going on in the company and I’m not really part of it.’</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I work front of house in a really smart restaurant – you’d know the chef from television – and there are lots of things to love. But frankly a lot of the customers put me off. It’s depressing sometimes: they’re bitchy, often thinking you’ve ripped them off – and never ever say thanks. And quite often there are couples out for a big meal who seem so nasty and spoilt.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my bosses</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘In theory, management consultancy can sound pretty interesting. But I reckon (and please don’t tell anyone this) the people I work for are pretty cynical. They’re smarmy-polite around the big clients but, the moment they’re back in the office, they’re hard as nails. They’re always, always going on about the bottom line, and the return on capital.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. My job feels meaningless because any difference we make happens so slowly</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The company I’m with is one of the biggest on the planet: we’re literally, on every continent. People think that’s an exaggeration but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I mean I think we actually do have something around the Antarctic, though I don’t know exactly what it’s to do with. The scale of projects is massive but the pace is horrifyingly slow. Sometimes you work developing something for ten years (I did on the geothermals of a proposed pipeline) but day-to-day, it’s just mind-numbing. Nothing feels like it’s ever changing or improving. It’s hard to have to look forward to 2021. Will I even be alive?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some jobs might really just be a bit meaningless: they really don’t contribute to the good; like advertising fake remedies for minor ailments, or working out how to get low-income people to gamble more, or developing financial products that benefit the seller more than the buyer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a lot of jobs <em>feel</em> less meaningful than they really<em> are</em>. The work the person is doing does actually makes a real contribution to the good of humanity. Only the work doesn’t<em> feel</em> meaningful to that individual.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s our target here; and there are multiple solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>Solutions to the Sense of Work Meaninglessness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: My job feels meaningless because the products are trivial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Vermeerification</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many employees suffer from the feeling that their work is meaningless because, in their own eyes, what they do lacks glamour. Others, they think, are making components for rockets to go to Mars, but here they are figuring out how to make (marginal) improvements to the paper clip company’s tax position. In their view of the world, something else has glamour and what they’re involved in doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But glamour is a remarkably variable quality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5979" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project-2.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project (2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Johannes Vermeer,</span><em><span class="s1"> The Milkmaid </span></em><span class="s1">(1657-8)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is one of the treasures of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum. If it were ever on the market, the price tag would be astronomical. About five million people jostle for a place in front of it every year, in the belief they are admiring one of the great masterpieces of Western art. You could view it as an exercise in the crucial task of re-assigning glamour. When Vermeer painted it (probably around 1658), pouring milk was not a highly regarded occupation. But he saw things differently. The painting shows the dignity and honour that such a simple task had in his eyes. The activity, as described by the painter, is no longer lowly or trivial.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5980" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In another work, <em>The Little Street</em>, Vermeer pushes the same thought further. The supposedly minor activities (scrubbing the tiles, darning a sock, sweeping the gutter in the yard) are in fact ways in which something very important is accomplished. Such acts bring order and grace to the physical environment. We have many needs. A clean floor is one of them. Keeping papers neat is another. Many different things in life have to be attended to for things to be okay overall, and each one is therefore connected up to the grander projects of existence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3674965537_a242e05511_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6946" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3674965537_a242e05511_b.jpg?resize=635%2C599" alt="3674965537_a242e05511_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are companies that need to get artful, to unlock their employees’ appreciation of the real worth – and hence meaningfulness – of what they do. Vermeer himself is a voice from the past, saying something important in the terms that made most sense in his own day. We could do with some corporate Vermeers to bring the message up to date – and it might be paper clips, rather than jugs of milk that they focus on first. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: My job feels meaningless because I’m a tiny cog in a huge machine</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: The Novel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some enemies of seeing ‘meaning’ that have arisen because of the sheer scale of businesses in modern capitalism. Corporations coordinate the labours of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of people – and raise productivity exponentially. But extreme specialisation and global reach can gravely reduce the sense of meaning that any one employee might have. A packaging supervisor in Malmo might not have much idea of how their work fits in with the activities of a geochemist in Ghana who compares activated alumina with indigenous laterite and bauxite as potential sorbents for removing fluoride from drinking water or with the concerns of a legal expert currently staying in the Alvear Hotel in Buenos Aires and reporting to a steering committee in New York about the implications of proposed revisions to Section 14 of the Argentine Mining Code. And yet all these individuals might be working for the same rather noble cause. Just none of them can quite remember day-to-day what the real cause actually is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems fiendish, trying to get people to see where they fit into the whole – and hence to feel how their work is meaningful. But in fact we have a lot of cultural experience around addressing similar kinds of problem. From the middle of the 19th century, novelists started experimenting with the idea of weaving multiple plot lines together. This reached its maturity around the late 1970s in the genre of the spy story.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/john-le-carre.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5982" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/john-le-carre.jpg?resize=635%2C559" alt="John Le Carre" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Le Carré, in the year he perfected the art of coordinating multiple plot lines</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, hypothetically, one chapter of a novel about a company might open with a description of someone accessing a bank account in Salzburg. The next thing, we’re in a restaurant in the Wan Chai District of Hong Kong where a deal is being hammered out to transfer packing crates to Dubai. Then the focus is on a meeting taking place in a basement in Whitehall concerning regulations for consumer goods. But rather than being a hopeless confusion, the point of the novel would eventually be to reveal how all of these apparently random events are in fact profoundly interconnected – and pointing to a rather grand goal. They are all manifestations of one intention: to create a new IT system for an office in Munich, say, or to increase the flow rate of a pump production line in southern Spain. Once scattered events are weaved together into a story, they can start to feel very meaningful indeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, every large company needs to deploy the resources of narrative: they need their own version of the spy story to tie elements together and should, perhaps, have some novelists on their payroll. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my customers</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Intrinsic Value</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/display_image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/display_image.jpg?resize=635%2C642" alt="display_image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, <em>The Convalescent’s Meal (</em>1747) </span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all we know, the poorly individual whose lunch is being so devotedly-prepared is a crabby, opinionated husband. Or maybe they’re a very frustrated adolescent given to taking out their anger at being cooped up in bed on the only person around to dump it on. Or it’s maybe a rich employer with a painfully over-developed sense of entitlement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in Chardin’s eyes, it seems, none of this matters too much. The woman isn’t simply doing this for the other person. She’s shelling the hard boiled carefully because she likes to do things well. If there were a little bit of the shell left, she’d feel that wasn’t right. She loves the perfect, glistening shape; she’s absorbed in her work and focused on doing everything as well as she can, making sure everything is perfect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s learned a vital trick. Even if the other person – the customer, in effect – doesn’t appreciate what she’s doing, she sees its worth. She’s doesn’t have to depend on the approval of another person to respect her own values and to want very ardently to live up to them. She likes things done a certain way, and doesn’t need a cheering gallery to support her. You can also tell her values from the well-polished little cup, the perfectly baked loaf of bread, and the neatness of her apron. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This strength of character can translate into commercial situations. The customers (perhaps it’s an airline or a hotel, a clothing chain or a spa) may be silent, preoccupied, undemonstrative or just rude. But they are turning up all the same; however imperfect their manners, they are actually paying. It’s the culture of the business that must compensate for their churlishness. It can adopt a Chardin-like perspective, which means setting the feeling of the worth of an activity free from the response of the customers. Self-respect takes the place of adulation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When hatred of customers threatens motivation, another avenue of progress lies in the direction of curiosity. It’s easy to hate customers. Those being served are often richer than those doing the serving. It can hence be hard for the person making the bed, or bringing the sole dauphinoise from the kitchen to the table, or fitting a pair of shoes that would cost a fortnight of their own wages, to feel much sense that they are contributing to the good of humanity by attending to these particular spoilt brats they are in charge of. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, though, we tend to know little of the lives of others. What we see on the surface might be wildly misleading. The boorish, apparently ungrateful tourist at the luxury hotel may have built their wealth through unremitting devotion for two and a half decades to providing used cars at the fairest prices to people in the south-western suburbs of Minneapolis. They’re maybe terrible at showing gratitude to a chambermaid or the concierge, but they’re truly excellent in many other (though currently invisible) ways, which you’d grasp very quickly if you met them in another context: looking for a reliable 2008 Dodge Stratus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the hotel, the restaurant or the shoe shop you’re seeing only a fraction of the individual. That fraction might not be too lovely. But it really isn’t a guide to the whole person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my bosses</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Upward Imagination</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to hate one’s boss. But the real challenge, which may also help one to regain motivation, is to try to imagine what it is like to be the boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WP3.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5984" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WP3.jpeg?resize=635%2C357" alt="WP3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">War and Peace</span></em><span class="s1">: The externals have changed, but the account of the mind of the boss is still useful</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the problem comes down to the fact that our culture is a bit short on realistic, sensitive descriptions of bosses, and of people in positions of authority generally. A big exception, however, is Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em>, first published in 1869. Tolstoy was hugely interested in what it’s like to be in charge. In the novel, the junior characters are always going on about how stupid the people in power are. A lot of blame circulates. Then Tolstoy takes us into the some of the grim decision-making situations that people in power actually face. It’s 1812, Napoleon’s armies have swept through Russia, they’re within striking distance of Moscow. It’s unthinkable, surely, that the enemy should take that city, the emotional heartland of the nation. The commander of the army – Kutuzov – has to decide whether to preserve the army or preserve the city. He makes a swift, brutal and totally right decision. Save the army. Kutuzov isn’t very nice in the standard ways. Tolstoy is careful to let us see this. But he attains a certain dignity nevertheless, once you can see that he stands in a terrifying place and has to face some very big, fearful issues, as many bosses do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often enough, the feeling that it’s meaningless to work for someone results from a misunderstanding as to why they act as they do: why they are short-tempered, in a hurry, preoccupied, gloomy and tricky to be around. Each company needs its own local version of Tolstoy who can more sympathetically take the employees into the mind of the boss, so that motivation is not lost through sheer incomprehension of what life might be like through someone else’s eyes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: My job is meaningless because any difference happens so slowly</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: The Lessons of History </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People want to feel that they are progressing the world. That’s understandable. But quite often, in fact, what they are doing is indeed contributing to the betterment of the world. It’s just going to take a very very long time. Day-to-day, it won’t feel like much progress is being made – and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>yet it is, just bit by bit, extremely slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_28th_July_1830_-_WGA6177.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5985" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_28th_July_1830_-_WGA6177.jpg?resize=635%2C523" alt="Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_(28th_July_1830)_-_WGA6177" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Such images feed a sense of frustrated impatience – and hence make work feel less meaningful than it is</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1830, the French painter Eugene Delacroix produced an amazing image of radical action: the good guys storm forwards, the enemies of progress are swept aside (some of them die), the new world is being born. Sunlight breaks through the clouds. This is the extreme version of a dominant idea of what it means to change stuff: namely, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>you’ll feel the difference right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately – though it’s a great painting – it’s also emotional propaganda for a very misleading vision of how good change actually comes about. It makes us more impatient than we should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we look on a big scale, it’s obvious that the world changes – and frequently improves. But this is only apparent when the time frame is sufficiently wide. Year by year, it might seem as if nothing is going right or that things are actually going backwards. This is the problem faced by politicians, the medical community and many companies too: they are doing good, but those who depend on them can’t see the change in a sufficiently speedy and hence meaning-laden way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9488_1353212751_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5986" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9488_1353212751_3.jpg?resize=635%2C463" alt="9488_1353212751_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A reminder that progress is slow, messy, imperfect – and real</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1848, the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, published a <em>History of England</em>, surveying the events of the previous century and a half. He came, eventually, to the reassuring conclusion that ‘The history of the United Kingdom during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.’ He wasn’t in the least ignoring the facts that in that time there had been two major rebellions in 1715 and 1745, a disastrous (from the English point of view) conflict with the US, a long and terrifying war with Napoleon, major religious riots and a transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy that had exacted an appalling human cost. All he meant was that despite these grave matters, genuine progress had been made. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a theory of good development that teaches us an important lesson in patience. And also in gradual accumulation. The big benefits to a nation (and by implication a company or individual) may not come about via any single grand event, like the storming of the Bastille. In England’s history, there was a piece of legislation here, an improvement in productivity there, a school was built in Chester, a road was resurfaced in Northumberland, pipes were laid to improve the water supply in Plymouth: thousands of individually relatively minor activities connected together over time gradually added up to momentous transformation. But on the ground at any particular moment it probably wouldn’t have felt as if much real progress was being made. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What Macaulay did was to trace the benefits of cumulative effect. It’s a crucial move that all companies should learn from if they wish to keep their more impatient and Romantic employees on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically management might see the ‘meaning’ of any particular job in terms of its contribution to the overall financial success of the company. That, after all, is ultimately how the position is justified and why it is worth employing someone to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this rationale does not connect with the human experience of meaning. Hardly anyone can find their work meaningful because it secures a marginally superior rate of return on capital to the shareholders than they could obtain from a rival investment. It is indeed essential to a corporation to achieve this, otherwise they will eventually go out of business, but the financial success of a company is always quite distant from the concerns of the average employee. It happens somewhere very far away. Of course, theoretically they know perfectly well that their work depends on the economic health of the enterprise. Only it’s not a big personal motive. It’s in the day-to-day experience that a job feels meaningful – or not. And this is a huge matter. Because the sense of meaning is one of the things that determines the greatest issue of all: how hard and well people will work.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In certain companies and offices around the world, there is a crisis of motivation. You know the sort of thing: in a brainstorming session, a key member of the team tunes out. They have a half-formed suggestion, which might actually be very interesting, but they don’t push themselves and let it drop. In another department, there’s an employee who seems to be sick quite often; they’re within their rights and there’s always a valid medical reason, but the manager knows that, in truth, a more devoted worker would be coming in. Across the organisation, there’s a culture of living for the weekend. It seems everyone might be a little on the look-out to leave – if only they can get a better offer. People check LinkedIn a lot. A really great guy went to a rival firm last month.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5959" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="5380585665_72842b37ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Baltic Development Forum</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number of reasons why workers lose motivation, but a central one, one of the most important, comes down to the feeling of not being valued. Gratitude might sound like a small thing, a little add-on with no seismic role to play in the fortunes of companies, but its absence in sufficient doses between layers of the managers and the managed can be responsible for extreme declines in productivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people don’t feel valued they stop putting forward their best efforts. They won’t rack their brains for a slightly better solution or neater deal. At parties, they take revenge: they enjoy spreading unattractive gossip about the firm. These things cost – a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversely, there are enormous gains in productivity to be found when people do feel that their work and contribution are being truly appreciated. In <em>The Oath of the Horatii</em>, the 18th century French painter David, captures the energy of loyalty based on love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/swords.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5960" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/swords.jpg?resize=690%2C358" alt="swords" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The employees get fired up for the next financial year</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The three brothers vow to give their lives – if need be – to save the city of ancient Rome, because they know their father (who holds the swords in the middle of the picture) wants them to – and they love and revere him. It’s amazing what people will do, if they really like you and want to deserve your gratitude. It’s what bosses often don’t understand; they’ve noticed how fear can get people moving. They’ve not yet grasped how much further and faster gratitude can drive us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Etty_Parting_1827.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5961" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Etty_Parting_1827.jpg?resize=635%2C639" alt="Etty_Parting_1827" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Leander swims over the Hellespont to meet his mistress Hero</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ancient world was captivated by the story of Leander. He was so devoted to his confusingly-named girlfriend, Hero, that he used to swim a couple of miles each night across the choppy waters of the Hellespont – now more familiar as the Dardanelles – to be with her. The myth has a tragic end: one night Leander is caught up in a storm and drowns. But his strenuous efforts to be with the one he loves speaks of the commanding power of devotion: we will push ourselves intensely in the service of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tantalising to think how such potential could be harnessed in other areas of life. Every evening, Hero would light a lamp on her side of the straits to guide Leander. Might there be equivalents, other ‘lamps’ in the world of work, that could lead and spur the imagination?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The failure to offer gratitude (and therefore a root cause of the loss of motivation) can be traced back to a number of false beliefs in the minds of management. Here are just a few:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. ‘Money should be enough’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The standard view is that what makes a person feel valued is the size of their salary. This is of course (confusingly) partly true, but we know in other areas of life that money only goes so far. While money – or gifts – are always welcome, we generally badly want to be valued in many other ways as well. The very notion that <em>simply</em> paying people ought to be enough has a habit of making them feel insulted, <em>not</em> valued, for it suggests that one only considers them as cash-maximising creatures, which is – </span>in its own way – a slur.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’d only imagine that someone’s good will could be bought<em> purely</em> for cash if you weren’t really interested in them. We grasp this point intuitively in families. A father who buys his child lots of expensive gifts, but doesn’t otherwise interact with them very much, isn’t building a strong relationship with them. In later years, the neglected party will say things like: ‘Dad was never around; he bought me a bike – it was a great bike, cost a fortune – but he never taught me to ride. He wasn’t there when I fell off, he never saw me do a wheelie down Glenorchy Avenue. I suppose in his way he loved me, but I didn’t feel it. We hardly talk now.’ The insult lies in the father’s assumption that the bike (and lots of other gifts) could be enough. He didn’t acknowledge how much else a child would need from him.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can sound weird to say that employees might need to offer love. But it’s a theory we’ve been rehearsing in relation to children for at least half a century. This photo of David Cameron walking his daughter Florence to school in London show how far we’ve come – at least in relation to parenting – in grasping how important quality of attention is. Prior to the 21st century, such scenes would have been unthinkable. An image of the most powerful person in the country clutching a doll would have been (in 1873 or 1961) enough to swamp a career in ridicule. There was simply, until recently, no recognition of why this might be a really good thing to do. A father with a big job would have felt that in <em>paying </em> for everything, he was doing all that was necessary. ‘I’m paying the school fees, the doctor&#8217;s bill, for the house and the holiday. Why should I pick up their doll?’ he might say. But today, we understand that Cameron is doing the school run because he knows that it is very significant for Florence to see that as well as being a grown-up, he’s fully alive to her world and her needs. The doll is important to her and so it’s important to him too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to understand that in order to help children develop well, we need to be sweet and understanding, patient and playful. We’re alive to how much of a difference this makes. The child who has been met with loving kindness will, we know, develop very differently than if they had always been treated sternly, constantly upbraided and criticised. In parenting we’ve learned to see the extraordinary potential unlocked in a person by love. The rare adult who now thinks this is a load of sentimental nonsense isn’t admired for their focus on practicality; they are regarded as dangerously out of touch with the smart reality of how one gets children to turn out reasonably well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A comparable revolution awaits in business. What we’ve learned in parenting hasn’t yet been properly absorbed in commercial life. It can still feel as if toughness is a mark of practical efficiency and that to deploy emotional intelligence is an unhelpful luxury. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. ‘Fear is better than Love when managing people’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s an old debate, dating back at least to Ancient Rome, about whether it is better to govern with love or with fear. Notice the either/or structure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evidently, there are many occasions where it’s necessary to be dissatisfied with the work or efforts of particular people. Not being grateful can be a productive way of signalling that something isn’t good enough yet. If we were permanently grateful, nothing could get better. Too much praise – that is, praise given too quickly or accorded too easily makes a person think that they’re good enough when they’re not. That isn’t kind either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niccolò Machiavelli, a Florentine bureaucrat and author of <em>The Prince</em> (1513) is the man who comes to mind at such moments. He rigorously argued for a dark truth: that people are by nature lazy and cowardly, and that in order to be an effective leader, one should be feared rather than loved. Only terror works.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5963" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg?resize=635%2C622" alt="Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Santi di Tito,</span><em><span class="s1"> Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli</span></em></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there’s a strain of devil’s-advocacy in this thinking that is in danger of blinding us to an obvious, but often neglected, truth: that there’s a clear need to play two cards: the card of love and the card of fear. Discussing the importance of the love card – gratitude, appreciation, niceness – doesn’t entail that the fear card is irrelevant, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many managers fail to hold on to the nuance, as if the choice were about being either always nice or permanently in tough mode. The trick is to develop a style of love that is driven by values; a love that is properly and appropriately <strong><em>conditional</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Western culture, we distinguish between two ways of thinking about love. Firstly, there’s <strong>unconditional</strong> love, best exemplified by Jesus’s parable of the prodigal son.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5964" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C555" alt="785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Rembrandt van Rijn,<em> Return of the Prodigal Son </em></h6>
<p class="p1">The son has been a complete wastrel. He took his father’s cash, ran off and spent the lot on wine, women and song. He ended up with a terrible job. Then he decided to head back home. What does his father do? Greets him with open arms and ‘kills the fatted calf’ (the story is told in Luke’s Gospel 15:29–30) to illustrate the idea of unconditional love: &#8216;it doesn’t matter what you do, how far you stray, I will always love you and be here for you&#8217;. It’s something that parents do at times feel for their children. It can be an immensely moving idea. But understandably one might be very sceptical of its relevance to business. It’s almost exactly what one can’t have. A business does not exist anywhere on earth that might say: ‘So, you blew that account, the contract you designed was a disaster for the firm, you did the opposite of what you were asked to do and we lost that client: but come home, we love you just the same&#8230;’</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are, fortunately, other, more useful theories of love around. The one we should look to is called <em><strong>philosophical</strong></em>  because it was first defined by the Greek philosopher Plato. This idea is that love, properly understood, must be conditional. It says: ‘Love is admiration for what is good. It is not, and can never be, personal. It is related to qualities and actions. I will therefore love you if you are good, but only if you are good’. In this view, love is closely connected to admiration. You love what’s worthy in another person – and therefore you are disappointed when they don’t live up to their capacities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Apollo_of_the_Belvedere.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5965" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Apollo_of_the_Belvedere.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="Apollo_of_the_Belvedere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">Apollo Belvedere ca. 120–140 CE</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The choice doesn’t have to be between Machiavellian fear and Christian love. The answer lies in holding to a conditional, philosophical theory of love: a love that adequately identifies and then rewards the good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. ‘I don’t have time to be grateful’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another major reason people aren’t more grateful is a fear of how long it might take to be grateful – and an anxiety about what sort of relationship and expectations might be built up if one were, on occasion, to be a little more relaxed. Gratitude can seem painfully at odds with getting things done. A manager might worry that by showing gratitude, they’ll become a chum, rather than the boss. It might feel nice for a little while, but then there’ll come a point when they need to crack the whip and they’ll find it doesn’t work anymore: ‘If I’m grateful I’ll be entering a sticky relationship – I’ll be invited to their cousin’s wedding and then have to find a way of refusing politely. If I ask about the child once, I’ll have to ask every time. That might end up being three hours, accumulated over a year.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We normally experience kindness as meaning a commitment to someone for a long time. A related point can be seen in the history of philosophy. It’s tempting to think that a serious idea needs a very long book. But, actually, that’s not true. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of the French philosopher, La Rochefoucauld (born in Paris in 1613), who wrote a very slim book, barely 60 pages long, that can deservedly be counted as one of the true masterpieces of philosophy. It’s a compendium of acerbic, melancholy observations about the human condition, each of them only a sentence or two long: ‘We all have strength enough to bear the misfortunes of others.’ ‘Some people would never have fallen in love if they hadn’t heard there was such a thing&#8230;’ etc. These gems say in a sentence what others have needed whole books for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This matters because there are related techniques for social brevity. At the heart of good social brevity is psychological accuracy. Brevity is fine (it doesn’t feel brusque or dismissive) when appreciation is accurate; just as La Rochefoucauld’s observations don’t feel flimsy just on the basis of their length. A good compliment latches on to the true goodness of a person or the worth of their effort. The key to brevity is accurate insight. You have to get used to asking yourself about the actual roots of your satisfaction with what someone has done. What is it, in fact, that especially deserves appreciation? You don’t need to go to the pub and spend an hour and a half to convey gratitude convincingly. You need to think hard and fast – and deliver a big-hearted compliment with the rapier-like deftness of a great French aphorist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. ‘I’m too worried to stop and pay compliments’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is often at the root cause of a lack of gratitude. By definition, a manager is frequently overseeing a wide range of tasks. The individual worker is only doing one bit of a picture whose full expanse they might not be able to see. To the worker, their own effort is a big thing. To the manager, it’s a small thing in relation to the big picture of the needs of the organisation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DT1995.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5967" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DT1995.jpg?resize=635%2C518" alt="DT1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marie-Guillemine Benoist,</span><em><span class="s1"> Madame Philippe Panon Desbassayns de Richemont and Her Son Eugene</span></em><span class="s1"> (1802)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We get this intuitively when it comes to parents and children. The parent has to worry about so many things that the child can’t begin to grasp but which are hugely relevant to the child’s well being (it’s one of the things that makes pictures of mothers and children so poignant). The parent needs to keep their mind on issues like: How will I ensure my child gets a good education? What if there’s a banking collapse and we lose our savings? Can we actually afford to stay in the house we’re in or should we be cutting back and moving somewhere more affordable? What if the political situation worsens, will we need to leave the country? And yet all the child is focused on is: does anyone here like my drawing? Isn’t it amazing I did well in the geography test? I don’t want to write thank you letters!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In business there is necessarily some version of this. The manager inevitably has an eye on the bigger picture in a way that can’t normally be the case for most employees. This means that often they feel simply too burdened to have much emotional bandwidth left over to consider generously the needs and achievements of others. It’s totally understandable. But truly magnanimous people manage to keep their own (perhaps very serious) worries at bay for long enough to be gracious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An instance of this can be found – perhaps unexpectedly – in the life of Margaret Thatcher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_Iron_Lady_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5968" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_Iron_Lady_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition.jpg?resize=635%2C544" alt="708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_'Iron_Lady'_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not necessary to be sympathetic politically to Mrs Thatcher to admire her ability to bracket anxiety</span></p>
<p class="p1">In 1979, not long after she had become Prime Minister, she was hosting a dinner at Chequers, her official country house, when a hapless waitress managed to drop a bowl of soup into the lap of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone must have been expecting the forceful, driven, perfectionist Prime Minister to turn furiously on the mortified waitress. But instead, Mrs Thatcher jumped up to console the distraught young woman: ‘There, there,’ she said, ‘you musn’t be upset’. From the height of power, she entered for a moment into the the reality of what this mishap must have meant in the life of someone vulnerable and of no consequence in the public life of the nation.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a crucial capacity at work, here: the ability to bracket anxiety. Obviously, Mrs. Thatcher had a thousand major concerns on her mind: she was trying to reform industrial relations, control inflation, increase GDP, fight off critics in her own party (to commence the list). In such a situation, anyone could have been forgiven for blowing their top, as most of us often do (you are harassed at work and some clown goes and sets off the fire alarm by mistake. You want to have them hung drawn and quartered). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ungrateful-seeming person is at heart, often just a very worried person. They don’t feel they’ve got enough time to pause and enter into someone else’s life. They can’t afford to be nice. The fact is though that, really, they – and we – all do&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. I don’t see that there’s anything in particular to be grateful for…’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s extremely easy to lose sight of the pains – and indeed the efforts – of others. We see this most clearly in the way we respond to information in the news media. It’s incredibly easy for the lives of other people to disappear into abstractions. For example, theoretically, we know quite well that there is something called poverty in China. And we realise that many children in all countries have hard lives. But, if we’re honest, we have to admit that mostly we’re not moved by these abstract facts. We don’t really take it in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why this thing we call ‘art’ can be especially helpful. Art can take us into the experience of other people and transform a statistic into something that moves us. Take these photographs of one poor single father’s struggle to bring up his young son in Wenzhou, China.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yuan Zhouming makes a meagre living polishing people’s shoes twelve hours a day on the streets of Wenzhou, a large city in south-east China. His wife ran off a few years ago, so he takes his four-year-old son around with him while he’s working. The little boy used to beg for food, dart into the road, and sometimes try to steal things from passers by. So the father has taken to tethering him with a rope to keep him out of mischief. He lives his childhood on a tiny patch of pavement. It’s not cruelty, it’s desperation. The father just can’t do his job and keep an eye on Yuan Wang at the same time. At night, they go home to a single squalid basement room. The boy has a teddy bear – his one comfort.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lesson that can be drawn from this has applications (though usually of a less dramatic kind) in business. Everyday we’re side by side with people, but we encounter only very particular aspects of who they are. They get simplified into a few basic facts: ‘the girl who lives in Croydon with nice hair who put me down in a meeting last week’ or ‘the guy from sales with funny ears’. The bigger truths about who they are remain hidden: the patience with a troubled younger brother, the still-broken heart from a relationship that capsized four months ago; the prized collection of copper saucepans; the way they are haunted by memory of evenings on Playa Ancha beach and the sun going down over Valparaiso Bay. </span></p>
<p class="p1">These aren&#8217;t minor matters, because getting the best out of a person requires understanding what can move them, inspire them, touch their ambitions and imagination. Being appreciated as the person one really is is a huge matter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                                ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what can we do? Gratitude – like a sense of humour – isn’t something we normally think about <em>learning</em> in a systematic deliberate way. We’d more likely imagine it as just something some people have a knack for and others don’t. But in fact, as we’re coming to see, skills in this area are not simply a matter of luck. They depend on an unfamiliar muscle, which it might at first feel quite odd to flex deliberately, but which we should take care to exercise on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start to develop this gratitude muscle, we might begin quite far away from the usual concerns of business. We can tap into an elemental idea of gratitude, first developed by a 17th-century Japanese Buddhist monk and poet called Matsuo Bashō. Bashō was interested in teaching his followers how to nurture their capacity to appreciate everything around them. There are times when, under the influence of certain pieces of poetry or works of art, one may leave one’s ego and anxieties behind, and look at oneself and others from a very unusual perspective: as if one was not oneself. One can float free of concerns and start to identify with things which we normally pay little attention to. One starts to notice the breeze, the softness of the grass underfoot, moisture in the air, one’s own breath, the sound of a bell ringing far away, a bird on a tree through the window… One can become in the imagination a rock, water, the stars, leading one to an enlightened frame of mind known as <em>muga</em>, or a loss-of-awareness-of-oneself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jd_big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5971" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/jd_big.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="jd_big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">&#8216;Hibiscus with Haiku&#8217;</span></em><span class="s1"> by Bashō</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō’s aim wasn’t just to liberate us from the burden of being ourselves: it was to initiate a distinctive state of mind where gratitude would be easier, as would kindness and empathy. Thanks to this distinctive spiritual practice, one might end up feeling grateful for often unnoticed things like: rain, trees, clouds, a bowl of rice or a helpful hand from a colleague.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moments of heightened appreciation reveal – if nothing else – that our ‘gratitude meter’ is quite a variable instrument that we tone down and up. Sometimes we may feel gratitude for the existence of a small plant; at other times we’re hugely irritated by sporadic wifi coverage while touring Dartmouth National Park. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting better at appreciating things which we tend to take for granted is one of the big themes of art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8ad683c639407383f3c0a214771be5af.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5972" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/8ad683c639407383f3c0a214771be5af.jpg?resize=635%2C627" alt="8ad683c639407383f3c0a214771be5af" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adriaen Coorte,</span><em><span class="s1"> Strawberries </span></em><span class="s1">(1696)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, we already think that strawberries are nice. But the Dutch 17th-century artist Adriaen Coorte has made a monument to them. He wants to resensitise us to their extraordinary beauty. He’s reminding us that we love an aspect of the world more than we thought, and that there are things we took for granted. He’s looking at strawberries like an appreciative extra-terrestrial, re-finding a sense of wonder and encouraging us to do the same. The artist knows something crucial about us: how familiarity dulls our appreciation of what is on offer. By inviting us to concentrate just for a minute or two he can refresh our curiosity about, and engagement with, life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to do with many other things what Adriaen Coorte did with strawberries. Starting with some of our colleagues. In the spirit of Coorte and Bashō, we might try out a few Gratitude Muscle Exercises: we could begin by trying to imagine a day in the life of an office chair. Then, setting aside our preoccupation with ourselves, we could try to describe a day as it might seem through the eyes of a colleague (no names needed) that we don’t like very much: we’d imagine what it might be like to be them brushing their teeth or, on the way to the bus stop, speaking to their mother on the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                             ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In essence, gratitude is hugely important but currently lacks prestige. People say: ‘I don’t have time to write the report or go to the meeting’. They never say: ‘I don’t have time to sit and chat with my workers, or to make them feel appreciated’. That’s because we have a picture of how a report and meeting contribute to the overall economic performance of a business but, as yet, we don’t properly recognise the role gratitude can play in the success of a company. We don’t see it as the key that unlocks motivation and great performance. Getting gratitude right deserves to be recognised as one of the great arts of management, something that might just get people to swim the Hellespont for you.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Lloyd died recently at 51 from cancer. She liked drinking coffee so much her family decided to commission a coffin for her with the name of her favourite chain on the side.</p>
<p>It was a moving, sweetly eccentric gesture. We don’t typically think of corporations as claiming or deserving that kind of place in our lives. Karen’s loyalty, even love, for a brand is extremely unusual.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5946" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinA.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="PM-210214-coffinA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Mostly, we just tolerate the companies who provide the fabric of our lives: phones and shoes, flights, groceries, insurance, trousers, electricity. One might be a bit better than another, offer attractive deals or provide decent service. But this is miles away from deep admiration or love.</p>
<p>We’ve come to think that that’s exactly how things should be. It’s normal to think that if you’re keeping your wits about you, you should be a touch cynical about and detached from the corporate world. Which is why Karen’s funeral has come to wider attention.</p>
<p>Companies sometimes like to talk in terms of love and big missions; but they never quite convince us when they do. It’s easy to satirise their efforts. The slogans are neat (‘We try harder’, ‘Just do it’, ‘I’m lovin’ it…’), but we’re all world-weary enough to shrug our shoulders and walk past with wry disregard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, most corporations don’t deserve our deep admiration – and they don’t get it either. But at various times, we can catch glimpses of how it could be very different. In 1895, it wouldn’t have been at all strange for a station master to get married in his Great Western Railway uniform. Not because he was slavish. But because the ideals of the transport company resonated so deeply with his own better nature. The company’s devotion to service and reliability, the grandeur of its big stations, the sense of dignity in its pension schemes – these were things someone could take to heart and feel justifiably proud to be part of.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5947" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg?resize=635%2C480" alt="PM-210214-coffinC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Corporate love: it would not have been strange for employees of the Great Western Railway to make a wedding suit of their uniform</h5>
<p>There is a great deal of large-scale ambition in the world, but all the largest corporate entities are focused on servicing basic needs: the mechanics of communication, inexpensive things to eat, energy so we can move about. While our higher needs &#8211; for love, beauty, wisdom &#8211; have no comparable provision. The drive to grandeur is missing just where we need it most.  There are times when the role of grandeur in economic life is recognisable. The employees of the Great Western Railways did not see themselves as merely having a job, required to switch the points, shovel coal or sell tickets. They understood themselves to be participants in a noble enterprise. The details of their own labour &#8211; however minor they might seem &#8211; were like the details in a great work of art, necessary contributions to a magnificent whole. It was by doing efficiently and conscientiously what they did that the great collective effects could be produced &#8211; that a fast, comfortable train could thunder through tunnels and speed across viaducts; that all the immense complexity of the machines could fire the imagination of the public. The directors of the business realised that transport could be more than just a way of getting from one place to another &#8211; one could be as a passenger strangely awestruck and moved by the beauty of the mechanisms. And they deliberately cultivated a proud sense of participation in their employees. This was not a fiction. They were not cynically pretending, so as to dupe their workers into working harder.</p>
<p>Although located in the past, this model is important for the future. It should be much more widely possible to feel proud of the enterprise one works for, to feel that the efforts one makes are in the service of something genuinely good. That is, it should be possible to sense the grandeur of the task. The experience of grandeur does not merely provide a transient feeling of elevation, it helps us internalise an outlook which we need in order to rise to some of the key individual and collective challenges of life. It counteracts our natural preference for the immediate, the piecemeal and muddling through.</p>
<p>Devotion to grandeur can be a crucial element in admirable practical achievement. Take for instance the impressive expansion of the city of Edinburgh over a period of over a hundred years &#8211; from the 1760’s to the end of the 19th century. At the start of this Edinburgh was a cramped, decaying, festering town famous for its dirty streets. By the end it was one of the most beautiful and coherent places on the planet.</p>
<p>This transformation was the led by the Town Council. They did not just think in terms of increased housing, wider, more convenient streets, the opportunities for commerce, although all of these concerns were significant. They explicitly set out to construct the finest, most beautiful, city on earth; they really believed they could do this, and such a belief was crucial at every stage. They deliberately considered the greatest achievements of the past: the public architecture Athens was self-consciously invoked as setting the standard. They wanted to be the “Athens of the North’ &#8211; that is to take their provincial capital city, with all its defects, and create something that would equal the best that the history of the world had yet shown. This could easily sound presumptuous, vain, narcissistic, impossible &#8211; but the elegance and harmony of the squares and crescents they laid out and the beauty of the public buildings they commissioned, actually live up to the high ambition they set themselves.</p>
<p>Although the council took the initiative, they could have achieved little without widespread sympathy, trust, and shared excitement. In order to turn their plans into reality there needed to be many fellow travellers, who would want to buy houses in the new streets, who would honour and admire the councillors for their ambitions and who would keep the process going in the same direction for several generations. Grandeur was a collective, social virtue, not only the special possession of a few isolated leaders.</p>
<p>Living and dying under the banner of Costa is an endearingly quirky thing to do. And yet, perhaps one day in the future, that kind of devotion could be more than quirky. We could actually be proud to do something like this.</p>
<p>What would it take for corporations to be worth a coffin or wedding suit? They’d have to engage our better selves, do proper good in the world and help us to become who we want to be. Given how much of our lives we give to our work, these sound like highly necessary and not unrealistic ambitions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the modern economy, some of the fundamental obstacles to the growth of businesses are related to the mindsets of employees. Enterprise is hampered by a number of psychological quirks that undermine efficiency, energy and harmony. The most hard-headed capitalist therefore has good incentives to address the psychological needs of those they have hired.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few of the many emotional problems that undermine the daily performance of staff:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/150782900.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5712" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/150782900.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="Shadow of a woman on a frosted glass pane, Symbolic photo to the topics: anonymity, fear, uncertainty, unsteadiness, personal secrets etc." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Denial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine a business with a complex logistics system behind it. There’s a problem developing with a supplier. However, the person dealing with this is prey to the phenomenon known as denial: that means he doesn’t pass the news up the management chain. Instead, he buries the bad news. Two weeks later, it’s become a major problem and everyone knows about it – too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The denier is in the grip of an unconscious belief that it is always too dangerous to pass on disturbing information. This habit of thinking typically has roots in early experience. Long before an unfortunate protectiveness was directed at their boss, it was a pattern required by an important early figure. For instance, as a child, they are likely to have had to step very gingerly around a fragile or explosive adult, someone who couldn’t bear to be disturbed by uncomfortable truths, giving rise to an overall terror at the consequences of imparting certain kinds of information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The denier doesn’t trust that powerful people are ever able to absorb and deal confidently with challenging things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, the burier of bad news has an excessively fragile picture of life in general and commerce and enterprise in particular: they think that if things are to work out long term, everything must be positive every step of the way. They have not internalised a vision of business in which it is normal for there to be crises pretty much all the time and for big things to be going dangerously wrong almost every day. They underestimate how much suffering and anxiety is normal in the process of doing pretty much anything impressive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems that a readiness to face bleak daily possibilities is central to the ability to avoid overall catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You try to point out that it would be great to receive a document a few days ahead of the meeting. You politely suggest that the figures don’t seem to be exactly right. You try to hint that the deadlines are in danger of being missed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the result is an immediate collision and fury. The defensive person interprets a local complaint as a global attack. Nothing about them is right any more, they are being accused not just of failing at this or that task, but of being a fundamentally worthless person. They lash out, weep or threaten to resign. The person who has tried to criticise an aspect of their work isn’t just pointing out a thing or two, in truth, they are out to question their right to exist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/72543792.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5713" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/72543792.jpg?resize=635%2C497" alt="Father discussing poor report card w/daughter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Somewhere in the past of the defensive person lies a trauma around education. They were, at an early age, unable to face their own weakness without a risk of humiliation. They rushed to lay claim to a maturity and competence that they hadn’t in fact fully earned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensive people are perfectionists in flight from the terrors of criticism, and often put in superhuman efforts to make sure they can stay ahead of any negative evaluation. But because no one can ever know everything from the start (especially if they are engaged in complex work), defensive types are guaranteed at some point to run into the feedback they so fear &#8211; despite all their hard work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tragedy is that the defensive person has stopped learning from other people. Their resistance to facing up to ignorance and incompetence is so great, it hampers their ability ever to put up their hand and simply admit they can’t cope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What the defensive person requires is enormous amounts of patience and reassurance. They need to hear they are loved and have a place in the greater scheme of things even if they forgot to send that email – but their behaviour is so proud, brittle and aggressive, they’re unlikely to secure the eulogies and good-will that they crave. Their desire always to be faultless ends up becoming their fatal liability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Social Awkwardness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An employee has the chance to step into a more senior role. It will involve a lot of travel and the need to get strangers on board fast. But they seem unable to tackle the social skills required. They blush when talking to new people, never look anyone in the eye and come across as slightly shifty, surly or even unfriendly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness is at base linked to a mistaken belief about other people: that of supposing that they are more together than in fact they are. The awkward person overrates their own distinctiveness. They don’t accept that other people are – if seen from the inside – bundles of anxieties, strange desires, off-beat thoughts and fluctuating emotions. In other words, everyone is the same. But the awkward person gives too much weight to appearances and so supposes that people who appear calm and confident have no inner turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/108963361.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5714" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/108963361.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY BEATRICE DEBUT -" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness rests on the idea of being distinctive. It is – in its way – a form of egocentricity. The solution lies in accepting that it is, in the end, entirely normal to be weird, and no reason to greet the world with crippling embarrassment or shame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Excessive Pessimism </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Businesses thrive on intelligent hope. To get anywhere requires a capacity to focus on the upside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the office pessimist sees it as a mark of intelligence to look past the superficial hopes of others. They’re not thrilled about the new American branch or the online expansion plans. They keep quiet when the new CEO arrives and don’t have much to contribute when the extraordinary opportunities for the Chinese market are outlined.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This conviction of pessimism is, ironically, often a response to excessive hope in the past. Gloominess is a defence against over-excitement – which at some point went very wrong. A way to never suffer the agonies of disappointment is to keep telling oneself – and anyone else who will listen – that failure is inevitable and that things never work out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187388841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5715" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187388841.jpg?resize=635%2C524" alt="Carlo Carvaglio, by Sironi Mario, 20th Century, 1933, oil on canvas, cm 199 x 120" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Mario Sironi,<em> Carlo Carvaglio</em>, 1933</h6>
<p class="p1">Pessimists resist a sense of grandeur. They are gripped by the idea that great things only happen to other people. There is an inner feudalism at work in their psyches that wrongly asserts that they cannot be allowed to participate in anything major.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve learned to keep their head down because they have developed a very frightening picture of ambition: it does not look like a strenuous, sane and intelligent desire to do something very difficult but worthwhile. It seems like grandiose egotistical mania – which it is (of course) usually far from being.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Excessive Optimism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They seem, at first, the most engaging people in the office. They are sure the sales targets can be met. They reassure clients that everything will work out. They have about them an air of buoyancy and bonhomie.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in the subtle internal equilibrium that separates hope from naivety, something has gone wrong. They are beset by a grievous resistance to digging into issues to discover the real troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/482267787.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5716" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/482267787.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Mauro Masi smiling" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This attitude gets entrenched when a person has too many traumatic experiences around finding things out. At some key point in their development, it was indeed very disturbing to discover what was really at play below the surface: there might have been disguised money troubles in the family, or a parent who was hiding a serious illness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such wounding experiences give rise to a general reluctance to investigate. The over-optimist isn’t just leaning on the cheerful end of uncertainty, they need everything to be absolutely OK. They worry that everyone needs to be jollied along. They fear that if anyone admits that things are less than ideal, everyone will get depressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Manic Independence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, they are a joy to be around. They just seem to get on with the task, not asking anything very much of their colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But gradually, a darker picture emerges. It isn’t that they are merely competent, they are chronically averse to inviting others to help out on tasks or to lending others a hand. When it comes to praise, they want to be the sole recipient. They know teams are meant to be a good thing. But only in theory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The manically independent person is suffering from a version of sibling rivalry. Their colleagues are viewed as competitors for the attention of a parental boss figure. There is, in their unconscious reading of the situation, not enough love to go around, and they must therefore be sure to shine independently of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/499291063.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/499291063.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="499291063" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every bit of love given to another is a little less given to them. ‘I can’t be part of the gaggle of other children,’ presumes the manically independent worker, thereby condemning themselves and their team-mates to eventual weakness and mediocrity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                        **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The obstacles to productive office life are, in various ways, all versions of emotional immaturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that knowing how to run a business at heart involves the challenge of helping employees to be more mature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds like an odd idea, given that we expect businesses to be engaged merely in practical tasks. But at this point in the evolution of capitalism, the challenges most workers face are, to a large extent, psychological in nature, which means that emotional well-being can’t any longer be seen as merely a luxury or an after-thought. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough how important emotional maturity is in relationships and family life. It turns out that it is no less important at the office. Optimistically, given how long we spend at our desks, it might be that the office won’t just be a place to work, it could – if we use it properly – also be a training ground for a maturity that we can take back out into the world, and put to use in the kitchen as much as in the weekly management meeting.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For most of human history and in almost all places it would have seemed absurd for employers to give their employees personal feedback. It was out of the question that the boss could get together with a member of staff and appraise their work, ask about their feelings, attitudes, hopes and ambitions. The basic relationship was of command on one side and obedience on the other. In teaching, there was a strict separation of master and pupil; there were those who gave the orders and those who did what they were told. And if they were slow to do so, there were plenty of punishments on hand. The most widespread management tool was the whip.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things have changed today for one central reason. Not because bosses are nicer, but because the tasks of business are more psychologically complex than in the past. There’s been an entirely practical and hard-nosed realisation that to get the best performance, people need to be psychologically in a good place: which means well-motivated, in good spirits, even enthusiastic and eager around the tasks they are doing. This is the only way not to waste a lot of money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/561977001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5701" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/561977001.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Businessmen At Conference Table" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, when much work was purely routine, and dependent primarily on flexing the body, management didn’t care so much about what was happening inside the head of the workforce. An unhappy person can type, or hack coal, as fast as a jolly one; a broken-hearted individual can add figures or stick labels as quickly as one who has a spring in their step. The psychology of the worker or employee didn’t seem like a significant factor in the success of an enterprise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, however, command is no longer enough. Shouting is ineffective as a way of getting people to perform particular tasks well. The whip has ceased to be useful. Work has changed from being physical or mechanical in character to becoming much more psychological. The task might be to come up with a more intriguing kind of packaging; to get the front of house staff to listen more empathetically to the demands of difficult customers; to get a sales force to believe in the merits of a new product, so they can sell it wholeheartedly; to get an IT manager to be more creative in the way they interact with other sectors of the business. For all these kinds of tasks it becomes crucial to get the employee into the right frame of mind. Their sheer technical skill isn’t enough. Their motives, attitudes, outlook – their character – become important factors in how the business goes. So, even if they don’t especially relish the task, the senior management need to take the mental well-being of the employee very seriously. We have moved from the era of <em>physical management</em> to that of <em>psychological management</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187560281.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5696" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187560281.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="Barclays ATP World Tour Finals - Day Seven" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is also a more inspiring idea that can be taken from elite sports. The very best tennis players don’t only spend a lot of time working to perfect their service or backhand crosscourt return. They have long ago realised that the top tournaments are won, in significant measure, in their heads. Their ability to master a range of psychological skills are at the heart of their success. They need to know how to be unruffled by huge pressure; how to handle self-doubt; how to have the confidence to come back after a string of errors&#8230; The great player has a life full of psychological feedback &#8211; and is good around it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office feedback session is currently our society’s main way of addressing what we can call the <em><strong>Psychological Obstacles</strong></em> to the success of a business. Companies recognise that they need to give feedback on various habits of mind – on the distortions or neuroses of character – that get in the way of good performance and hence of profitability.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In any office, the <strong><em>Psychological Obstacles</em> </strong>of staff will – for certain – include some of the following: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Denial: the manic burying of bad news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dangerous Independence: the loner who doesn’t share information or who is averse to drawing on the skills and insights of other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Disguised Ignorance: the person who tends to hide whatever they don’t know. They give the impression of being entirely on top of an issue, only for it to emerge later that they were very unsure of what they were doing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poor teaching skills: someone who can’t transmit, effectively, what they know to those who need to share it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poor learning skills: the individual who doesn’t listen properly when something is being explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despair and pessimism: the trait of always anticipating disaster and spreading gloom around the office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over-optimism and naivety: the resistance to digging into issues to discover the real troubles. Breeziness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reluctance to accept guidance, because guidance is experienced as humiliating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tendency to under-confidence and lack of ambition; the person who doesn’t like to acknowledge the scale of the opportunity: a lack of grandeur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impatience: primarily interested in ticking the boxes fast; they don’t enter into the spirit of the tasks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cynicism: the person who doesn’t believe the company is honourable; they feel the employers don’t care about them: they’re disengaged, resentful and a bit sullen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness: a lack of confidence and shame makes people unable to present themselves confidently and with a measure of charm to others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each of these habits of mind is connected to how a project could fail. They are psychological obstacles to prosperity. To be more profitable, you need to crack these. Their collective costs to the economy is quite simply immense. Businesses currently recognises these symptoms, but are generally not at all able to cure them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Feedback was invented to get more out of employees and thereby to lift the productivity and the profitability of the company. But it’s difficult for a number of reasons. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fear of the Employer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As an employee, it’s easy to feel that employers are being mean or cruel if they point to a problem. The employee typically is not privy to the range of anxieties and pressures that are going on off-stage. The employer is frantic because the business is facing a very tough year and the employees are making a hash of some major projects. So the person giving the feedback is themselves under pressure. They can’t necessarily be the ideal parent and be endlessly forgiving, generous and patient. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/171163368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5698" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/171163368.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2013 NHL Stanley Cup Final - Game Four" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s often extremely hard for us to accept negative information about ourselves; to hear that we haven’t met expectations, that there’s a problem with what we’re doing or that we need to change in some way. We easily slip between hearing a local point (about the delivery of a report, the handling of a negotiation) and a global point (about one’s whole life and character). So we readily feel persecuted, upset and deeply hurt by what should really be understood as specific details. Our sensitivity and touchiness is not something that can be overcome by abrasive assertion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It still isn’t normal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ritual and what is taken for granted helps us cope with tricky things. If it is entirely expected – and a time honoured tradition – that at a certain point people say what they think is wrong with one another, the personal sting of feedback is lessened. It doesn’t feel weird or indecently hostile and frankly scary if someone (at the sanctioned time) says: OK, so there are five things wrong with you… And you know that this happens to everyone: it’s going on in the boardroom as well. But, at present, feedback still has the power to feel persecutory and arbitrary.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">There isn’t enough training</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The human brain is such a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>complicated, strange entity. Trying to adjust a person’s outlook or habits is a little like attempting to perform surgery. Except around surgery the difficulties have long been acknowledged. Removing a cataract, say, is reserved for highly trained experts, working in very carefully designed environments. However, the average company assigns feedback, which is a no less delicate and important task – the task of attempting to sort out someone’s thoughts in their head and reform their character – to an executive who has read a couple of journal articles and, at best, attended a one day seminar in a hotel outside the city. There’s, astonishingly, still not much training. The company doesn’t really take the task of overcoming psychological obstacles seriously – the senior people don’t spend a lot of time talking to each other about how to improve feedback and how highly they regard anyone who is good at it. We’ve broadly accepted the idea that work is a place where you acquire skills. But we’re still only just getting round to the notion that one of the skills – and maybe the most important – is that work is, and has to be, an agent of emotional education, a creator of maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Work tests all of us hard: not simply in our technical capacity, but in our ability to face psychological difficulties with some degree of confidence, to accept failure, to be generous to the needs of others, to know our limits and be canny about our strengths. These are not simply assets in the work place. These are the psychological building blocks of good partners in a relationship, of good parents and of mature citizens. Work reveals our psychological flaws and – ideally – educates us to overcome them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Scepticism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Businesses will always contain a lot of people who are very sceptical of anything that isn’t immediately about selling more of the products or cutting costs. There’s an idea of what it is to be serious about business which militates against a psychological approach and that, in the name of rigour and financial maturity, refuses to recognise psychological training as legitimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dealing well with the psychological obstacles requires a move beyond recognising their symptoms. It requires a map of the real nature of the problems and of their causes. The solution isn’t going to be about presenting a true large insight on one grand occasion (the yearly review), and expecting transformation. That’s because the problems have the character of habits, and changing habits is a different kind of undertaking. The corporate atmosphere will need to be calm, unafraid and very patient.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166796508.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5699" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166796508.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Puppy Mills, 10 Million Caged Hens Fuel Humane Society?s CEO" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The psychological dividend </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every business is less successful than it could and should be because of the very much less than ideal states of mind of its employees and leaders. Successfully addressing the<em><strong> psychological obstacles</strong></em> releases a <em><strong>psychological dividend</strong></em>. Depending upon the field of business the psychological dividend, in purely financial terms, is an increased profitability of between 25 and 30 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Feedback may seem at first like a small issue of office routine. But it is a place where we can see the economy of the future starting to emerge. It begins to address the question of the kind of education we need, collectively, in order to get a great economy. We are still at the very early stages of psychological training in the workplace. Businesses have long accepted the need for special education – and know they can’t do it all themselves alongside their normal activities (it wouldn’t occur to businesses to train people to write; they accept there needs to be schools for this sort of thing). In the utopia, all Business Schools would be providing a very thorough and astute emotional education. At the moment, maths and the sciences tend to be most highly valued. This fashion derives from an analysis of what was most missing from business in the past. Today, we can get machines to do the maths. What we are short of is psychological sophistication and health. </span></p>

<p>The idea that work might be fulfilling rather than just painfully necessary is a strikingly recent invention. Nowadays, in the prosperous world, we don&#8217;t only expect to obtain money through labour, we also, to a greater or lesser extent, expect to find meaning and satisfaction. It&#8217;s a big ask and explains why so many of us have career crises.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting people to work hard and do their best – to be highly motivated – is a central problem not only of individual businesses but of the economy as a whole. Everyone can recognise in themselves what a huge difference being fired-up makes: you confront challenges with energy, you sail through routine tasks, you stay calm under pressure, you come up with solutions to problems. If only we could unlock this kind of attitude in ourselves, we would, more widely, produce a much higher productivity and a flourishing economy.</p>
<p>There are lots of ideas in circulation about how to enhance motivation: it might help if an office or workplace is light, airy and pleasant; has a pizza day once a month; makes space for a table-tennis table. But such suggestions only hover around the edges. The overwhelmingly dominant current belief is that the best way to get people motivated is by giving them financial threats and inducements. Higher financial rewards are taken to be the essential way by which you attract and keep talent.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456486250.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5397" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456486250.jpg?resize=635%2C387" alt="Volkswagen : Press Preview Prior The 'Mondial De L'Automobile' - Paris Motorshow 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This theory was applied on a massive scale, in the later part of the twentieth century. A great many state-owned enterprises – railways, car manufacturing companies, power-stations &#8211; were seen to be failing. They were not efficient or profitable. Privatisation was conceived as a way of using a financial carrot and stick mechanism to reform them. If successful, the management could now expect very much higher salaries. And – on the other side – competitive failure would be punished by the market. The company could go bust, and everyone would lose their jobs – rather than being eternally supported by a forgiving and generous government.</p>
<p>Fear and reward around money, administered by the free market, were seen as the crucial factors that would transform motivation and turn lacklustre companies into commercial dynamos. This approach has worked its way deep into our vision of motivation. If a company wants to hire the most impressive graduates, it must offer the highest entry salaries. It’s summed up in the supposed common sense truth that if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.</p>
<p>Still, companies continually struggle with motivation. Their employees don’t seem to care about the work itself: they gossip and chatter; they feel bored; they get tired easily; their minds are mostly half on something else; they don’t come in each day eager to overcome problems; they do the minimum they can get away with; they are always dreaming of days off and holidays; they live for the weekend. They seem to get sick a lot – and leave regularly. They want promotion, not because they really would be good at shouldering extra responsibility, but because it’s the way to get more money. Organisations are constantly playing around with the levers of financial motivation; offering or withholding money as an inducement or a threat. They use individual and team bonuses, cash rewards, profit sharing and company stock as ways of using economic factors to enhance motivation.</p>
<p>But there are some very striking examples of motivation outside this system. The military is a central case. In the armed forces – often for very modest pay – people will do extraordinary things. Even die. It’s an astonishing contrast. You can pay someone £18,000 a year to die for you. But you struggle to pay someone £22,000 a year to sit in a room and fill in forms.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459937168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5405" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459937168.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="NETHERLANDS-ROYAL-MILITARY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This tells us that motivation simply cannot be primarily financial. People can be moved by money. But they can be moved and motivated much more by other things. The armed forces also tell us something about where the strongest kinds of motivation come from.</p>
<p>In the army, the soldier doesn’t just think they are serving their own interests; they see themselves as serving the best interests of their nation. They believe that what they are doing is right and deeply important. The intensity of their motivation is tied to their conviction of the great value of what they are involved in. It isn’t for money that they are ready to suffer hardship and expose themselves to grave danger; it’s for their country’s honour or to protect the people they love. Here, motivation is the result of the individual operating with a visceral sense of furthering a part of what one might call ‘the Good’, through their work. The soldier needs to get paid (how else can they live?) but it’s not the money that’s got the emotional pulling power.</p>
<p>‘The Good’ isn’t a phrase we tend to use everyday; and it’s entirely understandable that we’ve become a bit nervous around it. But ‘the Good’ makes perfect intuitive sense: it’s the satisfaction of the highest needs of mankind. It’s all the things that are felt to be in accordance with an ideal of human flourishing and the better self – what the Greek Philosophers called <em>eudaimonia</em>. It includes, though isn’t limited to, nursing, protecting, delighting, sheltering, teaching and enabling others. Though capitalism tends to describe humans as primarily financially-driven, self-maximising creatures, there is an important extent to which we are in fact driven to serve other people – and gain our greatest thrills from doing so.</p>
<p>Obviously people disagree about what exactly constitutes the best way to serve others. But the search isn’t for a single thing that could motivate everyone in the world. What companies need to find is an account of authentic serving that they can believe in and which they want to get employees to share.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461446556.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5401" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461446556.jpg?resize=635%2C447" alt="President Obama Welcomes NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs To White House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The more the worker feels they are contributing to the Good, the less there is a problem of motivation. They see their work as being something important; they want to do it right. They believe deeply that it needs to be done and they feel proud of their role (however modest) in making it happen. Money is a vital active ingredient here. But it’s the worth of the undertaking that moves people. And if an organisation can convincingly present itself as serving the Good, there’s less need to use the instrument of money as the primary source of motivation (either through punishment or reward).</p>
<p>So, for organisations, there’s a central challenge around articulating their mission so as to tap into the deeper roots of human motivation. Can they lay claim to our stronger motives – by orienting themselves towards serving an aspect of the Good and explaining this internally and to the world?</p>
<p>For some organisations, this is going to be a very testing exercise: because it will show up just how far they currently are from having any purpose that could truly motivate people: how far they are from doing something properly worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are plenty of organisations that serve the Good directly – even if they don’t entirely live up to this task – like schools and hospitals. But what about a company that manufactures and supplies paper clips? Are they connected to the Good? The explicit service they provide is very modest: preventing sheaves of loose paper getting muddled. But the human territory in which it operates is large: the longing to bring and maintain purposeful order. It is the same end that is served, with greater public recognition, by libraries, museums, maps, statistics and logic. The makers of paperclips make a small but significant contribution to the noble cause of Order in human life.</p>
<p>Society is often rather snobbish in this regard. It will bestow glamour on brain surgeons, but neglect the humbler work of the nurse. It will be impressed by fighter pilots, but not so much by traffic wardens. And yet the so-called ‘lesser’ activities are always connected up with the higher ones. It merely takes a more generous, imaginative, even artistic eye to spot the link.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5400" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg?resize=635%2C781" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Vermeer’s <em>Little Street</em>, shows people involved in activities which then, as now, were generally regarded as pretty humble. Sweeping the yard, darning a sock, scrubbing the tiles. And we can imagine people often not being terribly motivated. Vermeer must have overheard all the familiar complaints: ‘What’s the point. I’m only going to have to do it all again tomorrow. No one notices much. It’s so tedious.’ But his aim, remarkable and very necessary in all eras, is to return true glamour to these little tasks: in themselves they may be minor. But they enact something major. They are the details out of which a deeply impressive and attractive civic life is created.</p>
<p>Vermeer is showing how you reconnect members of the workforce with the higher Good that they are in fact serving. He shows them (and us) the beauty of what they are doing in keeping a house tidy. He reminds them of the wonderful whole of which they are parts. The picture is an ideal motivator, because it makes the worker see the dignity and value of what they do. It’s reminding them why they want to be part of this. And so the role of money in motivation takes a slightly back seat.</p>
<p>The artist Vermeer is defining a central task of management, which is to ensure that the part of the Good in which the company is operating becomes as visible as possible. In the army and other top performing organisations, the Good is visible without too much work needing to be done. One can just tell that brain surgery and civil defence are important. Also, in many, daily ways the ultimate point of the organisation is restated and reaffirmed. So in the army there are, unabashedly, songs and flags, rituals, medals and ceremonies which are designed to keep at the front of every individual’s mind just exactly what this organisation is for. The relevance (and therefore the worth) of every task can be explained. If someone asks why they have to polish their shoes so much there’s an answer: it’s an exercise in discipline. Or if they ask why do they have to go for long runs on hot days: so as to prepare for conditions in conflict zones. The point of using the Army as a model here isn’t particularly to single them out for praise in terms of what they are for. It’s to point up the organisational advantages of an institution seeing itself as having a clear and important relationship to the Good.</p>

<p>Let’s move into the civilian sector. The Swiss Federal Railways has framed their relatively unexciting task of moving people in rectangular boxes from one place to another in the Helvetic Republic via another, more abstract, ideal: that of integration. At a purely practical level they are devoted to ensuring that the train service is aligned with bus and boat services. But, above that, is a political ambition: a country should see itself as a collective entity, our lives are connected and a civilised, universal and egalitarian transport system gives physical expression to that idea of the Good. The company is a kind of secular religion that worships timetables and connections. By investing in especially beautiful clocks (that are all synchronised), elegant stations, and dignified uniforms and by developing a cult of being on time, the railway corporation tells itself and the wider world about its ideals: that is about how it serves the Good. An employee might be undertaking a comparatively narrow task: monitoring freight movements or checking passenger tickets. But they are rightly proud of being part of this mighty system; which is another way of saying, they can see how what they do actually does serve the nation. We should take in two other aspects: firstly, the Swiss Federal Railways manages to be both highly efficient and in government hands (no need for privatisation when the Good is visible). And salaries do not need to be particularly elevated: because people know what they are serving and are proud to do so.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/106342374.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5402" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/106342374.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Gotthard Tunnel Feature" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>In the ideal economy, all firms would be focused on addressing our true needs. So, they would all have a very good case to make: they would all in fact be serving the Good in some more or less direct fashion. And therefore, every job would be worth doing, and the person doing it would enjoy a full measure of public and self-respect. And the owners of the firms would equally be entitled to such regard.</p>
<p>We aren’t there yet. Many firms (the sellers of trash TV shows; the builders of substandard houses etc.) sell us below average goods and do not advance human welfare in any distinct way. These are the firms where money is everything and where we feel in our bones that working there will only be a means to survive rather than to flourish.</p>
<p>But already we can see the shape of the future of capitalism: a world where we get better at learning to make money from the Good – and where we learn how to make the Good more visible to employees and the world; so that one is working for money, but, as importantly, one can see that one is working to make a slightly better world, one elegant paper clip at a time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is six o’clock on a late-February morning, in a village fifty kilometres from London, in the Berkshire countryside. To define what is painfully coming to an end, thanks to the pitiless insistence of an electronic beep, as ‘being asleep’ doesn’t scratch the surface of what has really been going on for the last seven or eight hours in thousands of different dreams, animated by unexpected faces and emotions.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1863" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteA1.jpg" alt="London, England, Britain - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How quiet the nation was only forty-five minutes ago, and yet how much hair-rinsing, necktie-tying, key-searching, stain-removing, child-goading and spouse-shouting will occur over the next thirty, in homes within a gigantic circle drawn around the English capital, from Folkestone to Aylesbury, from Haslemere to Chelmsford.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually, there comes the scramble for bags and coats and the walk in the chill air to the train station. Once outside, it seems extraordinary that the natural world should still exist and be so apparently undisturbed and serene, so indifferent to human concerns, with a new sky which has wiped away yesterday’s squalls and holds no grudges, a scene of innocent beauty that bolsters any attempt to search within oneself for reserves of resilience and good humour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1864" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteB.jpg" alt="UK Train Travel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2">The train will be on time, say the screens at the station. On the platform, under Victorian arches almost spongy with the paint of decades, there are advertisements for West End plays and day excursions to historic castles. A plane crosses high overhead, a veteran of a still earlier departure, perhaps with a child on board at this very moment gazing down and seeing, within the circumference of a window, the full extent of the railway line threading its way from the coast to the city. Back on the ground, from a distance, swaying slightly from side to side, its headlamps on and sparks flashing around its wheels, a green-liveried train comes into view, sounding its toy-like horn against a wide horizon.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Entering the carriage feels like interrupting a congregation. The cold air cuts into daydreams which must have begun far up the line. The settled passengers neither look up nor give any other overt sign of taking notice, but they betray their awareness of any new arrival by dextrously readjusting their limbs to allow them to struggle past them to one of the remaining unoccupied seats. The train moves off, resuming its rhythmical clicking along tracks laid down a century and a half ago, when the capital first began plucking workers from their beds in faraway villages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1865" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteC.jpg" alt="London, England, Britain - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© REX/Mode</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is something improbable about the silence in the carriage, considering how naturally gregarious we are as a species. Still, how much kinder it is for the commuters to pretend to be absorbed in other things, rather than revealing the extent to which they are covertly evaluating, judging, condemning and desiring each other. A few venture a glance here and there, as furtively as birds pecking grain. But only if the train crashed would anyone know for sure who else had been in the carriage, what small parts of the nation’s economy had been innocuously seated across the aisle just before the impact: employees of hotels, government ministries, plastic-surgery clinics, fruit nurseries and greetings-card companies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Newspapers are being read all around. The point is not, of course, to glean new information, but rather to coax the mind out of its sleep-induced introspective temper. To look at the paper is to raise a seashell to one’s ear and to be overwhelmed by the roar of humanity. Today there is a story about a man who fell asleep at the wheel of his car after staying up late into the night committing adultery on the internet – and drove off an overpass, killing a family of five in a caravan below. Another item speaks of a university student, beautiful and promising, who went missing after a party and was found in pieces in the back of a minicab five days later. A third rehearses the particulars of an affair between a tennis coach and her thirteen-year-old pupil. These accounts, so obviously demented and catastrophic, are paradoxically consoling, for they help us to feel sane and blessed by comparison. We can turn away from them and experience a new sense of relief at our predictable routines; we can be grateful for how tightly bound we have kept our desires, and proud of the restraint we have shown in not poisoning our colleagues or entombing our relations under the patio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Familiar vignettes stream by outside: a power station, a patch of waste ground, a postal depot, a copse of ancient trees, a group of schoolgirls in grey-and-blue uniforms, a band of cumulus clouds spreading from the west, a shopping mall across a motorway, some underwear swaying on a line, and then gradually, the backs of suburban villas, heralding the train’s arrival into central London itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1867" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteD1.jpg" alt="Commuters Head To Work As The U.K. Economy Continues To Recover" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Employees are already beginning to course through the plate-glass doors of countless offices. They have stepped off railway carriages at Victoria and Farringdon, London Bridge and Waterloo, driven through tunnels, been rattled by diesel buses, run down airport concourses, jogged across parks and cycled over hills and high streets. What varied breakfasts they have eaten, too. Danish pastries, the remains of last night’s curry, sausages, scotch eggs and bowls of Cheerios and Coco Pops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To feel at home in an office is not to notice the strange silver sculpture in the lobby and to forget how alien the place felt on the first day. The start of work means the end to freedom, but also to doubt, intensity and wayward desires. Our ten thousand possibilities are reduced to an agreeable handful. We have a business card which we hand over in meetings and which tells other people – and, more meaningfully perhaps, reminds us – that we have a place in this world and are not just a vaporous transient consciousness in an incidental universe. How satisfying it is to be held in check by the assumptions of colleagues, instead of being forced to contemplate, in the loneliness of the early hours, all that one might have been and perhaps never will be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There might be a meeting scheduled for nine-thirty, leaving time for a muffin and coffee. The start of the day in the office has burnt off nostalgia as the sun evaporates a coat of dew. Life is no longer mysterious, sad, haunting, confusing or melancholy; it is a practical stage for clear-eyed action.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the big causes of stress is that we often face problems that can’t be solved in any reasonable period of time or indeed solved at all. It’s going to take five more years until we’re ready to start the job we really want. That big project at work will taken another 24 months before it shows any signs of real progress. The annoying colleague is a daily challenge, with no end in sight. Even now, deep in adulthood, your sibling or parent remains an ongoing source of frustration. You’ve just had the same argument for the twentieth time with your partner; it always ends in apologies, but a real advance is elusive. Your child has again damaged the sofa. In other words, our longing for control and completion is constantly being frustrated – and, as a result, calm can be very elusive.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/73184398.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5318" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/73184398.jpg?resize=635%2C210" alt="In a Japanese garden designed by landscape archite" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we should seek out and give prestige to tasks that – however small – can be done perfectly.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Zen Buddhist monks understood this perfectly. In the 15th century, they developed into an art form the task of raking gravel into perfect shapes. In the Zen gardens of Kyoto, gravel is carefully raked into beautifully neat little rows. Perhaps just in straight lines, or with more ambitious patterns of swirls and circles. The lines are often on a very small scale. It’s a fiddly task. You might inadvertently tread on a bit you’ve done. You might struggle to keep the rake going at just the right angle. It could be maddening. But it can all be put right. With a bit more time, a bit of careful correction, you can get it just how it should be. The problems of raking gravel are real. But they can be solved. It’s a bit like doing a jigsaw. At a certain stage you feel that you have no idea where lots of pieces could possibly go. They are spread in little confused heaps on the carpet. Yet, deep down, you know that all it takes is time and patience. Every piece will eventually find its home. It’s tricky, but reassuringly doable – unlike so many other things with which we have to engage.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2440" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-gardenB.jpg" alt="Japan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are not wrong to love perfection. It’s a very good longing. But it needs to be given manageable outlets. That’s why spending half an hour gouging straight lines in a small patch of gravel is therapeutic. It takes the edge off our frustration. It allows for the creation of something ordered, beautiful and harmonious – even if it is only a couple of yards squared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Merely looking at a picture of carefully tended gravel offers respite and restoration. It reminds us that in all the insoluble chaos of daily life, some things can indeed be made exactly and entirely right.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Almost certainly, you’ve been having a bad time at work. In a perfect world, work should do so much for us: lend us purpose and a sense of achievement, offer us meaning and comradeship. But invariably, something goes wrong: our talents feel like they’re not being recognised, the company seems unfit to sacrifice a life for, the day-to-day tasks are mundane and stressful and many in management are like grown-up versions of playground bullies.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2531" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/33501571.jpg" alt="Office Reprimand" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are readily drawn to blaming ourselves for the mess: we were impulsive in our career choices, we were vain and lazy; we haven’t got the drive of a classmate from university (she now runs an empire). Yet for all the truths that self-condemnation might contain, many of the factors that cause our dreams to run into the sand in fact lie outside of our direct control, in the very structure of employment within the capitalist system. To blame ourselves is to misunderstand the nature of reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What follows is a run-through of some of the factors that might explain our unhappiness at work outside of individual failings:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. I’m in the wrong job</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You feel – often on Sunday evenings – that at some point you took a wrong turn. Becoming an architect was, in retrospect, an insane focus for your talents. It was a piece of babyish absurdity to confuse the pleasure of reading magazines with the hell of working on them. At the outset, commercial litigation seemed glamorous; now you know it is an excuse to turn your clients’ entanglements into obscene sums for the partners on the 46th floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you wonder why you made such momentous errors, the reason is painfully simple: you simply had no idea what was at stake. Long ago, you were left alone with a decision that you had no capacities to address sensibly. And now you are trapped in a cage built for you by a blind 20-year-old version of yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our culture is mesmerised by the experiences of a small number of exceptional people who know from a young age what their talents and inclinations are and how best to direct them in the adult world. These people – the writer, the orchestra conductor, the priest, the scientist – are propelled by a calling and apparently guided by the hand of destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impressed by these characters, our societies have fallen prey to the charming but reckless democratic idea that everyone has a professional destiny – and should be left alone to discover it. But, in truth, almost no one does have such a thing. Most of us hover weakly between multiple possibilities; we have no sense of what we would deeply enjoy, what is available and what we would be best suited to. Panicked, we therefore choose blindly, in a hurry, under pressure – and, inevitably, erroneously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before choosing, we are often sent to a career counsellor for a session or two – in order to decide the nature of our work on this earth for the next 40 years. We spend more time choosing a car or a holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Career counselling should have become one of the major growth-areas of our times. Scientists should be competing to develop ever more accurate technology in the field. The stars of the profession should be on television. Yet currently, the job feels on a par with being a brain surgeon in medieval times, a mixture of quackery and guess work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2532" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1982315a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© REX</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, we stumble and drift – or rush headlong into a career on the basis of uncertain insights. What happens as a result is not principally our fault. We are just very poorly advised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. This is just meaningless</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every day, in large corporations, people daydream about leaving to run a little B&amp;B somewhere in the countryside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It mostly remains a fantasy (fortunately), but it’s one that all the same tells us something very important about what we want from work. We long to find it meaningful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work becomes meaningful whenever we feel in some way able to help another human being to be happier through our labour, either by reducing their suffering or by increasing their pleasure. It may be a major intervention, like repairing a heart valve. Or it could be a minor one, like bringing them a cup of tea, showing them a sunny spot in the garden or suggesting a great place for dinner nearby.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2533" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/148850890.jpg" alt="Quaint Cottage in The Cotswolds, UK" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2">Almost all corporations make promises about happiness to their customers. But the demands of Profit have a grievous tendency to conflict with the Promises of Happiness. From a corporate point of view, it makes perfect sense, for instance, for a computer company to design obsolescent software or for a biscuit company to soak their products in glucose. It’s the logic of the market. But from the point of view of employees, it is disastrous at the level of meaning.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A business can only feel meaningful when its employees are able to take a degree of pride in what the entity is setting out to do. The tragedy of most businesses is that their true objective – their deepest aim – is not to help or be genuinely useful, but first and foremost, it is to reward their shareholders, a goal which employees must always rightly resent sacrificing their lives for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. What have I achieved today?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We reach the end of the working day and wonder what we have really done. We are one of 15,000 people in an organisation on three continents working on projects that will come to fruition in five years time. The vast time horizons and huge corporations of modernity contribute to destroy any tangible impression of being able to make a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the olden times, it was easier on this score. In a matter of hours, the cobbler could produce the shoes that he would see other people walking about in with satisfaction for months afterwards. The baker produced the rolls in the middle of the night that were sold at breakfast time, lending him a direct feeling of the way his work impacted positively on the lives of his neighbours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2535" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/464493323-1.jpg" alt="Making wooden clogs, Sweden." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, for reasons first explained by Adam Smith in the latter part of the 18th century, that way of experiencing work has disappeared from modern economies. Capitalists recognised that it would be a great deal more profitable for them to split the tasks formerly done by one person in a single day into hundreds of tasks carried out by thousands of people over whole careers. The age of specialisation had begun and with it, gradually, the mania for incomprehensible job titles: Logistics supply manager, Packaging coordinator, Communications and learning officer…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certainly things have grown more efficient. Customers get things more cheaply. Profits have risen. But for most of those working in the businesses themselves, it has become ever harder to feel what the point of work might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The regional deputy packaging manager of a gargantuan biscuit manufacturer is in truth connected by precise steps to the moment when a customer consumes a chocolate biscuit with her morning tea. But the extreme specialisation of work means that neither the employee, nor anyone else in the firm, ever really feels that they have made the decisive difference to the tea-break of a customer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Why are my salary and benefits so low?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial promise of Capitalism is that things will be cheap. Competition looks great when we want to pay less for an air ticket to Toronto or for a ready-made penne chicken alfredo. But if you are the cabin crew or a chicken farmer, competition is misery. Bargain prices mean less security, fewer benefits and lower pay scales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There might be other ways. Governments could insist on minimum prices, determining a level that ensured decent employment and products. A single egg, for instance, might have to cost 35p if a chicken were to be properly fed, and live in an adequate environment and if the farmer and his team were to make a proper living. At present eggs sell at 16.3p. We call it a ‘bargain’: a euphemism for someone else taking on an unfair burden of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3989892074_3e3e48b1a3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6994" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3989892074_3e3e48b1a3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="3989892074_3e3e48b1a3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Tobias Mandt</h6>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other solution would be public education. The economy is ultimately driven not by businesses but by consumers. Corporations just supply whatever customers are willing to pay for. There’s a mass market in cheap eggs because so many people don’t much care about the suffering of chickens and farmers. But what people care about is not a dictate of nature. It can change. We can be led to weep over the fates of strangers and feel sympathy for subjects we might previously have never known existed. Our behaviour is a cultural creation, open to education – and through education, someone might come to the conclusion that they fervently wouldn’t want to breakfast on an egg from a bird that had been manhandled by a degraded workforce.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. There’s too much to do</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so busy. If we stop for a moment, we feel guilty. We can’t relax in the evening – except with too much alcohol. We are constantly emailing and checking websites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2537" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481206595.jpg" alt="Social Media Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to blame the technology which keeps us on call all the time. But there’s something beneath our addiction to technology: fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are busy because we are afraid and we are afraid for good reasons. We stick to our desks because it appears, and may even be, excessively dangerous to leave them. We experience life as something akin to a battle. The suggestion that we relax and take more holidays can sound as though a medieval knight were being advised to take his helmet off during combat and enjoy a picnic comfortably within range of the enemy archers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world is so deeply competitive, the penalties of underperforming are so harsh, an addiction to work is not an unreasonable response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The workaholic doesn’t need to be upbraided for their compulsive behaviour, as they often are (particularly by spouses). They require sympathy; they need the rational basis of their anxieties to be respected. Though people’s excessive commitment to work may place an intolerable burden on their health and their relationships, it sadly isn’t unreasonable. The constant commitment is the logical consequence of a murderously competitive commercial environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. I can’t bear my colleagues</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every job requires interactions with people who, given a free choice, we would carefully avoid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are all easily hurt. We might not be keen to admit it, but a single cruel word or snide remark can throw us off balance for the day. In private life, we can show our wounds. We can complain, we sulk, we argue. But at work, we can do nothing. We are at the mercy of others, with very little protection against low level infringements of our dignity, peace of mind and self-esteem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2538" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rbcm_84.jpg" alt="rbcm_84" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work makes us submit to power. The person in charge doesn’t have to care about our feelings. We have exchanged our right to communicate our pain for a monthly paycheck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Why have I been passed over?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are more fantasies of great destinies than there are great destinies themselves. Almost all businesses are structured like pyramids, and every passing year, brings us closer to the summit – or not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2539" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/105698844.jpg" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The structure of corporations writes disappointment into the contract for almost everyone. There can only be one winner in every cohort filled with potential leaders. Who will get the job won’t even hinge on pure talent, there will be no race we can enter and be judged fairly in. It will be shockingly haphazard: who happens to click with a particular board member; who recently had a nice lunch with whom… These are not scurrilous factors; but they are arbitrary enough to be responsible for decades of extraordinary resentment and injury in the hearts of all those who won’t succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">**                                  **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of these problems can be easily removed. But once we understand their structural nature, we should be allowed to feel communally distraught over, rather than individually persecuted by them – and by all the agonies and stresses that work inevitably directs our way, on this long, wearying day as on so many others.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You might think this bit would be easy, but one of the hardest things about our working lives is knowing what we ideally want to do with them. It’s simple enough to sense what is boring and soul-destroying, but identifying what would satisfy us is a greater challenge. It’s a good deal less straightforward than asking oneself what one wants to eat or drink, sadly because finding one’s way to good work relies (along with many other things) on having a firm grasp of our eventual preferred destination.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Indications of what jobs might appeal to us tend to come in garbled and indirect forms, for example, in those moments of curiosity and envy we sometimes feel when we hear what someone is up to; for example, when we learn that a friend of a friend has started up a project to take Australian high school students to climb Mount Kilimanjaro; or that someone you were at university with has become a chair designer; or when at a party someone tells you about how neuroscience is changing advertising; or there’s a magazine feature on a guy who bought a chain of budget hotels, repackaged them and sold them on, pocketing a fortune in the process…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2544" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/105699467.jpg" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At these sort of moments, from deep within us, we may occasionally register confused signals of interest, akin to the beep a metal detector might let off while passing over an area of waste ground. There is something here, but it can be devilishly tricky to unearth what precisely it might be. We’re given little encouragement to stop and properly interpret our feelings. The urgent task should be to disentangle the underlying identity of a job from the example of the specific person who first aroused our interest in it. If we can see its nature clearly we are then able to look more actively for something else a bit like it in the world around us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might sound self-indulgent to talk of enjoying work when work of any kind is so hard to find, but fantasising about what we ideally want does not have to mean expecting it will be easy to secure it. Ideals are destinations. However, if we get to know an ideal, we can start to figure out more carefully what it might take to head in that direction or what a decent enough alternative might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A priority is therefore to get a better sense of what pleasures are theoretically available among a range of occupations – and to build up a skill at listening closely to what jobs set off those small beeps of interest that hint at a connection with our deepest selves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The pleasures of work</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Ordering</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world is a chaotic place: fractured, incoherent, noisy, random. A central pleasure in a number of jobs is therefore that of being able to bring order to some aspect of life: of creating – in a demarcated space – a realm of superior logic, coherence or meaning. It is the pleasure, in the grandest and simplest of ways, of tidying things up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great many jobs, and not necessarily the obvious ones, are united by this search for order: doing the laundry, drawing up spreadsheets, arranging a buffet, completing a planning schedule for a logistics company…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the work of a car designer, who finds pleasure in setting every dial in harmony with every other, of creating a fit between the fuel gauge and the rev counter, the air conditioning and the heater buttons, of arranging brushed steel control knobs that press with satisfying clicks and indicator sticks that swipe up and down with unusual assurance – a cabin environment that in its studied solidity is palpably different from the way life usually is.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2545" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156729725.jpg" alt="Philadelphia Style Magazine Cover Event Hosted By Chris Matthews" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their outputs might be different, but at the level of the pleasure involved, it is perhaps only a small step between what the engineers at Audi are doing and what would have been Andrea Palladio’s satisfactions when designing the Villa La Rotonda near Venice. In both cases, the appeal lies in the chance to create an ordered island within a muddled sea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2547" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Villa_Rotonda_side.jpg" alt="640px-Villa_Rotonda_side" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the pleasures of order aren’t restricted to objects of high art. They are present when raking leaves in a garden or laying a table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2548" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6a00e54ed9ed5388330133f57bc127970b-800wi.jpg" alt="6a00e54ed9ed5388330133f57bc127970b-800wi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasures of order would also be present for anyone working on Japan’s high-speed trains. Here too, aboard gleaming carriages, one would have access to a more coherent, logical realm than private life allows for. As humans, we typically feel chaotic inside, confused and irritable, but the trains to which the railway workers devote their working lives suffer from none of these flaws.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its high points, work can permit us to create or maintain something that is ‘better’ than we normally are. The architect, the car designer, the waiter, the train engineer, whatever their differences in status and salaries, draw on a common satisfaction in their ability to create or manage small utopias in an otherwise chaotic, irrational and compromised world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2550" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/170517383.jpg" alt="Tokyo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Understanding</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then there is the pleasure of understanding. It is present in the working life of a plumber who must pin down what precisely is ailing the heating system within a myriad of pipes behind the kitchen panels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5407087789_835b5883a8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4340" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5407087789_835b5883a8_b.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="5407087789_835b5883a8_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the pleasure at the root of science, which seeks elegant principles that explain and control the apparent disorder of nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the pleasure of the writer, trying to put words to emotions, pinning down rare elusive butterflies of feeling, defining in language what the reader may have felt but never grasped so precisely before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding lends its possessor a thrilling sense of power over the randomness of experience. Through understanding, we acquire one of the keys, however small, to the laws of the universe – and our anxiety and fear decrease accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Money-making</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t just about greed. It’s about being rewarded in the most concrete way, financially, for grasping an aspect of life ahead of your peers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People had been walking past that old jam factory for years. But you were the one who realised what could be done: you could see what others couldn’t. You predicted that the area would change its character because you understood demographic and social change; you knew you could get people to buy apartments because you understood the role of marketing that you’d studied in the car industry. You, the entrepreneur, triumphed over those who were less intelligent about human nature. You can find and unlock value and the proof is the most tangible in the world, it isn’t just acclaim or the pat on the back of colleagues: it is the sum in your bank account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2552" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Derelict_Factory_-_Alperton_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_311079.jpg" alt="Derelict_Factory_-_Alperton_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_311079" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Derelict Factory, Alperton</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the same pleasure that moves the second hand book dealer at the market, the eBay reseller or the stockpickers in their studies at home. What others thought was junk, or couldn’t even see as valuable, you understood correctly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So those motivated to make money aren’t doing it just out of greed (though that might come into it of course). They may just be addicted to the intense satisfaction that a successful money-generating scheme can give off: the satisfaction – delivered via profit – of knowing that one has grasped some part of the world better than other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2553" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/167647400.jpg" alt="Marche Aux Puces -  Saint-Ouen is home to the Paris flea" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Serving</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The words ‘serving’ and ‘servant’ have extremely negative connotations. They sound feudal, an insult to our independence and pride. And yet to serve another human being offers some of the most intense pleasures available in the working world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A customer has just come in to your cafe; it’s breakfast time; they look a bit frazzled. It’s not a mystery what they need. You’re not trying to invent a new kind of coffee or a special way of cooking eggs. But it’s a delight to be able to bring these well-honed solutions to this person in just the right way. You are busy, but your smile is genuine. And you know that they are grateful – a breezy hello and crisp slice of toast really do help turn a tricky day into something bearable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6113290785_f0bb76de6e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6956" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6113290785_f0bb76de6e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="6113290785_f0bb76de6e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To serve well requires a practical application of the power of empathy. One has to start with oneself: What do I enjoy? What delights my eyes, ears and palate?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pleasing others is a sign that we’ve got it right, that we’ve correctly read ourselves and human nature more broadly. We’ve turned insight into a moment of joy or solace, which in turn lends us a sense of affirmation and triumph over the forces of unhappiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine it’s your job to design a new amenity kit for the business class of an airline. You’ve decided to add a shoehorn. And you’ve selected a leather case, rather than a soft fabric. It’s your taste that’s at work. You are sensitive to your own preferences and your hunch is that others will, given the chance, share it. You tune into your instincts and trust them. With leather, it has to be a particular colour and the stitching must be visible. You’re also keen on mints. At the end of a flight, that’s what you really like, especially as you don’t like using those little basins in the toilets. You didn’t wait for customers to tell you exactly what they wanted: you understood yourself and guessed what would please them. And now the results are in, and the satisfaction scores are off the scale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6376817609_5bc03dbc8c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6957" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/6376817609_5bc03dbc8c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="6376817609_5bc03dbc8c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To serve gives us a thrilling feeling of power in relation to the needs and vulnerabilities of others. They are looking to renew themselves with a haircut, to repair their faulty computer, to find something to soothe their ailing dog… – and we can be the ones to deliver the solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through certain kinds of work, we have the chance to contribute in some way to the great task of turning sadness and dissatisfaction into joy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2557" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/73635023-1.jpg" alt="Worried Pet Owners React To Massive Pet Food Recall" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Collaborating</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s 7.30 pm on a Friday night. In lots of other jobs, people would have packed it in ages ago. But you and eight colleagues are still hard at work. And you’re getting to know them in a way you never could around a kitchen table – because you have a shared purpose at last. You’re working together on a presentation for Monday – and it feels a bit like it did when you were eleven and you and some friends worked for hours on a tree house in the garden.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work lends us the pleasure of being part of a team. The challenge brings out everyone’s best sides: someone comes up with a suggestion you’d never have thought of, a colleague compensates for one of your weaknesses, another looks to you for encouragement and guidance that confirms your experience and authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collectively, a disparate group of people become more impressive than they each could be on their own – thanks to the gift of work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2559" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8369644728_8538b40b10_z.jpg" alt="8369644728_8538b40b10_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reminding ourselves of the possible pleasures of work helps to correct the misleading view that the only difficulty around employment is the part about getting hired. There’s a prior, equally big challenge of knowing what the ideal position for us would actually be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasures of work are extensions of things we normally first started to like in embryonic form when we were children. In our hurry to please authority figures or impress according to the status structure of the world, we often forget to ask ourselves what truly pleases us. Job categories (‘lawyer’, ‘IT specialist’ etc.) tell us what a person does, but they don’t sufficiently clearly latch on to the pleasure that’s subjectively involved in the task. We need another kind of categorisation which would help us to plot our pleasures: with it, we might say ‘I am motivated by Serving’ or ‘It’s Understanding that gets me going…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming to know ourselves better, remembering where the true sources of excitement and interest lie for us seems an indispensable step in the long path towards that eventual, infinitely tricky goal: the discovery of satisfying work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is in love with entrepreneurship. Starting your own business holds the same sort of prestigious position as, in previous ages, making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem or spearing multiple enemies in battle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1557" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/127481498.jpg" alt="A Celebration Of Music Hosted By Sean Parker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© WireImage</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur remains maddeningly elusive. Governments and public bodies do their best to encourage people by helping out with the practicalities: offering tax breaks, making failure less punitive, setting up ‘enterprise zones’ and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet at the kernel of successful entrepreneurship lies something oddly more abstract: <i>an accurate insight into the causes of human unhappiness.</i> Every morally-minded business is in some way alleviating a particular kind of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1558" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/135370827.jpg" alt="Apple's New Store In Grand Central Station Opens To Public" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because consumer society is now well-developed, it can be easy to think that everything must surely already have been done to please and satiate the audience, that every possible gimmick and thrill has been amply explored and indeed that we have far ‘too much stuff’ already. These concerns may then meld with an ecological concern for the diminishing resources of the planet – to create a view that we should henceforth aim for less and that capitalism is done for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, the theory that we have in some way come to the end of the road of entrepreneurial innovation, that everything has already been done, is conceptually impossible. The clearest evidence for this claim is that we are, most of us, still very unhappy in all sorts of fascinating (and in this context, inspiring) ways. Cheeringly for the entrepreneurial among us, the frustrations, irritations and griefs of the present are an inexhaustible source of raw materials out of which the businesses of the future can be built.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1559" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/143134495.jpg" alt="Dove Kicks Off National &quot;Show Us Your Skin&quot; Campaign In New York City" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get a measure of just how many new businesses still have to be invented – and therefore how much further capitalism has to develop – we need only take an average day and focus on how much annoys us and how much satisfies us from the moment we wake up to the time we fall back to sleep. Areas where we are fairly happy are those where further developments seem unnecessary. The market is evidently saturated and new entrants will face high degrees of competition that will only depress wages and profitability for all the players; while areas of dissatisfaction are, in essence, zones of unexplored opportunity. The greater the unhappiness, the bigger the potential market.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s imagine diary entries logging things it’s easy to feel quite happy about in a typical day:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Breakfast cereal: a huge choice, many of them very nice. Even the healthy ones have become satisfying as well as nutritious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Mobile phones: one gets clear reception, and is connected to a distant continent in a heartbeat. Things are working well here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Coffee: yet another outlet has opened nearby. The milk is perfect, the beans subtle and beguiling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Clothes: 32 different kinds of T-shirt are being offered at very reasonable prices. All the possibilities and permutations in this area have been explored.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1560" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/166205081.jpg" alt="Inside Fast Retailing's Uniqlo Store Ahead Of Earnings" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s plenty more to frustrate and depress us at other points in a typical day:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- An argument with one’s partner: it’s hard to know quite what is going on. This is the third this week. Why is it so hard to live together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Anxiety on the way into work: is one’s career on track, what is one doing this for, what happened to one’s youthful promise?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Children complaining about homework again: bored and listless.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Disgusting new block of flats going up at the end of the road: who did this? And why are they going to be so expensive?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1561" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/137249711.jpg" alt="London 2012 - Districts Of London - Stratford" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Beautiful restaurant but conversation with client sagging and dull. Why is it so hard to know what to talk about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Hard to calm down in the evening. Best to get a little drunk and check Twitter – a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One could go on; our griefs and irritations might fill dozens of pages, but already from the briefest sketch, one can discern the shape of some significant new businesses that might be pioneered in the future. For example: <i>a therapeutic service</i> to help couples in crisis. Given the importance of relationships compared with the relatively minor role occupied by luxury transport, if built properly, the business should theoretically exceed the revenues of BMW or Audi in a short time. <i>A career counselling service</i> would be just as necessary, one that worked properly, that was pleasant to visit, intelligently delivered, based on real science and that aimed to deliver clients with a vision of how to unite their talent with the needs of the world. <i>A new kind of school</i>: ideally, this would work back from the real problems of life in order to teach people things they actually needed to know, rather than forcing them through arcane scholastic exercises. <i>A property development firm</i> that accepted profits of 3% p.a (rather than the usual 15%+) and that set out to build efficient, beautiful houses for everyone. <i>A mobile phone app </i>designed to teach people how to have better conversations – rather than merely allowing them to have further conversations of the uninspiring kind they already have. <i>A new kind of monastery</i>, without religion, offering calm and retreat to those ground down by the tempests of modern life…</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everywhere one looks, there are frustrations and every one of them is – in theory – the seed of an enterprise. A first step towards entrepreneurship is hence to learn to study one’s own unhappiness, to register all one’s pulses of distress, however minor. Declining profits are in essence merely symptoms of giant failures of the imagination on the part of the business community: too many people throwing themselves at the same area, because they can’t think of anything more innovative to do than to start yet another airline, mobile phone company or supermarket chain – to the distress of all participants. By contrast, healthy profits are a reward for understanding and mastering a given human need ahead of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideas are not, of course, enough. There always comes the need to take care of practicalities and money; the requirement to raise bank loans, convince investors and find partners. But none of these practical steps stand any chance of working out if the original, psychological insight isn’t sound. And by the same token, if the insight is razor sharp, truly tailored to human functioning, then however arduous the journey, the business will stand a high chance of benefiting humanity and throwing off a little money too.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the UK, and some other parts of the developed world, unemployment continues to fall – if only very slightly. It’s good news. It’s something to cheer that productive forces in the economy are growing and that there is a little more money in people’s pockets.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if one gets more ambitious about human potential, a darker picture emerges – darker than that suggested by the figures from government bodies like the UK Office of National Statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2624" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentA.png" alt="PM-210214-unemploymentA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">UK unemployment (ILO) February 2014 © CESI</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should draw a further distinction. Employment means being, generically, in work. But misemployment means being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any real sincerity the true needs of other people: merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead. The way Primark, Patek Philippe and youporn.com might.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4335" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Dressing up as a hotdog to entice customers: misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man employed by the casino chain Las Vegas Sands to hand out flyers to tourists so as to entice them to use slot machines is clearly ‘employed’ in the technical sense. He’s marked as being off the unemployment registers. He is receiving a wage in return for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of the human condition of interest to his employers: that not enough tourists might otherwise leave the blue skies and cheerful bustle of a south Nevada city’s main street to enter the dark air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed casino lined with ranks of ringing consoles.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Misemployment in the logistics industry</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man is indeed employed, but in truth, he belongs to a large subsection of those in work we might term the ‘misemployed’. His labour is generating capital, but it is making no contribution to human welfare and flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and highly-sugared drinks (however delicious). The rate of misemployment in the economy might be very high.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2627" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentD.jpg" alt="This photo shows 11 June 1999 the exterior of Prix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects and construction workers were misemployed here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while we may be genuinely grateful for a job and give our best to do it well, at the back of our minds we do – as employees – nurture the hope that our work contributes in some real way to the common good; that we are making, modestly, a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just the most dramatically harmful kinds of work that register as misemployment. We intuitively recognise it when we think of work as ‘just a job’; when we sense that far too much of our time, effort and intelligence is spent on meetings that resolve little, on chivying people to sign up for products that – in our heart of hearts we don’t admire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Economists and governments have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy has been the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment has been to ‘stimulate demand.’</span></p>
<p class="p1">Though technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and misemployment.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2628" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentE.jpg" alt="INDIA-BRITAIN-ECONOMY-AUTO-BOLLYWOOD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Headlamp designers, paint engineers and models: all misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there are real solutions to bringing down the rate of misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se, the trick is to stimulate the right demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a nation properly concerned with misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. 20 per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another 30 per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5002" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg?resize=635%2C383" alt="FOX 2013 Summer TCA Tour - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1">Not yet gainfully employed</h5>
<p class="p1">To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the value of what is truly valuable and walk past what fails to address their true needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not suggesting the employment figures are irrelevant – they matter a great deal. They are the first thing to be attended to. All the same the raw figures mask a more ambitious index: are we deploying human capital admirably?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the few ambitions shared by politicians across the political spectrum is that of creating a fully meritocratic society, that is, a society in which all those who make it to the top do so only because of their own talents and abilities (rather than thanks to unfair privilege: upper-class parents, a friendship with the boss etc.). Throughout the Western world, all governments have (in theory!) the common goal of trying to create a hierarchy based on actual ability, replacing posh, chinless halfwits with the meritorious, wherever they may be found and whatever age, colour or gender they might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2768" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Obama.jpg" alt="Belgium EU Obama" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This meritocratic ideal has brought opportunity to millions. Gifted and intelligent individuals who for centuries were held down within an immobile, caste-like hierarchy, are now free to express their talents on a more or less level playing field. We have largely turned the page on a western world that was once filled with rulers who were too sick or stupid govern, lords who couldn’t manage their estates, commanders who didn’t understand the principles of battle, peasants who were brighter than their masters and maids who knew more than their mistresses. No longer is background an impassable obstacle to advancement. An element of justice has finally entered into the distribution of rewards.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2770" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leo.jpg" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - Sep 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/Moviestore</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is, inevitably, a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: for if we truly believe that we’ve created (or could even one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it necessarily follows that we have to hold the failures exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable, but also deserved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, succeeding financially (without inheritance or contacts) in an economic meritocracy endows individuals with an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old, who had been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel. But, at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also thankfully been spared. The question of why, if one is in any way good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2771" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/London-1.jpg" alt="Children In Tower Hamlets Are Poorest In The UK According To Latest Research" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There has turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the poor. For a certain constituency, it is clear (and perhaps even scientifically provable) that the poor owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy. With the rise of an economic meritocracy, in certain quarters, the poor have moved from being described as ‘unfortunate’, the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally-minded rich, to being described as ‘failures’, fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust self-made individuals, who are disinclined to feel ashamed about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they have escaped. In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in the fertile corners of meritocratic societies, it has become possible to argue that the social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder and so that conditions are already in place for good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder – attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures or simple compassion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2769" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Thatcher.jpg" alt="Miners' strike" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© PA/PA Wire/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the sociologist Michael Young who first explored the downside of a belief in a supposedly just social system. ‘Today all persons, however humble, know they have had every chance,’ he explained in The Rise of the Meritocracy. ‘If they have been labelled “dunce” repeatedly they cannot any longer pretend…  Are they not bound to recognise that they have an inferior status, not as in the past because they were denied opportunity, but because they are inferior?’ To the injury of poverty, a meritocratic system has added the insult of shame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2772" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Cameron-1.jpg" alt="Conservative policy on poverty" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Stefan Rousseau/PA Archive/Press Association Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a symptom of our greater faith in meritocracy that it’s largely become impossible to explain away our failures as the result of ‘bad luck.’ While it is granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping the course of our careers, the evaluation of people proceeds, in practical terms, as if they could fairly be held responsible for their biographies. It would seem unduly (and even suspiciously) modest to ascribe a victory to ‘good luck’ and, more importantly in this context, pitiable to blame defeat on the opposite. Winners make their own luck, insists the modern mantra: which would, for example, have puzzled the ancient Roman worshippers of the Goddess of Fortune. It is alarming enough to have to depend for our status on contingent elements. It is harder yet to live in a world so imbued with notions of rational control that it has largely dismissed ‘bad luck’ as a credible explanation for defeat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But of course, there never can be a truly meritocratic system, because the ‘merit’ of an individual is far too complex and subtle a thing to be determined by what job you have. Those who have faith in meritocracy are essentially subscribing to an insane, and certainly arrogant assumption that ordinary humans (employers, customers) can handily take over the solemn responsibilities that past ages more wisely left in the hands of a God who, helped along by the angels, was due to weigh the souls of each person on the Day Judgement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2773" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dayjudgement.jpg" alt="Dayjudgement" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Hans Memling, <em>The Last Judgement</em> (1467–1471)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To free ourselves from some of the more punishing side-effects of a meritocratic worldview, it would be wise to cease investing something as haphazardly distributed as jobs and money with moral connotations – and to retain a little of the old-fashioned, modest belief in a distinction between what someone earns and what their souls are like.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Arts graduates across the developed world complain bitterly about the difficulties they are facing finding employment. They spend long and costly years studying such subjects as history, art, philosophy, poetry and drama – then they reach the jobs market, and discover that no one has any use for their distinctive skills and interests. If they’re extremely lucky, they may find some kind of job, but it will almost certainly have no connection with what they studied or pay very much. A great number end up making coffee while deeply resenting – against the backdrop of frothing milk and roasting beans – how their years studying Foucault or Herodotus seem to have gone absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is tempting to dismiss such moans: if someone wants to spend their time finding out about post-colonial theory, reading South American novels or deconstructing vampire films, then that’s very nice – as a hobby. But it’s harder to see why anyone should expect to get paid for doing so. You don’t get paid for going to the cinema or attending parties either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, the extraordinary rate of unemployment – or misemployment – of graduates in the humanities is a sign of something grievously wrong with modern societies and their university systems. It’s evidence that we have no real clue what the humanities, including culture and art, are really for. We pay them a certain amount of lip-service, we like to declare them worthy and noble and fund a few professors to dig away in their archives, but basically, as societies, we don’t know what the humanities could do for us and therefore, how people trained in them should spend their days other than in preparing Frappuccinos.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2140" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateA.jpg" alt="Earns Starbucks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© PA Ted S. Warren/AP/Press Association Images</h6>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Seemingly the only option after three years studying post-colonial theory or the poetry of Lucretius</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem lies squarely with the universities. If you ask these universities why young people should bother to study history or literature, they can’t give a straight answer. Fearing that they cannot compete effectively against practical departments like physics or computer science, faculties in the humanities take refuge in ambiguity and silence, having carefully calculated that they retain just enough prestige to get away with leaving the reasons for their existence somewhat murky. Instead, they make their students perform a range of deeply arcane manoeuvres. For example, a BA in philosophy at the university of Oxford currently requires you to achieve familiarity with metaphysics (substance, individuation, universals) and to do a thesis on concepts of intentionality in Quine, Frege or Putnam. An equivalent degree in English literature is awarded to those who can successfully tackle The Waste Land on allegorical and anagogic levels and trace the influence of Seneca’s dramatic theories on the development of Jacobean theatre.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2142" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Rex/OJO Images</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">This stuff could change your life – if it was taught in the right way</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This represents a gross neglect of what the humanities are really for: they are for helping us to live and to die. The humanities are the closest things we have to a replacement for religion. They are a storehouse of vitally important knowledge about how to lead our lives: novels teach us about relationships, works of art reframe our perspectives, drama provides us with cathartic experiences, history is a catalogue of case-studies into any number of personal and political scenarios. Like the religions of old, culture is there to have a therapeutic effect on us; which is why it matters so much in a troubled world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in order to bring out this therapeutic effect, we need to reinvent universities. Departments like ‘history’ and ‘literature’ operate under superficial categories which don’t throw the spotlight on the important aspects of the material they are dealing with. So in the redesigned universities of the future, there would be a Department for Relationships, an Institute of Dying and a Centre for Self-Knowledge. There would be centres of expertise on changing jobs and improving bonds with children, reconnecting with nature and facing illness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2145" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270214-graduateE.jpg" alt="PM-270214-graduateE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2">A future Department for Relationships, where literature would be assigned to therapeutic ends</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One would still study novels, histories, plays, psychoanalysis and paintings, but one would do so for explicitly therapeutic ends. So Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary would be assigned in a course on ‘How to manage the tensions of marriage’ instead of belonging in a course on ‘Trends in nineteenth-century fiction’, just as the works of Epicurus and Seneca would appear in a course on ‘How to Die’ rather than in one on ‘Hellenistic philosophy’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One would witness a surge in demand from the population at large for the services of people trained in culture in this new way – given that no one currently knows how to run a relationship, everyone is confused about bringing up kids, few of us have a clue how to manage our anxieties and death is universally terrifying.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unemployment of arts graduates is shameful and unnecessary because culture has answers and highly useful consolations to the urgent dilemmas of real people. We just need to get these insights out, package them properly, and commercialise them adequately, so that the armies of people currently serving coffee can put their minds to proper use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We aren’t creatures who need only practical things like food and drink, cement and running shoes. We also desperately crave nourishment for what we might as well, with no superficial associations, call our souls. This soul-related work should become a huge and legitimate part of the world economy, worth as many billions as the cement trade.</span></p>
