				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to get irritated by people who are very concerned about details. They are bothered by a comma, in the wrong place (that was on purpose); they get upset if the dishwasher is stacked in a suboptimal way; it takes them a month to select a colour to repaint the bedroom; they know the price of a paper clip or count the number of emails they send in a week. We’ve got some pretty negative names for their attitude: they are pernickety, obsessive, perfectionist, pedantic. They lack a sense of proportion; behind their backs we mock them for their absurd devotion.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in literature and the arts, there’s a different view of fussiness; here it seems like a prestigious virtue. </span></p>
<p>In poetry, changing a few words makes the difference between something that can live for generations and and a nice enough effort that sinks with hardly a trace. T.S. Eliot, for instance, had a poem sitting in his desk drawer for years.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/books121709_04.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9832" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/books121709_04.jpeg?resize=635%2C445" alt="books121709_04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He eventually showed it to his very fussy friend Ezra Pound, who suggested a multitude of cuts and changes to the wording. Thanks to Pound’s obsessive concern with detail, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Waste Land</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was eventually published in 1922 and has been voted the greatest poem of the 20th century.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ezra_Pound_2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9833" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ezra_Pound_2.jpg?resize=635%2C654" alt="NPG Ax7811; Ezra Pound by Alvin Langdon Coburn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Ezra Pound: the fussy friend who made <i>The Waste Land</i> the greatest poem of the 20th century</h5>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9839" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.png?resize=500%2C628" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Waste Land</em> &#8211; with Pound’s fussy notes</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crucial point about fussiness in such cases is that it is carefully targeted. The creative fusspot has a big idea about why it’s important to focus with such intensity on certain details. This sense of an overarching purpose helps us see the difference between art at its best and its mediocre versions. Great artists are incredibly obsessed about detail &#8211; but not about just any detail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modestly able painter might try to rival a photograph: they want to show every detail of what they see. When painting a portrait they set out to show as accurately as possible what a person looks like. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9834" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d.jpg?resize=635%2C776" alt="23d00935c5bde317e476ff105fdc7a2d" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Winterhalter was careful to show the exact shape of her earlobe and every strand of hair curling over her neck</h5>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9835" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse.jpg?resize=622%2C649" alt="Young-Woman-in-a-Blue-Blouse" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Matisse didn’t care about the exact shape of her ears</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great artists &#8211; by contrast &#8211; are rigorously selective. Matisse was massively interested in colour contrasts and harmonies and went to endless trouble to get exactly the right shade of blue for the background. But he didn’t care at all about individual strands of hair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great artists&#8217;s ideas about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">which</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> details to focus on are guided by a key question: what am I trying to convey here, what’s my task and goal? If the aim is to capture the essence of a personality then not every detail is equally important. A detail becomes eloquent because of the work it does. The great artist is guided by the needs of the beholder. They are always asking: why is this particular detail helpful to the viewer? </span></p>
<p>Artists and writers don’t usually see themselves as primarily engaged in commerce. Although ironically their best achievements often turn out to be amongst the most economically rewarding of all investments: a Matisse painting bought in the 1930s for the same price as a small family car would buy a private jet today.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can take the lessons about details in art and use them in thinking about commercial enterprise. Around business some details might matter hugely, others might be unimportant.  Ideally, a business should define its overarching aim and then work out which details it really needs to get fussy about and, equally, understand which ones can be safely ignored.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22004863999_c02983d56a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9846" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22004863999_c02983d56a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="22004863999_c02983d56a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see some cases where this hasn’t happened. An airline, in its key business class service, offers six kinds of champagne, but the cabin temperature is often too hot or cold. If one is stifling or freezing, the particular brand of champagne one is drinking won’t matter very much. Or a car company might have invested hugely to shave two seconds off the time in which the vehicle can accelerate from 0-60 mph &#8211; although almost no one will ever put this to the test. But the dashboard layout isn’t very elegant &#8211; even though this is something you look at all the time. Their interest in details hasn’t tracked the ingredients of the master-goal: a happy driving experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, a company would deploy fussiness strategically to advance its core ambitions. A hotel that’s really focused on helping one get a good night’s sleep might not fret too much about what kind of chocolate is in the mini bar. Because finding the perfect chocolate isn’t much linked to repose. But whether the fridge hums is a crucial issue &#8211; as is the sound of the bathroom extractor fan and the sound a neighbor&#8217;s door makes when opened and closed late at night or in the early morning. An obsession with silent doors could be a major item in an advertising campaign.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4713209358_99b7a8195e_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9848" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4713209358_99b7a8195e_b.jpg?resize=635%2C652" alt="4713209358_99b7a8195e_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What actually bothers us about fussy people is not that they are interested in detail &#8211; but rather that we sense that they are focused on the wrong details &#8211; that is, on unimportant ones. Businesses need to recruit and honour fussy people &#8211; because fussiness well directed is a key to commercial success. The person who is, at the moment, preoccupied by wiping dust from their computer screen or stacking piles of documents neatly doesn’t need to relax and stop being so fussy. They just need to find a more worthy and commercially significant target for their wonderful ability to get obsessive about details.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the ideas that circulates below the surface of modern life is that work diminishes our personalities. We get paid in return for giving up a vital part of who we are. We look forward to holidays and retirement in order to nurture our true selves.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This analysis is a legacy of the Romantic movement. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, influential writers, artists and philosophers developed the view that the kind of work most people actually do &#8211; management, sales, manufacturing, logistics &#8211; is detrimental to the human spirit. The only exceptions to this analysis were a few jobs that were, and remain, not widely available in most societies: being a poet, novelist or artist. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/byron7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8745" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/byron7.jpg?resize=635%2C565" alt="byron7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Lord Byron: an influence on the assessment of modern logistics</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas (who spent some time in the US), often painted the deeply unheroic characteristics of the trading world. His brokers and speculators are presented as people who have a limited outlook. They are dull, uninspiring figures. They confirm our worst fears about how we might end up, after years in trade.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8746" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016.jpg?resize=635%2C501" alt="Edgar_Germain_Hilaire_Degas_016" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edgar Degas, <em>Bureau du coton à la Nouvelle-Orléans</em>, 1873</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only when we are off work that we can begin to be the interesting, real version of who we are.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8747" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251.jpg?resize=635%2C532" alt="db_CYRIL_MANN__British_1911-1980__Dark_Satanic_Mills__19251" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dark Satanic Mills</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Cyril Mann, 1925</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1840s, Henri Daumier won great success portraying lawyers as arrogant, greedy and dishonest. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8529946222_6b27d54379_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8748" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/8529946222_6b27d54379_b.jpg?resize=635%2C401" alt="8529946222_6b27d54379_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may not have started out that way &#8211; they may have been eager reformers and crusaders for justice. But it was a profession (like most others) designed, Daumier thought, to crush anyone’s better nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our culture has taken to heart this sad Romantic notion of work. Sometimes it is more than deserved. But there is an important alternative view, which starts by being alive to some of the drawbacks of the Romantic idealisation of ‘home’. Of course there can be some pleasant times over the kitchen table on the weekend, but life outside of work is often full of challenges, humiliations and displays of the very worst kinds of behaviour. Home can be where we’re short of skills; a place of difficulty. One longs for Monday morning, for sanity to return.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fd100007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8749" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Fd100007.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Fd100007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>He goes to the office to calm down; she finds it easier to run her business than manage her marriage</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our labour is not merely something we unfortunately have to do; it is ideally part of our development. Work is a place where we can learn the skills &#8211; and ultimately the maturity &#8211; that we might otherwise be very short of in the rest of our lives. Via the experience of work we might develop some crucial abilities:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Learn</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSF0830-Edit__924x0__.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DSF0830-Edit__924x0__.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="_DSF0830-Edit__924x0__" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most workplaces are devoted to the idea of the progression and development of employees. They know how much easier it is to work with who they have, rather than constantly part ways with people. The fact that someone doesn’t yet know how to make an excellent presentation or how to manage an IT team isn’t seen as terminal. They can learn. They can do a course; get some practice; find a mentor, be assessed to check they’re making good enough progress. They can sit down with someone and determine what didn’t go so well and focus on what needs to be improved. Work has an idea of development inherent within it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, the domestic sphere is opposed to learning. We’re meant to know it all already: how to be a good friend, lover and parent. Except we generally have no clue &#8211; and never make much progress.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to express truths without causing upset</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Business life constantly gives us lessons in the art of how to tell someone a tricky bit of information without them panicking or being horrified. Home life finds us far less tactful.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/677_10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8751" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/677_10.jpg?resize=635%2C666" alt="677_10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>In need of classes on feedback</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We say nothing and fester or are brutal and give the blunt version of the hard facts. There are tears and slammed doors. </span></p>
<p>Clever businesses know they need to be experts in the arts of good communication. They can only function well because tricky news reaches the people who need to know it without destroying their esteem. So negative facts are not regarded in a personal light; there’s a protocol of giving plenty of support before firing the arrow, and there are traditions in which being open to criticism is seen as a major mark of character.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to listen to strange views</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romantic love is based on the notion of perfect agreement. One gets together with people because they see the world as one does. It’s a beautiful ideal &#8211; until there are conflicts, at which point the entire edifice of a relationship may be called into question. If we loved one another, would we ever disagree or see things differently?</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Rembrandt_-_De_Staalmeesters-_het_college_van_staalmeesters_waardijns_van_het_Amsterdamse_lakenbereidersgilde_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8752" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Rembrandt_-_De_Staalmeesters-_het_college_van_staalmeesters_waardijns_van_het_Amsterdamse_lakenbereidersgilde_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="800px-Rembrandt_-_De_Staalmeesters-_het_college_van_staalmeesters_(waardijns)_van_het_Amsterdamse_lakenbereidersgilde_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rembrandt: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>The Cloth Merchant’s Syndicate</em>, 1662</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Work isn’t like this. These people (painted by Rembrandt in the 17th century) were the members of a ratings agency: grading the quality of bales of cloth, so that merchants could trade with confidence. This was central to Dutch trade. Each of the six individuals around the table has a very distinct personality, and would have come at many issues from quite alternative perspectives and yet they are united by the task at hand. They seem to bring their better selves to work: one imagines them as good at solving disagreements; they would have listened to each other with respect (‘I see your point; however, I wonder if perhaps …).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to be patient with fiddly things</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_Il_Tagliapanni_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8753" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_Il_Tagliapanni_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=550%2C639" alt="Giovanni_Battista_Moroni_-_The_Tailor_('Il_Tagliapanni')_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost all work is fiddly. It requires patience, it demands that we slow ourselves down and master hurdles. The cloth cutter has had to put aside a lot of his natural wildness and impulsiveness in order to make his living. To learn the trade means not just to acquire a means to earn money; it’s a coded lesson in growing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the Romantic view, it might be that we are quite often simply the better version of ourselves at work. We’re more dignified and more patient, more tolerant and more loveable. Furthermore, we are developing skills that &#8211; tantalisingly &#8211; are needed and can be used elsewhere, especially in the bedroom and kitchen. Rather than leaving work in order to relax, it might be that we need to come to work in order to be a better person and lover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As yet we’re not quite fully focused on this potential and so don’t see how big a contribution work could be making to our private lives. Being a good employee shouldn’t be that different from being that truly important thing, a good person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we were sketching the utopia, we’d not be looking for a society in which people didn’t have to work. It would be one in which many more people had the chance to acquire via their work the skills which would be useful to them across the whole of their lives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">When companies think about innovating new products and services (or just testing their existing ones), they know that the task before them is to find out what their customers are really looking for.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How do you discover this? Generally, companies do one very plausible, but in fact very problematic thing. They go and ask the customer. However, strangely, if you really want to know what your customer wants, the last thing you should do is to go out and ask them. And for a simple reason: they won’t know.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4071171742_e69ed989ae_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7109" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4071171742_e69ed989ae_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4071171742_e69ed989ae_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">Companies have traditionally followed the methods of the social sciences and gone in for</span> large data samples and in-depth interviews. The questionnaire on the one hand and the focus group on the other have been mainstays of company research programmes for many decades. But these approaches have a crucial limitation built into them. They assume that other people already know pretty well what it is they are looking for &#8211; and the only thing one needs to do is ask them, collect the data, and move forward. However, the big and rather strange truth is that your customers don’t really know what they want. They can’t give you &#8211; ready made &#8211; the answers you seek.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The phenomenon becomes more obvious when you consider the case of art. It would be very odd indeed if an artist were to use a focus group to arrive at an answer to the question of what to paint or write next. We sense that this would be asking too much of the audience. How could they know that what they really wanted was <em>In Search of Lost Time</em> or a tender romantic comedy about two people meeting on an Austrian train (<em>Before Midnight</em>)? W</span>e wouldn’t have been able to say what the gap in our lives was until a given artist filled it in. Hence the apparent ‘creative’ magic of the artist: they know us, but better than we know ourselves.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Or, to return to business, no one could have invented the Post-it note simply on the basis of a survey of what most customers walking into stationery shops were after. It’s only once we see certain products that we realise that, in fact, in a vague inarticulate way, we wanted them all along. We have the needs, but we can’t pin them down. A central task of creative thinking is therefore to be the detector and interpreter of the unspoken and &#8211; up to that point &#8211; hidden needs of mankind. Surveys &#8211; for all their other merits &#8211; can never do this, for the big reason that we just don’t know our needs well enough. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So the real secret to understanding customer-needs lies elsewhere; in using the tools of <em>Introspection</em> and <em>Empathy</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">a) Introspection</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Introspection means using oneself as the central instrument of detection, focused on one’s sources of private joy and unhappiness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need some very fine-grained data that hasn’t made it into public language, and therefore won’t be picked up by surveys; data that has the quality of artistic insights, though it won’t be used for art. Businesses of the future are built up on tremors of inner thrill and distress &#8211; tremors that haven’t made it into language, that aren’t in circulation, but that if one attends to them, can lead to amazingly true and lucrative things.</span></p>
<p class="p2">This is how the in-car cup holder was &#8211; at last &#8211; invented.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01922/Cup-holder_1922913c.jpg?resize=460%2C287" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">One of the key things you need to do in a car is to have a place to put a drink. But for most of the history of car production, a drink for the driver was a hard thought for a car company to have or for customers to express, though, of course, people were always balancing drinks on their knees or wedging styrofoam cups into little clefts between bags (and praying they wouldn’t have to do an emergency stop). But the productive idea that there could just be a little thing connected to the dashboard that would solve this problem didn’t emerge until 1983, with the launch of the Dodge Caravan. Recognition of the need for a cup holder was inhibited. There was huge emphasis on the <em>driving</em> experience &#8211; that is on all the things <em>essential</em> to driving: the angle of the seat, feel of the grip of the steering wheel, the ease with which one could view the speedometer while turning a corner… all these received minute, careful attention. But the incidental concern (from the point of view of actually driving, that is) of taking a sip of orange juice at the traffic lights languished until 1983.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The American writer Emerson once wrote: ‘In the minds of geniuses we find, once more, our own neglected thoughts.’ Likewise, in the minds of car-design geniuses,  our own neglected thoughts and needs are identified &#8211; and acted upon. And hundreds of millions of journeys are made a little bit nicer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857_retouched.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7119" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857_retouched.jpg?resize=635%2C574" alt="Ralph_Waldo_Emerson_ca1857_retouched" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2">Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1857</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Now that the cereal bar exists, we can see that it fits in with many needs: it’s quite healthy, it’s convenient, it’s tasty and it’s inexpensive to produce. But, though it now seems an obvious kind of product, the cereal bar was very slow to arrive on the market. There had been many kinds of sweet bars and many kinds of cereal for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7094" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/5574813879_98f3741212_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5574813879_98f3741212_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The root of the problem is that the cereal bar is essentially just a few bits of dry cereal. And originally cereal wasn’t intended to be eaten dry. But the fact is, eating dry cereal is rather nice. Many many people must have had this experience, without taking it seriously. They’d scoop a handful of cornflakes while someone else was pouring the milk and munch away happily. They didn’t realise that they were having an experience which &#8211; if commercialised &#8211; could found a large industry and send lorries around the country delivering repacked dry cereal to tens of thousands of retail outlets. Great ideas don’t always feel like brilliant insights. They (unfortunately) can easily feel like completely humdrum, low-status, trivial thoughts. The fear of being boring or weird continues to quash an enormous number of good ideas. </span></p>
<p class="p2">This only changed in 1975, when an inventor called Stanley Mason (also responsible for the squeezable ketchup bottle and for the dental floss dispenser) came up with the idea of granola bar. In 2015, in the US alone, the cereal bar market was worth $5 billion.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/media2.onsugar.com/files/2013/04/16/1/192/1922195/9933e12f6488395a_Crunchy-Granola-Bars.jpg?resize=301%2C414" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">In the minds of geniuses, we rediscover our own neglected thoughts (Emerson)</span></h5>
<p class="p2">The difference between the creative and the uncreative mind &#8211; Emerson was saying &#8211; isn’t that the creative person has <em>different</em> thoughts. Both have roughly the same ones. It’s just that the creative mind takes them seriously, while the uncreative one discards them. What enables them to do this is a quality very dear to Emerson, independence, a freedom from group thinking: a capacity to be thought odd by many for a time in order to hold onto one’s own desires.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Edward Hopper certainly wasn’t the first person to feel the lonely charm of the railway station or the strangely comforting anonymity of the late-night diner or the eeriness of Sunday in the suburbs. People had been primed to dislike or ignore these situations, so they didn’t give weight to such low-status moments. But Hopper became a great artist by being acutely loyal to a family of strangely important experiences that many people had, but had hitherto ignored.</span></p>

<h5 class="p2">Edward Hopper, <em>Pennsylvania Coal Town</em> (1947)</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Picasso described a similar move to a photographer, George Brassaï, who was visiting his studio in 1943. They were looking at his Bull Head, made the year before.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7096" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.png?resize=635%2C588" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Picasso,<em> Bull&#8217;s Head</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> (</span>1942)</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">‘Guess how I made the bull&#8217;s head?’ Picasso asked. ‘One day, in a pile of objects all jumbled up together, I found an old bicycle seat right next to a rusty set of handlebars. In a flash, they joined together in my head. The idea of the <em>Bull&#8217;s Head</em> came to me before I had a chance to think. All I did was weld them together&#8230;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you were only to see the bull&#8217;s head and not the bicycle seat and handlebars that form it, the sculpture would lose some of its impact.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In bicycle repair shops, scrap-heaps and people backyards, there could have been many occasions when people playfully thought that handle-bars are a bit like horns or that a seat sort of looks like an animal’s head. But no one thought to take this seriously and make the best possible version of it &#8211; until Picasso came along and did so. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Today we might typically see the artist as someone who is at odds with Capitalism, who breaks rules, who goes to wild parties and who relishes unsettling experiences.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Emin-My-Bed.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7097" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Emin-My-Bed.jpg?resize=635%2C457" alt="Emin-My-Bed" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Tracey Emin, <em>My Bed</em> (1998)</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But really, the underlying ambition of the artist is not at all like this. The mission of the true artist is to identify, and commodify, precious experiences. The process of looking carefully at what has been overlooked is common ground for good art and good business; the good business thinker is in effect an artist &#8211; and the good artist is a fledgling entrepreneur.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">b) Empathy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>What is empathy?</strong> Normally we use<em> sympathy</em> and <em>empathy</em> rather interchangeably but they can be used to mark out an important difference. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Sympathy:</strong> This is when you feel close to someone on the basis of a shared experience. Even if you’re not having that experience right now, you clearly remember having it and can tap into that memory to grasp what’s going on for the other person. If you really struggled with maths homework and now your child does, you sympathise with their difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3199575758_65e1a605f5_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7123" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3199575758_65e1a605f5_b.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="3199575758_65e1a605f5_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>Empathy:</strong> This is a trickier phenomenon. It happens when you haven’t had a certain kind of experience, but you can combine bits of your imaginative memory to explore what it would be like. If you found maths easy and always dashed off your homework with zero fuss, but your child frets, gets stuck at every point, resists and weeps, you can’t use <em>sympathy</em> to get inside their experience. If they say ‘you don’t know what it’s like’, they’re actually right in this case: you don’t. But that’s not the end of the story. Because we can use our imagination to build bridges from things we do know about from the inside to this new territory. You know what it’s like to be frustrated. You understand the fear of humiliation. You know what it’s like to feel that something is maddeningly incomprehensible &#8211; last week you tried to reset the timer on the new oven. From these relevant fragments you can imaginatively piece together a feel for something you’ve never directly experienced yourself: bewildered rage directed at the apex of an isosceles triangle. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So empathy gives a confident woman the possibility of grasping what it might be like to be a shy man in a sports club changing room or enables the CFO of a major company to feel tenderness for the concerns of an under-appreciated poet. (In practice, though, we only occasionally get round to undertaking the required empathetic exercises.) </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Empathy is the capacity to enter into the hidden desires and unspoken needs and pains of people who are not from your tribe. It allows us to take seriously what might it be like to be someone else. Empathy is also a crucial factor in the growth of many enterprises &#8211; and the lack of it is a huge (though easily ignored) obstacle to success.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><strong>So how can we get into the minds of other people? </strong>The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu says that, when we meditate, the ego can be overcome and we should be able to inhabit anything via the imagination. We can, for a time, cease to be ourselves and feel our way into being anything on the planet: wind, trees, rocks, rivers, a lonely child, a powerful king. The mind can be everywhere. Lao Tzu even puts forward a weird but fruitfully poetic idea that the whole world is really one mind, one thing, and that only fear separates us and makes us individuated. It’s a fanciful idea, and not literally true, but it’s getting at something important. It’s an emphatic assertion of a crucial insight that can be restated in simpler terms: we can use our imagination to identify with things we’re not.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7433953100_814581e2dc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7099" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7433953100_814581e2dc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="7433953100_814581e2dc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2">Lao Tzu: an invitation to be, for a time, the rocks, the sea, the clouds.</h5>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">We need to get used to flexing our empathetic muscles. </span></strong>The easiest way to do this is to imagine what it might be like to be a man or a woman, whichever of the two we are not. It means wondering what would it be like to wear tights, or to have an erection or to have breasts.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/img.thesun.co.uk/aidemitlum/archive/01566/Sean_Bean__1566553a.jpg?resize=300%2C450" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The fact that we don’t readily explore these possibilities alerts us to something key. Fear holds us back. </span>We’re very wedded to maintaining the point of view we’ve already formed. We’ve made a host of choices about the kind of person we are, and we’re inclined to defend them. The imaginative exercise at the heart of empathy &#8211; imagining yourself as other than you are &#8211; gives rise to a range of anxieties.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might discover that some of our choices are actually not very good or compelling; that we were wrong in thinking we had to live the way we do. But we’re already deeply invested in our life and it’s terrifying to think of unwinding those commitments. What if it would have  been better, after all, to live as a woman or a man?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might discover we are gayer than we think, which could be very threatening if we’ve lived in an environment that makes a big issue of this. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- We might be so scared of poverty or age that we’re deeply uncomfortable with really letting our minds settle into the thought experiment of supposing we were chronically short of money or that we were already nearing the end of our lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our anxieties inhibit our capacity for empathy. We need help.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Novelists are the world&#8217;s masters at empathy. We can learn a lot about empathy by looking at their work.</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image09.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7102" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image09.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1"> Trying out what it might be like to be a Roman Emperor</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In a long novel, published in 1951, entitled <em>Memoirs of Hadrian,</em> the French writer Marguerite Yourcenar set herself a huge task around empathy. She wanted to write not simply about the Roman emperor Hadrian, she wanted to write from his point of view. And to do that she’d have to enter imaginatively into what it was like to be him. She was a woman, living in a small flat in New York, used to taking taxis and boiling the kettle, whose direct experience of power might have been limited to hiring someone to repaint the bedroom. Hadrian was master of the known world. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">She did lots of research. She found out about Roman history, she read up on their religious assumptions, the background horizon and politics, the structure of family life, what they had for dinner, how the postal-system operated and how many slaves an emperor might have. But she wasn’t only trying to find out about Hadrian’s world. She was asking a more radical and creative question: what would it be like actually to be him?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7126" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="Bust_of_Hadrian_in_the_Musei_Capitolini_MC817" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2">Marble bust of Hadrian</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do you need to consider to &#8216;be&#8217; in the shoes of someone else? How to overcome all the assumptions about existence that are (to you) normally &#8216;invisible&#8217; &#8211; the deep unspoken picture of normality we carry around with us all the time? It’s so familiar, we tend not even to notice it’s there. But it simply doesn’t apply to the lives of many other people. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">So in order to get herself into Hadrian’s toga, Yourcenar posed a series of questions to herself. To find out what it would be like to be someone else she asked: </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what&#8217;s my body like?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how much money do I have?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what am I scared of?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what&#8217;s my life expectancy?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how do I feel about death?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how will I be judged a success or a failure? What&#8217;s expected of me?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what turns me on?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what makes me angry?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- if I wake at 3am, what thoughts run through my head? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how do i feel about my own appearance? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- what do I want?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">- how does time look to me?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To expand our capacity for customer empathy, <span class="Apple-converted-space"> l</span>ike a novelist, we need to take ourselves imaginatively into the bodies, fears, hopes, frustrations and loves of another person. But the goal isn&#8217;t to write a novel, it&#8217;s to generate more effective products and services. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>1. THE INCUBATOR</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In Nepal &#8211; as in other parts of the developing world &#8211; there is a high rate of infant mortality. Babies die from </span>conditions that in other countries would be non-fatal because the baby could be cared for in an incubator.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> In 2008, a team from Stanford University set out to address the problem and increase the number of incubators available. At first, one might think this was primarily a matter of how to finance the supply of additional incubators. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But a more empathic approach revealed that the problem had other &#8211; very different &#8211; dimensions. Most of the children who needed such care won’t, in fact, be in hospital. And there won’t be access to electricity. The staff using them won’t have elaborate training. To be effective, it was necessary to design a new kind of incubator that would be easily transportable, wouldn’t require power, would be simple to operate, clean and easy to maintain and not too costly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image33.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7103" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image33.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="image33" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Embrace</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The team created a product which doesn’t look at all like a modern high-tech incubator. It’s a sort of bag, rather than a kind of ultra-sophisticated box.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But it does many of the same things well. And its cost was utterly transformed from about $20,000 to around $25 per unit. The problem was solved not by a new scientific discovery (all the relevant science was already in circulation) but by a wonderful exercise of empathy. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">2. THE SHORTCUT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many small areas of urban greenery &#8211; which have been carefully provided with bitumen paths &#8211; are crisscrossed by worn-down trails over the grass where people have taken shortcuts. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7094286453_af092c55e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7104" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/7094286453_af092c55e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="7094286453_af092c55e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Flickr/Alan Stanton</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The shortcut is a small &#8211; but revealing &#8211; instance of a practical failure of empathy. The landscape architects who plotted the official paths didn’t sufficiently think themselves into the lives of other people. The designers may themselves not mind taking a slightly longer route round the edge of a grassy area. Their professional enthusiasm leads them instinctively to avoid damaging the grass. But most people don’t feel that way at all. They aren’t thinking of the delicate new shoots, they’re just in a hurry to get wherever they’re going. If the planning process had included a dedicated session on empathy they’d have re-routed the path &#8211; or added a new one &#8211; to follow the course that, to most people, makes most sense. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">3. HOTEL NOISE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’re in a hotel room on a warm night. It’s a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>relief that the room has air conditioning and when you arrived a helpful porter explained how you set it to the ideal temperature. But in the quiet of the night you realise there’s a problem. The cooling system makes an uncomfortably loud clicking noise. You try to ignore it. It seems to get louder. You reconcile yourself as best you can to a miserable night and make a vow never to return to this place. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The management of the hotel have failed in empathy. In this case they had an unusually concrete opportunity to put themselves in the shoes of others. Before installing this air conditioning system, some very senior person should have undertaken the empathic experiment of passing a night in its company. (In the process they might also have discovered that it takes several bewildering minutes to master the lighting switches and the the cord of the hairdryer is inconveniently short.)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> They didn’t build enough empathy into their decisons, so they didn’t test the experience<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>of the guest strongly enough. And now their repeat business is suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">4. &#8216;SQUISHY GRIP&#8217; ORAL B</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You’d think that the handle of a kid’s toothbrush should be thinner than one designed for adults. Obviously, children’s hands are smaller, so you reduce the proportions. And that’s how it was from the first children’s brushes until very recently. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oralB_gripper_hero_626px.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7107" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/oralB_gripper_hero_626px.jpg?resize=635%2C314" alt="oralB_gripper_hero_626px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But all along, the industry hadn’t paid attention to something: children typically hold the brush a different way. They make a fist, rather than mainly use their fingers (which is how adults tend to do it). For the whole-hand technique, it’s actually better to have a fatter, softer handle. By looking carefully at what children actually did with toothbrushes, Oral-B came up with the ‘squishy grip’, a big fat squashy handle. It makes it easier for children to control and so they can give their teeth a better clean. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It took a long time to get a better understanding of children’s needs around toothbrushes for a basic reason: the people who design oral-hygiene implements aren’t themselves children. There’s a gap between the typical experiences of the creator and the unexpressed needs of the customer. It wouldn’t help for the people designing the brushes to think more and more carefully about their own needs in this area. They had to shift the basis of their thinking and start imagining what it would be like to be<em> unlike</em> them. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They were starting to explore a key resource of business creativity: empathy. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">‘Creativity’ has become one of the most highly praised and prestigious concepts in modern business. Corporations are extremely keen to have a lot of it around and worry whenever it may be in decline. A large and lucrative market has emerged, feeding off some ill-focused insecurities. At worst, in a bid to increase creativity, senior executives might be sent to do some finger painting or else are let loose on a dressing-up box.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3324241858_7178e667f9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7044" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/3324241858_7178e667f9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3324241858_7178e667f9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p>But business creativity is a little different from artistic creativity. A company is a group of individuals gathered together to solve a problem for other people. This helps to define what the true focus of business creativity should be: intense and lateral thinking about what could be missing from the lives of customers. Business creativity means skill at identifying and profitably meeting the needs (many of them unspoken and vague) of customers. Everything else &#8211; the factories, the technology, the logistics, the spreadsheets &#8211; is in a sense secondary to this aim; whatever efforts are subsequently lavished on execution, a business cannot succeed if it hasn’t zeroed in on a real, that is, sufficiently urgent, human requirement.</p>
<p class="p1">Competition in capitalism is a constant struggle by companies to find more accurate accounts of the needs of their consumers. A good business is one that has understood needs better than its competitors. Therefore, the creativity that really counts &#8211; and that companies should attempt to foster &#8211; is the one that best helps a business enter the minds of its customers accurately and powerfully.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ON STANDING BACK</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stresses of running any business with even moderate success are pretty much all consuming. It’s no wonder, therefore, if enterprises sometimes lack the time to stand back and think creatively about innovation &#8211; and suffer accordingly down the line.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only a few companies can afford to send their teams to reflect on business in fancy lodges on the sides of mountains, but we can all get into the mindset such places are ideally meant to promote. We can get into the habit of mentally ‘standing back’ &#8211; and wondering whether the future of our business could be a bit different, and richer, than its past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are four big questions that can generate fruitful thinking:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image41.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7030" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image41.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image41" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four ‘Stand Back’ Questions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. What might your customer secretly be hoping for?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds odd but many customers privately (and unclearly) harbour hopes of companies that go a long way beyond what these companies are currently offering. A great way to innovate is to tap into these secret hopes and build products and services to meet them. The possibilities for growth can be enormous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take some of the hopes that hover around the travel industry. Consider the Four Seasons hotel on the Caribbean island of Nevis. What it offers its customers currently includes: a set of bungalows with plunge pools, a spa, tennis courts, a three star restaurant and water-skiing facilities. But it&#8217;s evident that these elements don&#8217;t represent the limit of the hopes that customers might be bringing to the hotel when they go there, the travellers might also be hoping that:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they can finally sort out anxieties around their careers</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- their relationships with their children could improve</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- they would reconnect with their partner</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image31.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7031" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image31.png?resize=635%2C336" alt="image31" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These three hopes are not currently addressed, but to take each of them seriously could mean setting up three new businesses (a professional development coach, a family therapist, marriage counselling).</span></p>
<p class="p1">Or let’s look at some of the secret hopes people bring to financial services companies. When we step back, a bank is not just a place to store money safely, with a competitive interest rate and decent customer service. We want these things, of course, but the less articulate secret hope is about something else: living well around money.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to money, we have questions about how to deal with envy, worries about what to spend money on, speculations about how to make money and desires for how to teach children about the value of money. There are big opportunities for the financial sector in understanding more correctly people’s biggest needs and ambitions around cash. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wide path to growth emerges whenever companies see themselves as being able to tackle not just a local issue but one of the big themes of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Are there neighbouring problems you could fix?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Does the problem that you’re fixing exist somewhere else and would it make sense for you to fix it there?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The designer Giorgio Armani founded his clothing business in 1975 and soon found widespread success. What motivated him was the desire to fix the chaos and clutter of the world &#8211; and he did this by giving his audience an experience of simple elegance delivered via clothes.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                     <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image15.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7032" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image15.png?resize=230%2C345" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But with time, Armani realised that similar problems &#8211; of clutter, chaos, mess, disorder &#8211; could be identified in other areas of life. He’d fixed it in one area, could he now move on to addressing it in others? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Armani company grew from clothes to perfumes to hotels and furniture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image30.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7037" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image30.png?resize=635%2C422" alt="image30" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"> Armani Hotel: Milan</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Might you take the same Message into a different Medium?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy for a company to become fixated on the medium in which it first launched &#8211; and therefore to fail to see that its message (which is the really valuable bit) could happily and lucratively transfer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This can happen to artists. Andy Warhol began his career making paintings. His values &#8211; an ironic, half-critical, half-loving look at the ephemera of American life &#8211; seemed ideally and perhaps exclusively suited to canvas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image29.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7038" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image29.png?resize=635%2C476" alt="image29" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But with time, Warhol stepped back and came to a richer realisation. His message could as happily exist in a book, a film, some photographs or a magazine. Which is how he came to make a two-minute film of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>himself eating a hamburger from Burger King.</span></p>
<p class="p1">

</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same manoeuvre can be made in business. For a long time, Michael Heseltine’s company, Haymarket Publishing, believed that it should exclusively focus on making magazines. But in the mid-1990s, Heseltine realised (these things always sound simple) that he had stuck a little too loyally to what was, after all, only the <em>medium</em> &#8211; and that his <em>message</em> (information relevant for businesses) could exist in many other media, an idea that lay behind a decision to start an event company, a digital platform and a consulting arm.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. What is the Bigger Version of your current activity?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of any current business activity we can ask ourselves: what is the bigger version of this? One can ask</span>: what is the underlying principle within the business? And what would it look like for the business to apply that principle in larger ways?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s take a very small thing indeed, a paperclip &#8211; and ask what the bigger version of this is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image07.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7039" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image07.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When teasing out the underlying principle of a business, we shouldn&#8217;t look at what the business actually does as the move it is making. So the principle of a nut manufacturer isn’t making nuts, it is making healthy snacks. The principle of a phone company isn’t making phones, it is communication. This means that one can imagine the business operating in ways that are utterly faithful to its principles and yet with quite different products and services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The underlying principle of the paperclip company is<strong> temporary order</strong>. The paperclip is a beautifully simple micro tool devoted to keeping sheaves of paper in order, while allowing them to be easily released. It was an advance on binding (which also orders papers but in a more permanent fashion, at odds with the need to extract particular sheets). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The larger version of this activity could lie in filing cabinets, shelving, bags and briefcases. Because in each case the same principle is involved. One day, the paperclip company could logically get around to car parks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image38.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7040" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image38.png?resize=451%2C451" alt="image38" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take a company that is currently making <strong>ear plugs</strong>. Its underlying principle is quiet. It’s tapping into the need for <strong>serenity</strong>: focus in a noisy world, where sound is a disturbing and intrusive factor. This could lead it into a range of new markets; noise-cancelling equipment, acoustic insulation or scented candles that promote tranquility. They might develop a brand of fee-paying luxury restrooms that are havens of quiet or reinvent the monastery as a quiet secular retreat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After some time in the metaphorical ski lodge, with some leaning back, we get….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Current-Activity.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7041" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Current-Activity.png?resize=619%2C288" alt="Current Activity" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Let’s consider some recent examples of companies that stepped back to find their macro position in the scheme of things, and that properly asked how they fitted into a good life.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1"> CASE STUDIES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LinkedIn</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When LinkedIn was launched in 2003, the founders and management understood the company as being in the CV exchange business. Professionals &#8211; including potential employers &#8211; could view each others resumes and develop online and real life connections. </span>However, recently, the company started to see itself from a far larger, less explored perspective. They realised that the huge underlying business opportunity was to try to match people’s true talents with the commercial needs of the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So LinkedIn redefined its mission as that of assisting everyone in getting the right, ideal job for them. To do this they would need consider a much broader range of issues, including: What are people&#8217;s real talents? How can people get to know them? How can talents be developed into skills? And how can proficiency in skills be demonstrated and proved to a global range of employers suspicious of the very variable and sometimes faulty markers of the current education system?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are much bigger challenges than making sure your CV gets to the right HR department. For instance, a person might be too distracted to explore their own minds. Or they might overestimate their abilities in a particular direction; or they might be lacking a convincing badge to prove what they can actually do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LinkedIn has finally broached what was always the big underlying &#8211; if tacit &#8211; longing of its users: that a company should be devoted to making sure they end up in the right job. A bigger</span> future for LinkedIn therefore involves expansion into a range of areas:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Therapeutic career assessment:</strong> a major problem around making the best use of one’s abilities is the difficulty in working out what kind of work one is suited to. This can be a life-long concern. We might easily be swayed by unhelpful expectations from others (a pushy family, a peer group that’s very competitive around status). Existing services in this area are expensive, unreliable and accessing them still feels like an unusual thing to do. The huge opportunity for LinkedIn is to deliver this universally and inexpensively through the user of artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Training materials:</strong> </span>The very recent $1.5 billion acquisition by LinkedIn of the education material supplier Lynda.com has been guided by the idea that in order to realise potential &#8211; and thus end up with the most satisfying work &#8211; people need to enhance their skills. It’s obviously not a new idea in itself. The education on offer, however (unlike what typically happens in schools and universities), is focused on helping people do their jobs better.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moves are an increasingly accurate assault on the fundamental problems the exchange of CVs was circling round: how to help people build good careers and how to help businesses build the workforces they ideally need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Airbnb</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was started in 2008, the founders of Airbnb originally conceived of their business as providing extra travel accommodation. </span>The company grew very quickly on a huge scale.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, though, Airbnb has reconsidered the business it is in, as a way of understanding how they can and should expand their operations. Conventional logic might have suggested they grow into an airline service (their customers do a lot of flying) or a bank (they are highly trusted around financial transactions). But instead they have structured their expansion plans around fulfilling some of the deeper hopes of travel. Not being able to find accommodation is one of the potential obstacles to happiness away from home. But there are lots of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14348806215_49c842bda3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7064" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/14348806215_49c842bda3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="14348806215_49c842bda3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get a handle on these, Airbnb has been studying what actually goes on when people travel. They have tracked individuals and families in detail, checking up on their heart rate, mood and anxiety levels. They&#8217;re discovering a lot of things that are going wrong with journeys:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Not really knowing where to go or why</em>: the modern world is hugely invested in the general idea of travel and has large &#8211; but vague &#8211; hopes for what travel could deliver. But the travel industry on the whole operates on the assumption that people already know what they are looking for, the task is only to get them them there. And yet we&#8217;re constantly ending up in places where we don&#8217;t entirely know what to do (and so end up going to the museum; a trip has arguably always gone wrong by the time we&#8217;ve ended up in the museum).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> To address this Airbnb is focusing on diagnostic help. Instead of asking ‘where do you want to go?’, they want to expand via the question: ‘what are you hoping to get from travel?’ They want to deliver a more psychotherapeutically informed travel-advisory service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Troubles of the self</em>: one can have a hideous row in the perfect bridal suite, feel anxious and lonely on a coral island, get bored in New York… The problem isn’t necessarily the place: there are petals on the bed, the white sand is perfect, the Frick Collection is around the corner. The problem is in us, we bring our distracted minds, our worries and frustrations with us. But up to now, the whole travel industry has been focused on only one half of the equation. In order to unlock the hopes of travel, Airbnb is now looking at:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Solving loneliness when travelling: by developing an introduction service, essentially making its platform social.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Using travel as a time to interact with other people in your line of work while on the move, to learn new things (a networking social version of LinkedIn).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– Romantic travel: helping couples to get on better</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7067" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="4102235118_0b1da8d8f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">These are radical innovations in the travel business. But they are not random. They are highly focused expansions that target the underlying hopes of travel, which Airbnb initially got involved in by addressing what turned out to be one small part of a vast issue.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
<p>The Green movement often attacks business for filling the world with junk. It tell us that we already have more than enough and therefore that the growth-focused agenda of business is evil. But the argument here is that business actually has to grow (and can grow in admirable directions) because companies are still so bad at fulfilling needs. There are still so many things that customers want and yet which aren’t being provided. These things are not trivial distractions or extravagant indulgences. They are central supports for the good, flourishing lives we rightly aspire to lead.</p>
<p class="p1">Innovation is the key because &#8211; in the sense we’ve been exploring &#8211; it is the process of working out business-solutions to problems that are most important to us. The products that any company is currently offering might only small part of the customer&#8217;s real needs in a given area. Creatively re-defining the business area that a company is in can radically alter the sense of what its core tasks might be &#8211; and where its future opportunities might lie.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Science fiction has, quite unfairly, developed rather a bad name for itself. It’s seen as a subgenre consumed primarily by young males and obsessed by the very worst, often goriest possibilities for the future. In fact, science fiction is a much underestimated tool in business. In its utopian, as opposed to dystopian, versions, it’s exploring what we might ideally want the future to be like &#8211; a little ahead of our practical abilities to mould it as we would wish.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/img1.mxstatic.com/wallpapers/3fe7394fd670b9b7311b5be52e2a8048_large.jpeg?resize=717%2C404" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Science fiction doesn’t of course contain the answers (how actually to make a jetpack or a robot that loves you). Rather, it encourages something that is logically prior to technological mastery: the identification of a particular need that one would badly want solved. The inventors of eighteenth-century England weren’t just technically more adept than the Ancient Romans (who had, after all, very successfully built aqueducts and concrete ceilings); because of certain socio-economic conditions (especially taboos around the use of slaves in the coal mines of the Midlands), the English entrepreneurial classes also wanted steam engines rather more urgently than their Roman predecessors ever had.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>20,000 Leagues under the Sea,</em> published in 1870, Jules Verne narrates the adventures of the Nautilus, a large submarine that tours the world’s oceans often at great depth (the 20,000 leagues &#8211; about 80,000 kilometres &#8211; refer to the distance travelled.) When writing the story, Verne didn’t worry too much about solving every technical issue involved with undersea exploration: he was just pinning down what it would be great one day to have. He describes the Nautilus as being equipped with a huge widow even though he had no idea how to make glass that could withstand pressure at great depth. He imagined the vessel having a machine that could make seawater potable, though the science behind desalination was extremely primitive at the time. And he described the Nautilus as powered by batteries &#8211; even though this technology was in its infancy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nemo_Aronax_viewbay_diver.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6998" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Nemo_Aronax_viewbay_diver.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="Nemo_Aronax_viewbay_diver" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Wouldn’t glass shatter at that pressure?’ Keeping such questions at bay for long enough to shape a vision.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jules Verne wasn’t an enemy of technology. He was deeply fascinated by practical problems. It’s just that in writing his novels, he held off from worrying too much about the ‘how’ questions. He brought the <em>idea</em> of the submarine into the minds of millions of people long before the technology that would allow the concept to take hold practically was in place. Eventually, of course we need to answer the ‘how’ questions. But science fiction reminds us that we can start elsewhere. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image13.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6999" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image13.png?resize=635%2C298" alt="image13" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We got there eventually.</h5>
<p class="p1">A central message of the science fiction genre is: for a time, don’t worry too much about <em><strong>how</strong></em> it’s all going to happen. Let&#8217;s just take the time to imagine the future first: people communicating telepathically, prospective partners chosen by brilliantly accurate computers, robots with deep emotional lives&#8230; The fact that we don’t at present know how to do any of these things shouldn’t hold us up. We need practice at concentrating on the way we want things to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dystopian sci-fi &#8211; the <em>Mad Max</em> scenario in which the future is imagined as being awful &#8211; isn’t where we need help. It’s only too easy to picture disaster. We’re almost always too preoccupied by anxieties around how anything could be achieved that we simply don’t get round to picturing what we’d actually like. So we need the sort of science fiction that encourages us to concentrate closely for a time on the positive developments we want to see happen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jules Verne is a constant inspiration in this area. In his 1865 novel, <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>, he expands on the thought of how great it would be to orbit and then land on the moon. He lets himself imagine this without getting embarrassed by the normally fatal objection that such an adventure was entirely beyond the reach of the available technology. He is addressing another part of the mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7000" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image05.png?resize=635%2C605" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We shouldn’t feel surprised that it all seems so real, though it was originally only imagined. It is real <em>because</em> it was first imagined.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his story, Verne imagines that the United States would launch a mission to the moon from a base in Florida. He fantasised that the craft would be made of the lightest metal he knew (aluminium) &#8211; which turned out to be right. He assigned what seemed an unspeakably vast price tag to the venture; the equivalent of more than the entire GDP of France at the time. And that, too, turned out to be a very respectable guess at how much the Apollo programme would cost. It was an amazingly prescient imaginative description. His vastly popular book didn’t help engineers, but it did something that in the long run was perhaps more significant. It brought forward the idea that it would be wonderful to do this kind of thing. It fostered the aspiration, which &#8211; in time &#8211; came to be (just) viable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image40.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7001" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image40.jpg?resize=635%2C643" alt="image40" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The projectile, as pictured in an engraving from the 1872 Illustrated Edition.</h5>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image24.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7002" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image24.jpg?resize=635%2C543" alt="image24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The recovery of the Apollo 13 Command Module.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inventions don’t actually start with discoveries of what it is technologically possible to do. They have a more extended history. They begin when people identify a longing &#8211; and to get to that longing, we may have to park practical considerations for long enough to imagine them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, the mobile phone made its debut in 1966, not in the labs of a tech company but on television screens, in the original series of <em>Star Trek</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7003" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C211" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The full range of uses of today’s phones wasn’t quite in focus. The film people didn’t think to get Captain Kirk to scroll down a twitter feed or swipe potential sex-partners on nearby planets.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image0311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7012" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image0311.jpg?resize=635%2C213" alt="image031" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But all the same, the core idea is brought powerfully to consciousness. One longs to have one of those too. In this sense, <em>Star Trek</em>  invented the wireless headset:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image32.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7005" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image32.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="image32" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the later incarnation of the series, <em>The Next Generation,</em> we encounter the origins of the iPad:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image171.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7007" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image171.jpg?resize=635%2C484" alt="image17" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mental move &#8211; ‘what would we want to happen one day?’ &#8211; has until now often focused on technology, but it doesn’t only have to operate here. The core concern is simply: where might our as-yet-unfulfilled needs take us? What would it be really nice to have? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such questions are capable of being levelled at a diverse range of human concerns. Take relationships. After two or three disastrous unions with people, primarily caused by weird kinks in their and our psychological histories, we might start to wonder how nice it would be if people had training in relationships that could be as rigorous as that currently given to commercial pilots. In the future, one might consider it bizarre ever to date anyone who hadn’t gone through at least 10,000 hours of classroom and practical training with the best minds in the field. Right now, there’s a modest industry of relationship counselling. It’s something a smallish fraction of people encounter and the results are often mixed. But, in an exercise comparable to Jules Verne’s moves, one could ask: what would it be like if a version of relationship counselling became one of the largest undertakings in society? It’s not such a mad thought experiment because relationship problems are truly amongst the most significant we ever face. The issues &#8211; of compromise, forgiveness, how to work out who might be right for one, how to cope with disappointment, how to help another person develop &#8211; could one day, perhaps, be handled by practiced, reliable instructors. We’d treat having relationships the way we treat getting a license to captain an A380: you’d need to demonstrate your abilities on a lesser scale first and you’d be tested in simulated practice around many component skills (resolving an argument, apologising, planning a family holiday &#8211; just as pilots now practice navigating over the Singapore Straits at night).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/109821067.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7155" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/109821067.jpg?resize=635%2C439" alt="An All Nippon Airways captain operates t" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Through such science fictional experiments, one gets into the habit of wondering how it would be if our world changed. These work to counteract our tendency to inhibit thinking around things that seem (at the moment) unlikely. And that’s extremely important, because when we look backwards we realise that, repeatedly, things that once seemed unlikely have come to play a huge role in our lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7009" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">We all have a science fiction side to our brains, which we are generally not used to giving free reign to. But creating the dream allows the space in which later patient development can happen. It gives us permission to wonder. It helps us to know what we’d really like to be true, and thereby gives us the energy to help one day make it so.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Offices exist to help people collaborate. But lots goes wrong in the attempt. Some of the hurdles are procedural: meetings go on too long, everyone talks at the same time, the agenda isn’t right, there aren’t enough whiteboards, or the windows or breakout spaces are meanly proportioned. But many more of the problems are psychological in nature. People aren’t collaborating well because there’s too much defensiveness, irrational rivalry, people-pleasing, negativity, bluster, over-controlling behaviour, secret manoeuvring, unfriendliness or not-listening.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trying to overcome these hurdles is at one level a matter for every individual. But there are also office-wide solutions that companies can introduce to hugely improve the atmosphere among co-workers. We can address <em>personal</em> issues in a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>political</em>, that is, collective and institutional, way. Issues that feel like they are intimate and purely personal &#8211; like being too bossy or a poor listener &#8211; can be usefully and constructively addressed at the level of an organisation’s habits and practices. An ambitious organisation can help people to do nothing less than mature. It can put in place practices that help individuals to recognise and deal with their emotional flaws (which, of course, everyone has in some way or another). That is a great contribution to the development of each person, but it is also precisely focused on improving how efficiently and effectively people work together.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2276392858_77099a3abb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6902" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2276392858_77099a3abb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2276392858_77099a3abb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, the idea of IQ &#8211; intelligence quotient &#8211; had currency in evaluating people. It sought to assess the level of a person’s logical and reasoning abilities. And to some degree this was correlated with ‘employability’. The idea was that people in the upper percentiles would do better at work. However, close up, we can now see that whatever a person’s raw intellectual ability, their actual contribution at work is going to be hugely dependent on their degree of emotional maturity: their EQ.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">IQ is understood as something that doesn’t change all that much across a life. EQ, on the contrary, can change dramatically. It’s built into the whole idea of maturity that we’re capable of acquiring it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- though we tend to do so in unreliable and uneven ways. In the workplace, we can improve the level of emotional maturity that we all attain. An organisation committed to raising EQ sets out to help people develop emotionally, by examining and resolving areas of immaturity and failures of collaboration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few steps to take on the path to a more mature and collaborative workspace:</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Collaboration is hard; we’re all crazy</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6488" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="7023561195_dfdfffcb66_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">© Flickr/John Benson</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the great enemies of good collaboration is the sense that collaboration should essentially be easy, and that people are generally straightforward. A more helpful starting point is that collaborating is always hard and that all of us are a little crazy. There is no such thing as a wholly sane person and by the time you have 20 people in a room, the challenging psychodynamics are of mind-boggling complexity. Recognising this should lead to humility and a greater readiness to tread carefully, to apologise, to give way and &#8211; where necessary &#8211; to laugh warmly and generously at our foibles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a good collaborative office, there should be an attitude of honesty towards the challenges of working together. Getting frustrated with someone, starting to cry, falling into despair &#8211; these aren’t anomalies, they are what happens in any good life, when clever people get together and try to do difficult things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’d be a company-wide atmosphere of tolerance towards the quirks and eccentricities of human nature. The company would revere not just the strengths of great people; it would also honour and remember their weaknesses: Coco Chanel’s secrecy, Eisenhower’s inability to listen, Napoleon’s dogmatism, Henry James’s tardiness, Van Gogh’s scattiness…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6489" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/640px-Coco_Chanel_1920.jpg?resize=635%2C462" alt="640px-Coco_Chanel,_1920" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Time/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good collaborative office would know that the real problem isn’t having problems &#8211; it’s the attitudes of denial and the failure to be able to feed back on, and work through, issues that causes trouble. We don&#8217;t need people to be perfect: but we absolutely need them to want to recognise their flaws and to try to improve on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Campfire Meetings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once the campfire is lit, the tension goes down; it’s the end of the day, the pressure is off a little. It’s the time to be honest and to share how things really are. In an EQ committed organisation, there are regular campfire meetings, usually on a Friday at 5pm. For an hour, everyone gathers, in groups of no more than twenty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A central purpose of the meetings is to develop a culture where it’s normal to confess to problems around working together and collaborating. There’s no stigma around having these problems, since it’s assumed from the start that everyone has difficulties of one kind or another. The issue isn’t whether there are psychological flaws: it’s a question of working out which ones and how they are interacting with those of others. The benign group pressure makes it much easier to admit to a failing.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stigma does, however, remain but in a different area. The topic for discussion is often: ‘What unhealthy dynamics do I feel in myself and how might I improve?’ It’s socially unacceptable not to have anything to say around this, not to try to do anything to improve or deal with issues. It’s normal to be crazy and it’s normal and indispensable to be committed to maturity. Confession isn’t an excuse. It’s tied to development. The EQ office is a Continuously Maturing Office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The meeting runs through points in the recent past where people lacked EQ. And there’s discussion of where individuals might develop specific skills or make use of particular insights.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The meetings enforce a feeling of normality around maturation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">An EQ Environment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Emotional development, and dealing reasonably with the difficult emotional circumstances that work inevitably throws up, isn’t just about special occasions or one-off moments of revelation. Our minds are leaky: we are continually forgetting things that &#8211; at our best moments &#8211; we know are important. We require regular topping up, a little nudge here and there to keep us on track. We’re not committed to bad habits, we just need reminders of the good ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So a good HR department sees it as its responsibility to foster a good EQ environment. It might send around emails about some of the main EQ difficulties which help us recognise them in ourselves and give encouragement in addressing them with others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it isn’t enough just to write essays or give lectures. The way something is said &#8211; the form the crucial reminders are delivered in &#8211; has to be sufficiently seductive to overcome resistance, compete for attention with a thousand emails and lodge themselves in our memories powerfully. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good EQ office might send around this sort of email, among many others:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Direct Chat</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An EQ office has a culture of direct chats. It formalises these, so as to put them more forcibly on the agenda. It calls them <em>Direct Chats</em> or DCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great deal of trouble within teams, the lion’s share, comes from people not speaking honestly about their hopes, disappointments and frustrations. Things are bottled up, and then explode or seep noxiously through an office.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are good reasons why most of us are so indirect in our modes of communication. Politically, it’s only been a few generations since we’ve enjoyed freedom and the ability to speak as we like. Inside though, we retain an inner serfdom. Moreover, many of our childhoods didn’t promote direct communication. We were small, vulnerable infants in the hands of large, powerful adults and we may not have dared, or known how, to speak up and clearly about our needs. Indirectness is a strategy in conditions of unequal power.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/15946263618_7ffb413b44_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6491" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/15946263618_7ffb413b44_z.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="15946263618_7ffb413b44_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Lotus Carroll</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most offices are filled with power inequalities which work against any capacity to communicate directly: What if I speak and they fire me? What if I speak and they resign? What if I speak, and they don’t buy? It can seem as if there are ample reasons always to lapse back into habits of indirectness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the EQ-committed office doesn’t accept this, it knows &#8211; perhaps from experience &#8211; how expensive indirectness always ends up being, and how much wisdom and good practice come to the fore when people dare to be direct.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it accords huge privilege to the practice of The Direct Chat. Any employee can at any point put in a request for A Direct Chat with any other, right across company hierarchies: the receptionist can request a DC with the boss, the middle manager in sales or the IT guy on the floor below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are strict rules around how a DC can go. Company videos show workers the format of a DC. There are three training sessions around this for every new employee. Crucially, there are responsibilities on both sides of the equation, the speaker and the listener. For example, the speaker can never directly accuse the listener. They cannot say, ‘You never listen to me in meetings.’ They have to say, ‘<em>You make me feel as if </em>you are not listening to me in meetings&#8230;’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3385144016_bffece6c44_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6495" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3385144016_bffece6c44_b.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3385144016_bffece6c44_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/smannion</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This avoids the suggestion that the speaker has deliberately meant to upset the listener. It leaves room for misunderstanding and for the idea that the speaker might be transfering an emotion from elsewhere. The tone cannot be accusatory. One can show upset, but no desire for vengeance; one can be sad but not furious. One cannot broaden the complaint exponentially (one cannot, as marriage counsellors say, ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the other).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the while, the listener has responsibilities. They cannot humiliate, they cannot deny that there is an issue, they have to accept the courage and authenticity behind the complaint. They have to listen patiently and never laugh cruelly. The other is taking a risk, like taking off their clothes, and one has to admire the courage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within a DC, all kinds of slightly unusual behaviour are entirely permitted. You can cry, you can be intense, emotion is allowed. This doesn’t get used against you. Most importantly, one moves on: one isn’t allowed to hold grudges from past DCs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having DCs should be seen as a normal part of office life. If one doesn’t have at least five a year, something is very wrong and it counts against one. The culture of DCs signals that the office has left behind the age of feudalism and psychological humiliation; indirectness is not only emotionally unhelpful, it is far far too expensive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">EQ Reviews</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re all in possession of insights into the flaws of others, which are true and potentially very useful. You’ve noticed time and again how a particular colleague tries to press too much work onto others; it’s struck you that one of the people you collaborate with on a major project is so eager to please that you’re finding yourself discounting whatever they say. These people don’t set out to create problems around collaboration and in an ideal world these insights could get passed along to the relevant people in an unthreatening and useful way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3306671894_73998a6466_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3306671894_73998a6466_z.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="3306671894_73998a6466_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/bareknuckleyellow</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we almost never do share these with the person concerned. Because at the moment, there’s a real fear the person would take it the wrong way &#8211; as a cruel attack, rather than as an attempt to help. It would seem to leave one open to a reciprocal attack &#8211; which, again, feels too threatening. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Really, the only place where we buck this trend is in relationships; the rest of the time we are basically avoidant; we give up on people, suffer in silence or change jobs. This inefficiency costs everyone a lot. It’s a situation where a great deal of important information is in the ether, but it can’t be tapped into effectively because we lack the skill to do so. Not a technical skill. But the emotional skill of framing an issue in a way that doesn’t humiliate someone and that doesn’t make us come across as vindictive or mean.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office can be the arena in which this omnipresent issue is addressed and solved &#8211; by developing the EQ Review. Everyone in the company needs to see an EQ Coach at least once a year. Management gives the EQ Coach a number of guidelines on how a particular individual is falling short in the ten areas of EQ immaturity. In more pressing cases (where someone is falling short in their work schedule or causing problems for other people) substantial EQ treatment can be delivered: each immaturity takes at least four one-hour sessions to treat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because there can be feedback from employee to employer in the course of the EQ Review the relationship between the coach and the company is &#8211; potentially &#8211; extremely valuable. It allows for the development of a deep understanding of what is going well &#8211; or not too well &#8211; in the relationship between management and employees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It’s a field in which it is crucial &#8211; but extremely difficult &#8211; to get insight. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/175019386.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6905" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/175019386.jpg?resize=635%2C393" alt="US-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PEACE-DIPLOMACY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Diplomacy arises when there’s too much tension between two parties for them to engage openly themselves. They get too upset or intimidated. And yet, there is a huge amount they could constructively share. The coach is a kind of diplomat &#8211; a go-between &#8211; and is the skilful and professional ambassador of vitally important knowledge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For too long, sorting out psychological issues has been seen as a luxury, as something beneficial only to personal life. But this is an illusion we can no longer afford. Emotional maturity is no add-on to an effective business, it has to be at its core, it is quite simply the most valuable skill for any team of people as they pursue the big collective tasks of modern business.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Collaborating with other people is hard. Few of us are born knowing how to do it. Odd though it might sound, we have to learn, by conscious reflection, how to work successfully with others. And so we should take care to identify and occasionally nurture what one might term ‘the collaborative virtues’, the set of psychological traits on which good teamwork depends.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Modesty about Sanity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s desperately easy to settle into the view that it’s always other people’s fault: they are the peculiar, stupid, mean, lazy, judgemental ones. That may well be true, but it doesn’t make progress any easier. We need to start from a different, less self-righteous place. We need to keep clear in our minds all the very many shameful times when we have messed up, lost our tempers, failed to interpret situations correctly and acted vindictively and blindly. We should take on board with good grace the truth that we too are blockheads. Self-righteousness is the enemy of group work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of loosening our grip on self-righteousness means identifying one’s transferences: all the distinctive psychological patterns generated in childhood that one is bringing to situations in the present. We should strive to overcome our flaws through a patient, sympathetic understanding of our psychological histories and the warps they have created in our minds. Self-analysis is &#8211; in this context &#8211; not self-indulgent, it’s a social virtue. We will become much easier people to be around once we good-naturedly accept that we are all genuinely very difficult &#8211; and, in no pejorative sense, a little crazy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6907" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3809700156_cbe7d82ed9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Others are Scared, Not Mean or Stupid</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When there is conflict, it’s painfully easy to run to the interpretation that those who are giving us trouble are nasty or bad. That isn’t a cheering realisation but it’s an oddly satisfying one nevertheless: it somehow settles our disappointments into safely depressive patterns and confirms an underlying suspicion that the world is peopled by idiots, an imputation for which there is always plenty of evidence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the truth is more complicated. Other people are rarely simply bad. What they are far more often is scared. They are behaving in desperately unhelpful ways because they are extremely anxious on some score. Though the raised voices and defensive tone look like signs of strength, no one </span>who is feeling strong ever actually behaves like this. The mature response should hence not be to increase the tension and flare up in return, but to strive to see that one has a hurt, flailing, lost person in front of one, to whom the correct response should be sympathy, calm and understanding. Let’s not always be so shallow as to get put off by the dispiriting externals. Let’s do our colleagues the honour of looking beyond the troublesome surface behaviour, to the frightened person within. It’s an art that every parent knows how to practice with a child in a tantrum and it is no insult to any adult to be treated, occasionally, as if they too were still somewhere inside them very young and deserving of the sympathy we naturally give to children. That’s what tolerance and love really mean &#8211; looking beyond the adult bluster to the fearful child within.</p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"> Strive to be as patient as you would naturally be with him</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. The Art of Directness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both at a psychological and at a political level, we have backgrounds that have emphasised the art of indirectness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Only a few generations back, almost all of us lived under deeply authoritarian regimes, where the priorities were keeping quiet and practicing subterfuge. Not speaking directly was a survival mechanism. You wouldn’t tell the king how you really felt: your insights were of no interest to the feudal lord. You learnt to keep very quiet around your tyrannical boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6454" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image04.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not an understanding ear: King Louis XIV of France</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, at the psychological level, every childhood is marked by vast differences in status between child and adult which often train us to hide what we experience. We start off as helpless infants exposed to the momentous power of adults. It isn’t easy to find one’s voice with someone who has a 30-year head start, apparently knows everything, controls the TV and computer and has a very strict view of who we are meant to be. The adults are meant to have our best interests at heart, but they may not always provide conditions in which we can freely express our needs without fear of retribution: they do not always offer lessons in the art of directness. Perhaps our caregivers needed us to be preternaturally ‘good’ or were excessively worried by signs of independence. It’s still remarkably rare to grow up in families where saying what you feel is seen as a virtue, rather than a troublesome trait best stamped out with discipline.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so we become experts in bottling up, in working around people, in not saying what we feel and what is ailing us; or in exploding in rage or settling into sulks rather than confidently letting out our issues in a deliberate, slow, convincing, mature way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our silences and defences come not from evil, but from a sense that our voice is illegitimate, because we are &#8211; somewhere inside &#8211; still serfs or infants. The enemy of good collaboration is an ingrained low self-esteem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To mature, we need to develop an adequate sense of self-love and resilience: we must feel that we have a right to exist, to be heard and to speak &#8211; and that we are strong enough to deal with what might happen if we were honest. We need a sense that we can survive the annoyance of another person. Indirectness is no sin, it’s a natural result of having been forced into patterns of subterfuge through early vulnerability. But we are now adults, people who can survive blows or move on if they prove intolerable. We are no longer cowed five-year-olds, desperate lest an adult withdraw their support. We have options. We can work on improving our impression of our own survivability. We can endure the risk of being disliked &#8211; in the name of a cleansing confrontation. We should go through mental exercises to practice inner resilience:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; I may be sacked, but I will find another job.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; They may not like me here, but there will be other places which will respond more favourably.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; What I feel is not always bad or strange: it can deserve to be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to tell ourselves helpful, important things that we failed to hear from others sufficiently loudly early on:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; You’re going to be OK, whatever happens next.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> &#8211; I will love you even if…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Enough of stalking the earth with our shoulders hunched and our eyes wary. We have nothing to be ashamed of. We must channel a voice of confidence at moments when it will be submerged, through tiredness and fear, by the voices of the past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. The Weaknesses of Strengths</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other people are often so disappointing, it’s easy to lock on to their faults and simply wonder again and again why they are the way they are. Why are they so slow? Why are they so unreliable? How can they be so bad at confrontation? Why can’t they break bad news? Why are they so shifty? Do they have to be so defensive?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Circling the faults like this has a superficial self-righteous appeal, but it doesn’t begin to address the real issue. There is one giant alternative, a theory we call the Weaknesses of Strengths (WoS for short).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3199748827_9fe4204260_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6478" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3199748827_9fe4204260_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3199748827_9fe4204260_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Ludovic Bertron</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The theory goes like this: every strength that an individual has necessarily brings with it a weakness of which it is an inherent part. It is impossible to have strengths without weaknesses. Though our minds tend to hive off the strengths and see these as essential, while deeming the weaknesses as a freakish add-on, in truth, the weaknesses are part and parcel of the strengths. We have the wrong picture of what a virtue is; there is no such thing in isolation, it will always be a virtue-vice. So the virtue of thoroughness is always going to bring with, in other contexts, the problem of pedantry; creative brilliance is going to be inseparable from logistical unreliability; people who are fantastic leaders at work are likely to be seriously difficult around domestic chores.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason for keeping this in mind is that we often encounter people&#8217;s weaknesses at moments when we’re in danger of losing sight of their strengths. At certain points, all it seems we’re bumping into are the weaknesses. We wonder: how did I end up in this relationship, hiring this person, joining this group of colleagues? During tough times, we remember only the flaws. We irritably notice just the pedantic way X chews their food, or Y’s maddening habit of announcing a grand scheme then never following up on it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are failing to step back enough and ask the really vital question: not just what are these people’s weaknesses, but what are the strengths of which these pretty annoying traits are the unfortunate shadow sides?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should remember that there are no ideal candidates out there &#8211; and may hence be a little more cautious about walking out on a relationship or calling an end to an employment contract. We may well find people with different strengths, but they will also have a new litany of weaknesses to introduce us to in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to overcome an unhelpful belief in a theoretical unity of virtues, in the possibility that anyone could be at once loyal and edgy, thorough and fizzing with creative energy; authoritative and pliant. All the virtues cannot coexist &#8211; every virtue has a weakness that will negate or contradict other virtues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is, incidentally, why people need teams: of 2 or 5 or 100. We need teams because all the virtues don’t coexist and need to be counterbalanced. A team is a union of strengths and a compensation for individual weaknesses. If one could possess all the virtues, there’d simply be no reason ever to live with someone else or join an office. The necessary price for our reliance on strengths is having to endure certain weaknesses too. We haven’t been uniquely cursed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 1870s, when he was living in Paris, the American novelist Henry James became a good friend of the celebrated Russian novelist Ivan Turgenev, who was also living in the city at that time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image07.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6455" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image07.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ivan Turgenev: great at writing, appalling at punctuality.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Henry James was particularly taken by the unhurried, tranquil style of the Russian’s storytelling. He obviously took a long time over every sentence, weighing different options, changing, polishing, until &#8211; at last &#8211; everything was perfect. It was an ambitious, inspiring approach to writing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in personal and social life these same virtues could make Turgenev a maddening companion. He’d accept an invitation to lunch; then &#8211; the day before &#8211; send a note explaining that he would not be able to attend; then another saying how much he looked forward to the occasion. Then he would turn up &#8211; two hours late. Arranging anything with him was a nightmare. Yet his social waywardness was really just the same thing that made him so attractive as a writer. It was the same unwillingness to hurry; the same desire to keep the options open until the last moment. This produced marvellous books &#8211; <strong><em>and</em></strong> dinner party chaos. In reflecting on Turgenev’s character, Henry James reflected that his Russian friend was exhibiting the ‘weakness of his strength.’</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we’re collaborating we’re often exposed to the downside of people’s positive capacities. Every virtue has an associated weakness. The person who is extremely methodical and can be relied upon to spot tiny (but highly consequential) errors early on is invaluable. They can go through a document with a toothcomb. But maybe to be like that they also have to have a certain dimming of the imagination, a tendency to be less adventurous in conversation and see life mainly in quantitative terms. They might not be your ideal companion on holiday or the person you’d turn to to unburden your troubled soul. But that’s bearable when these are seen as consistent with their valuable strengths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not all the virtues can belong together in a single person. The person who is really adventurous around ideas, who doesn’t get intimidated by the power of ‘how we’ve always done things’ &#8211; is very unlikely to also be able to have the virtues of modesty and calm. They are quite likely to get carried away at times. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should be ready for this &#8211; and never lose sight of a strength, at moments when the weakness is only too painfully apparent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gratitude</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collaboration should be founded on recognition that there are bigger tasks we believe in but cannot accomplish on our own. And not merely in the sense that we don’t have enough time to do it all ourselves. But more profoundly in the sense that we ourselves lack some of the necessary aptitudes and skills for an important project. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a natural temptation of the soloist: we may assume that the most prominent skill is the only one that really counts &#8211; and so not much appreciate the less conspicuous contributions of other people &#8211; although those background contributions really are necessary, and without them the star efforts would be much less effective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gratitude develops in tandem with humility. If you’re ready to admit that you can’t do something well enough (though it does need to be done) then you are developing an appreciation of people who have the relevant ability, even if it is in a less prestigious area than your own. Instead of just envying them &#8211; and quietly wishing they would go away or make some big mistake &#8211; one is relieved that someone has the needed skill. This kind of gratitude means you don’t necessarily have to like a person to be glad to be working with them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13855993803_59df86b02a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6909" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/13855993803_59df86b02a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="13855993803_59df86b02a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gratitude involves acknowledging dependence: it means recognising that one really needs the contributions of others. And it can be genuinely frightening to admit that a crucial outcome (which is very important to one’s own ambitions) is significantly in the hands of colleagues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>So, the successful collaborator is someone who is able to live with the anxiety of dependence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A basic reason one gives up on collaboration (or goes through the motions, with limited enthusiasm) is a lack of faith in education, a lack of sincere belief that people can change. You look at your colleagues &#8211; at the people you are going to be collaborating with &#8211; and just know all the difficulties. That one is so slow, the other one is so narcissistic, a third is so cautious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The good collaborator isn’t always too worried about this, because they have a theory of change. The fact that their colleagues don’t understand something or have settled into some unfortunate ways doesn’t seem to them like a disaster. The good collaborator has a measure of reasonable faith that better practices and ideas can be made convincing, if introduced with tack and energy. They have faith in the general human capacity to learn (which everyone has exercised to a very great extent at many points in their lives, even if they’ve given up on it at the moment). They are not particularly daunted by the ignorance of others, nor indeed are they dismayed by their own current inabilities. They are believers in education.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Strategic Pessimism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strategic pessimism is different from despair. It’s a limited, conscious attempt to reign in expectations when these are causing particular difficulties. In reality, we will have to spend time alongside and engaged with people who we find problematic and yet cannot, for a range of reasons, confront honestly and attempt to resolve differences with. Our options can feel desperately limited. We can’t get rid of them, we can’t make them different and we don’t want to just walk out the door ourselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So all that’s left is learning how to live &#8211; and interact and collaborate &#8211; with people who we don’t intuitively like or who have some marked problems with. Living in a dignified way with things we don’t like but can’t change was one of the central challenges that a group of ancient philosophers &#8211; named the Stoics &#8211; devoted their lives to exploring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Stoicism was a philosophy that flourished for some 400 years in Ancient Greece and Rome, gaining widespread support among all classes of society. It had one overwhelming and highly practical ambition: teaching people how to endure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We still honour this school whenever we call someone ‘stoic’ or plain ‘philosophical’ when fate turns against them: when they lose their keys, are humiliated at work, rejected in love or disgraced in society. Of all philosophies, Stoicism remains perhaps the most immediately relevant and useful for moments of office life.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman Stoic Seneca: the patron saint of challenging meetings.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Contrary to an optimistic mindset that thinks every problem can (with sufficient ingenuity and effort) be put right, the Stoics embraced the idea that there are numerous problems we can’t solve but can nevertheless accommodate ourselves to with grace. They took the view that if we try to solve them, and keep on stoking our hopes that they will get solved and put right, we make ourselves very miserable, because we’re always feeling immensely frustrated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoics were deeply moved by contemplation of what for them was an everyday sight &#8211; a dog being yanked along behind a cart at the end of a rope. The dog is going to have to follow the cart of course: there’s nothing it can do about that; but all the time it fights against the inevitable; it strains and gets agitated and tries to rush off to either side or hold back. It’s an image of immense, but futile, agitation. And it reminded the Stoics of … human beings. From the dog example, they drew an important moral. When the dog gives up trying to follow its own path and simply trots behind the cart, it is much less pained. A key Stoic idea is that we need to make a similar kind of move to live more comfortably with problems that we can’t change in our own lives: we must trot along obediently behind the cart of our difficult colleagues. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Stoic move is to assume from the start that it is normal and natural for things to go quite badly sometimes. Of course, other people generally are very annoying in some ways. Obviously, collaboration is going to be quite hard. It’s normal to find working with others very difficult. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By presenting problems of collaboration as standard some of the heat is taken out of the situation. We no longer feel that we’re uniquely cursed with insufferable colleagues; we get a little less drawn to the fantasy of how great things might be if only we worked somewhere else.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Forgiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It may not be a term we’re especially used to deploying in the work place. But it signals a crucial shift in attitude.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Typically, we are acutely aware of other peoples’ symptoms and are drawn to demonising. We think of the bothersome individual as<em> deliberately</em> being like that, as having on purpose made themselves as they are. We don’t just find them annoying, we blame them. It stokes our resentment. we imagine that at every moment of their existence they have opted to have been self-aggrandising, or lazy, or unwilling to take any responsibility when things go wrong. It’s a way of thinking about them that hardens our resentment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forgiveness is tied up with the thought that <em>it’s possible for any decent person to end up in a very unfortunate place</em>. It encourages explanations of how a person who is otherwise quite sensitive, and normally well-intentioned, honourable and decent can end up being defensive, grumpy or sly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We realise that people come to be this way not because they got a strange positive desire to be like that, but because quite bad and difficult things have happened to them, and in response (as a way of surviving) they’ve developed a set of unattractive characteristics.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Emma Bovary: How good people can end up doing bad things.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 19th century France, the idea of a married woman having an affair was regarded &#8211; officially and in respectable circles at least &#8211; with horror. A fallen woman had no right to sympathy; she must be without any decent feelings. In <em>Madame Bovary</em>, the great-hearted novelist Gustave Flaubert tells the story of how an intelligent, imaginative and serious woman could end up married to one man and in bed with another. He redirects the reader’s response. Emma Bovary is no longer someone to be condemned and treated as an outcast. Flaubert doesn’t pretend that her affair is fine (the novel has a bleak ending). But he does transform the idea of the kind of woman who might end up in this situation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling that one is oneself troubled or defective in some ways &#8211; even if not the <em>same</em> ways as the people who annoy you &#8211; is a crucial move towards a measure of forgiveness. It points up the general thought: it’s not just this person. They may be unlike us in the particular way in which they are irritating and difficult &#8211; but not in the simple fact of being difficult and irritating: that’s common ground &#8211; if only we can bring ourselves to admit it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The key question is to ask: ‘despite the surface differences, have I ever done anything similar&#8230;’: have I ever wished another person to fail, out of spite? Have I ever felt that a task was beneath my dignity? Have I ever wished I could go behind people’s backs and not have to bother with persuading them?’ The point of a forgiving attitude isn’t to say that this kind of conduct is just fine and doesn’t matter. We know it matters. What it does is adjust our view of the person who is misbehaving. It turns them from a demon into someone quite normal, someone a bit like us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Acceptable Tensions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we are trying to picture the kind of office where there’s lots of fruitful collaboration going on, we might imagine everyone getting on well; meetings with lots of agreement and shared insights. We tend to associate collaboration with harmony. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s another possibility &#8211; one that was most notably explored by the German philosopher Hegel. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6459" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image21.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="image21" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Hegel’s famous book, <em>The Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, he traces the way that the views of ambitious and intelligent people have changed over time. At one point, the most sophisticated and serious people thought that it was extremely important to be devoted to your family and your group. They saw loyalty as one of the most important of human qualities. Then opinion shifted. People came to distrust groups, the idea was that it was most important to be an individual, to find your own voice and develop your own unique point of view. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These outlooks are pretty much diametrically opposed. And Hegel was reluctant to say that one was obviously better than the other. Rather, he suggested they are both ‘true’ &#8211; that is each hits upon something important. So, ideally we’d be able to extract the bit of the truth that each side possesses and find a way of holding them together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hegel believed that the way in which this happens &#8211; in which separated bits of insight get joined together &#8211; is not especially peaceful. It’s the good result of conflict. When people conflict well they bring their deepest, most important insights to the surface; by having to defend them against intelligent criticism they find better, more powerful ways of expressing their ideas. Hegel encourages us not to get too alarmed by the clash of ideas. The ideal collaboration &#8211; in his view &#8211; involves tension, profound disagreements and conflicts in outlook and ambition. Hegel gave good conflict a special name: he called it a ‘dialectic’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspired by Hegel, the<em> dialectical</em> office might incubate divergent micro-cultures. There would be an expectation of squabbling, of opposition and disagreement &#8211; in the conviction that, ideally, it is from such tensions that the really valuable insights do finally emerge. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">&#8216;Good Enough’ Company</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because commerce really is competitive, and because mistakes are at times harshly punished by the market, work can easily tap into our latent fear of imperfection. We come to feel that we have to get everything right, that any mistake is going to lead to disaster. It’s a feeling that intensifies the anxieties around collaboration. One’s mediocre, awkward or difficult colleagues are surely going to bring the whole business down. The feeling grows that it’s necessary to battle them every day. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, however, that many imperfect things survive and even flourish in the world. A remarkable number of things can go wrong, and do go wrong, and things muddle along anyhow. The individual and a nation can survive an awful lot of mistakes, perhaps as many as 40% of decisions can go very wrong, and still we’ll get through. There is a number above which things get genuinely dangerous, but it’s perhaps a lot lot higher than we might assume in our more panic stricken moments &#8211; as we contemplate the idiocies of politicians or our colleagues. This is what it means to have a resilient attitude: it’s a knowledge that the ship can have a lot of leaks in it and still stay afloat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald Winnicott (1896-1971) was an English paediatrician, who early on in his career became passionate about the then new field of psychoanalysis. He was analysed by James Strachey, who had translated Freud into English, and became Britain’s first medically-trained child psychoanalyst. He worked as a consultant in children’s medicine at the Paddington Green Children’s Hospital in London, and also played a crucial role in public education around child-rearing, delivering some 600 talks on the BBC, tirelessly lecturing around the country and authoring 15 books, among which the bestselling <em>Home is Where We Start From</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image15.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6460" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image15.jpg?resize=635%2C403" alt="image15" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Winnicott wanted to help people to be, in his famous formulation, ‘good enough’ parents; not brilliant or perfect ones (as ambitious people naturally might have wished), but just OK. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was aware that new parents are often very panicked by the slightest mistake. They worry to an extraordinary degree if they miss a feed, or if the child isn’t reading exactly when the books say they should be or if there are quite a lot of tantrums. His tone is always reassuring. He tells his audiences that no one is perfect, all one needs to aim for is to be ‘good enough’, that every child’s upbringing has enormous tensions in it, that a bit of madness belongs to sanity, that feeling lost is a part of finding one’s way &#8211; and a dozen more lessons of comparable simplicity and down-beat essential wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6911" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="5912949405_0f1f8449cb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Matteo Bagnoli</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The move Winnicott made around parenting wasn’t designed to let sloppy, negligent, indifferent people feel great about themselves. Winnicott was trying to help the normal kind of person who is already quite conscientious and committed but who is in danger of getting very frustrated with themselves and others because they think it’s absolutely essentially to get everything right. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such worries don’t only exist around the nursery. At work too, we may get so taken up with our ideals that we grow unnecessarily angry and panicked around our colleagues and the normal wear and tear of office life. It is completely normal to want everything to be perfect. But the only long-term solution is to reconcile oneself to the omnipresence of error &#8211; and to settle instead on the workable ideal of belonging to a ‘good enough company.’</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Although collaboration – the extraordinary business of having to work with other people – is one of the major facts of modern life, it remains strangely unstudied and undiscussed as a formal topic. Our culture does not typically invite us to pay close and admiring attention to successful collaborative efforts, nor to immerse ourselves in learning the lessons from painful, failed joint ventures.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are – without being much aware of it – guided by a strong Romantic prejudice in favour of lone creators. This is where we focus our attention and derive our models of work from. The largest stories we tell ourselves about creating things concern artists, isolated actors who operate without relying on anyone other than themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6405" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr.jpeg?resize=635%2C598" alt="Van_Gogh_-_Selbstbildnis_mit_verbundenem_Ohr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One person painted this canvas yet and there are – at this moment – 4,876 books about the man. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re much less familiar, and much less culturally appreciative, of the kind of labours that went into creating things like the Jean-Luc Lagardère assembly plant at Toulouse-Blagnac in south-western France, where the Airbus 380 is put together. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/L-Bob-150.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6406" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/L-Bob-150.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="L-Bob (150)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">8,000 people were involved in making the hangar and assembly line, but we generally don’t know anything at all about their lives or labours. We don’t have burned into our imaginations stirring tales of the key meetings at which a group of senior executives took the major decision to focus final production in Toulouse rather than Hamburg or Filton; nor of the late night meetings at which specialists in wing design got together with the people who were in charge of the landing gear to make sure that their scheduling needs would be catered for within the new facility. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet this neglect of collaboration is no inconsequential matter. Some failures around collaboration are due to <em><strong>procedural and practical problems</strong></em>. For example: meetings are scheduled at inconvenient times, the layout of a room doesn’t facilitate interaction, the management architecture of a corporation means that people in different departments find it really hard to understand one another; the email system doesn’t allow for group discussions&#8230; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At The School of Life [the parent company of The Book of Life], our focus is slightly different. We’re interested in the <strong><em>psychological problems</em></strong> that get in the way of good collaboration. Our goal is to understand how organisations trip up even when the technology is in place, the architecture is pleasing and the staff have all the right qualifications on paper – because everyone is bringing what might be called ‘problems of character’ into the office with them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The root cause of a lot of difficulties in collaboration is nothing less than emotional. Emotional issues are not an incidental aspect of modern business; they are not a vague phenomenon that one might chose to worry about only when all other issues have been solved. No ambitious business can afford to ignore the momentous goal of improving levels of emotional maturity.</span></p>

<p class="p1">It’s an agreed part of joining any modern office that we quite quickly get to know the quirks of people around us. Because many of these quirks are weird and distressing, we often feel an urge to chat about them with others, perhaps in the coffee shop around the corner from the office. This activity is sometimes dismissed as mere ‘gossip,’ but something important is going on when we air views on, for example, the manner of the guy in sales or the notorious temper of the IT chief. We are chatting because we are frightened and upset and want to air our puzzlement at how others behave. We gossip in order to release tension – and because collaboration is so hard.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Office gossip tends to feel extremely individual (it’s all about Megan or Dave or Ida), but if one takes a step back, all the endless permutations of complaint we have about people tend to boil down to some core flaws that keep recurring in people. There are, in our eyes, ten problematic character traits in people that make office life so hard.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">                                            Ten Anti-Collaboration Traits</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensiveness is an a priori need to reject criticism. It raises the cost of disagreement hugely, for whenever a defensive person meets with anything, however small, which is negative about themselves and their behaviour, their response is both very large and extremely severe. This is because, inside themselves, they take the attack to be entirely personal and therefore catastrophic. There is in their minds no distinction between a criticism of their work – and a criticism of their very being and right to exist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It becomes deeply depressing to have any sort of tricky discussion with them about anything. It’s guaranteed to flare up. One wants to point out that something is a little late; but is there really a point when a drama is going to ensue? Organisations can put up with defensive people for a long time, but the relationship tends to get more and more joyless – and eventually, no one is too sad when a decision is taken to part ways.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Irrational Rivalry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rivalry can be very beneficial: for example, when you have two sales teams seeking the best quarterly results; two research groups pursuing different strategies to solve a major problem; or many analysts competing to provide the most accurate and most useful overview of an issue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are individuals who bring rivalry into areas that don’t require it – and certainly don’t benefit from it. For example, a busy executive is assigned a smart young assistant to take some of the less complex issues off their desk. But instead of making the best use of this help and streamlining their own efforts, the executive starts to worry that their assistant is doing too well; they think (incorrectly) that if the assistant is a success, their own job will soon disappear. So they start to make life difficult for them. They get reluctant to pass on tasks and they get extremely agitated the day their assistant is praised by the CEO. They would rather some of their work was done badly, or not at all, than that their helper should do it well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It feels as if there is only space for one of them to thrive and they are in competition for the limited affection of a superior. This is the definition of irrational rivalry: rivalry with no sane productive business end.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: People-Pleasing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People-pleasing means a manic terror of passing on information, however important, that might upset others. It is deeply problematic, for it confuses being polite with withholding information. It blurs the line between lying and pleasing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Successful nations and businesses are never sentimental around bad news: they are founded on the principle of the free flow of the most awkward bits of information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Negativity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The negative person knows things are going to go wrong. They’ve been there before – and can’t resist pointing out drawbacks and dangers. In their mind, being negative is the way to be wise: it means seeing through the foolish delusions and naive hopes of others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Collaborating with them is hard: they kill ideas very early.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Negativity belongs to a mindset that might rudely be called inner feudalism.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some part of their brains, the guys doing the threshing know that big decisions are taken all the time, castles get built, people rise to power and courage make fortunes. But in their own lives, none of these feats seem remotely possible. They have been inculcated with the view that no improvements are likely, everything will stay the same and if you try to improve things you’ll get into trouble and it will all go wrong anyway. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outwardly the age of feudalism is long, long gone. But inwardly, some of its characteristics remain even in a time of democracy, freedom and laptop computers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Bluster</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first they can seem rather exciting to work with. They like throwing out big ideas, and are great at sketching exciting scenarios about how everything might work out. But there’s a snag. Their optimism is excessive &#8211; and compulsive. They refuse to consider the downsides seriously, even when something is inherently rocky. They regard anxiety about possible bad outcomes as a sign of weakness. They won’t take risks seriously. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are very difficult to collaborate with because they tend to be impatient with detail, which they regard as unimportant. They see concern with specifics as ‘fussy’, hardly worth bothering about. It’s as if, at some point, they had been over-exposed to a very unhelpful picture of what it means to focus on details. They suffered at the hands of someone a bit too plodding and unimpressive, someone genuinely pedantic and nit picking. And now lots of things that are actually very important are seen by them as mere ‘fussing&#8230;’. They are perhaps in flight from an over-protective, over-cautious mother.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charles Dickens’ character Mr. Micawber (from the novel <em>David Copperfield</em>) is full of bluster and ill-grounded optimism. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He always believes that ‘something will turn up’ and has a remarkable ability to fail to learn anything from his past troubles. The difficulty is that moment by moment he appears confident and reasonable. He talks well (in general terms) about the opportunities and all the projects he has on the go. It can take some time before one realises that this person’s confidence is not in fact well-grounded &#8211; and is in fact highly dangerous to the whole team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Over-Control</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The control-freak has a horror of letting other people do things. No matter how pressed for time or overburdened they might be, they are very reluctant to let any decisions or tasks leave their desk. Sharing and delegating causes them real anxiety. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Control is often a virtue. It means taking responsibility for getting something right; it’s the conviction that certain tasks are worth a lot of personal effort. But in patterns of over-control, other people are always seen as obstacles to doing things well. They are just a bunch of idiots, somehow in the way of getting to a good result.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Secret Manoeuvring</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret manoeuvring is a pattern of behaviour whereby one quickly gives up on the people one is meant to be collaborating with, fails to talk to them about one’s disappointments &#8211; and instead works around them with the help of a few select not-always-officially-sanctioned colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A secret manoeuvrer may seem supportive; and may appear to have taken a suggestion quite positively. In the meeting, they didn’t raise any objection. They gave you a big smile. They sent you a message saying they thought your idea was very interesting. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What you don’t realise yet is that behind the scenes, they have a very different attitude. This is a person who is determined to get their way. But they don’t want to risk stating their intentions openly. They very much dislike confrontations and show downs. Even acknowledging disagreement can be quite upsetting to them. However, they are not at all passive or willing just to put up with things they don’t like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They just hate conflict a lot and despair of others very fast. They worry that if they have to convince everyone, nothing will get achieved. They are pessimistic about communication. So they go intently to work &#8211; only you won’t see what they are up to. They hate the idea of keeping people informed. They set up secret side groups. It’s meant to be a collaboration between 20 equals. But they go out and hire two external consultants who they set up alongside the 20 that are meant to be doing the job. Secret manoeuvrers are constantly quickly losing faith with the people they’re meant to be working with, and briefing against their intended collaborators behind their backs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6916" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="3239021382_9c9f70ca28_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all sounds dark and Machiavellian &#8211; but it’s important to realise where the secret manoeuvring is coming from. It’s the outcome of a deeply ambitious personality that has very low faith in others and in their own ability to work through a problem with someone. In their personal life, the secret manoeuvrer may well have a lover and a spouse: they’re disappointed with the partner they married, but they haven’t come around to expressing what they really feel. It seemed better to steer around the conflict and start up a new relationship on the side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re doing in business a version of what they’re doing in their marriage. They’re devoting themselves to ‘lovers’ because they can’t tolerate the tensions and ambiguities of sticking with the group they’ve originally pledged themselves to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Unfriendliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are people at work who don’t do ‘nice’. They quickly let you know that they don’t waste their time on (as they see it) the minor niceties of massaging people’s egoes, giving out the occasional words of encouragement, smiling or asking about how the holidays went.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are markedly abrupt. They tell you straight out they didn’t much like your ideas. They thought your section of the report was poorly presented &#8211; and weakly argued. They never seem to sugar-coat bad news. They won’t soften the blow. They are almost impossible to impress. And their demeanour suggests they really don’t think your approval is worth having in the first place. They tend to regard more gentle behaviour as a mere disguise for inefficiency. They bring the mood down. They don’t stoke enthusiasm. They are cynical about rousing speeches. They feel they have to be mean to win. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: Slyness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the end of the table, looking perhaps rather dapper or elegantly turned out, there’s one member of the team who seems not quite to regard things as serious. They can be very charming and good company (for a while). But they give the impression they are just ‘holidaying’ at the company; or that they are working for ‘fun’ rather than because they really have to. In some way their reasons for being here are not like those of others. Some large part of their life, which they hint at but don’t fully describe, is more important than what is going on in the room. Maybe they are about to inherit a fortune, maybe in their bedroom they designed an app which is about to go global, maybe a relative owns the whole corporation and they’re working incognito to get a feel for the various departments before taking over. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are quietly superior. They don’t seem to care a great deal how things turn out. Their contributions make people laugh, or lighten the mood &#8211; but they don’t really seem to grapple with the issues. And somehow they never seem to end up doing the more grinding tasks. They often have to head off to a lunch; their use of the expense account is technically right but somehow wrong in spirit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At an industry reception, you notice them chatting in a very chummy way to a senior person in a rival firm. You’d not be surprised if they were saying some rather mean things about their colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a pain collaborating with them because you never quite feel they are making a full effort. They give the impression the group isn’t good enough for them. They are special, while the rest of us &#8211; sadly &#8211; are not. Sly superiority can be grounded in injured narcissism. It’s a desperate, and fragile response to a nagging insecurity about just joining in and admitting that this is your gang &#8211; for better and for worse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ten: Non-Listening</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you’re speaking they nod; they might make an occasional note; they look at you. They go through the externals of listening. But actually, they are not paying attention to what you say. In their head they already feel they know the key things. They are just politely allowing you to ventilate. But your words cannot actually be important.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A variant on non-listening is to speak too much; it’s grounded in the same lack of curiosity about what other people think. The person who speaks too much isn’t merely hogging the conversation. They are in fact demonstrating they they are not a good listener. In their mind, listening is the inferior position, speaking is the sign of status. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not surprising that listening isn’t done so well very often: we have some very powerful collective conceptions of the power of speechifying.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The flip side of this is the idea that it is slightly shameful to have to listen. One is back at school, an infant.</span></p>

<h3 class="p1">                                           BETTER COLLABORATION</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s normal, when we think about the problems at work, to think first and foremost about that highly troublesome category: <em>other people</em>. Their flaws are so obvious, so irritating, so hurtful…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can therefore take a long while &#8211; but this is no sign of evil on our part &#8211; before we realise that, logically-speaking, the faults cannot merely belong to others. Slowly, a realisation dawns: we must by necessity have flaws of our own when it comes to working with others. That’s when we should start to ask some key questions: what do we think we are like to work with? What makes us troublesome? What might people be saying about us when a gossip session happens out of earshot?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are deeply tricky questions. Our self-love, that coating of protection we need in order to drag ourselves through life, generally resists such unpeeling. And yet, we would be wise to go in for enquiries of this sort, because we’re always likely to be one part of what makes any collaborative activity go well or badly. Furthermore, we have unique access to ourselves. We don’t have to ask anyone permission or worry about issues of seniority. We can start right away &#8211; and feed back to ourselves without fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But to begin the process, we have to relax, which means legitimating the idea that everyone, and that includes us, is a little crazy and damaged. And that’s very much OK. Our madness and eccentricity is a given, and no sign of pathology. Of course we’re hard to work with and quite tricky. We’re human. The issue isn’t whether or not we have problems. It’s just a case of determining which ones we have &#8211; and then trying to do something, ever so modest, about improving them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What flaws do you think you have…?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Take the list of the 10 immaturities and grade yourself against them from 0 to 10.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Whenever you go over a five, stop and reflect.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Then tell us/yourself a story about when you were immature in collaborating… &#8211; and what happened.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Where did the difficulty come from in your character? What were you scared about? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">How does your immaturity relate to your past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Theory of Transference</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What makes each of us hard to work with is that we carry certain rather unhelpful ideas around with us about what other people are going to be like, how they will behave towards us, and what will happen when we say and do a variety of things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all have a ‘history’ that unbalances our responses to the presence. It heavily predisposes us to interpret current reality in certain ways, and to twist the evidence according to a narrative that feels familiar &#8211; but may be deeply unproductive for everyone concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task of emotional maturity at the office means getting on top of one’s history, realising the exaggerated dynamics one is bringing to situations and monitoring oneself more accurately and more critically so as to improve one’s capacity to judge and act on situations more neutrally and sensibly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The origins of our distorted behaviour patterns lie in something known as<em> transference</em> – a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature – that we cobbled together in our past, in childhood to meet a threat that we were at that time too vulnerable, immature and inexperienced to cope with properly. We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to the difficulties of adulthood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy – and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is even distantly evocative of our earlier troubles. Perhaps we had chaotic, unreliable parents whom we dealt with by rigidly organising our room, arranging books by size, and reacting with alarm at the slightest bit of dust – and even now, outer disorder ushers in a panicky feeling within that everything is out of control once again. Or we had a sister who was always late to events that mattered to us, or a mother who was both humiliating and obsessed by fashion.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The outer world is constantly putting in front of us situations that are relatively ambiguous and look quite a lot like ones from the past. Unfortunately, the unconscious mind is very bad at distinguishing the present from the past, and reality from ambiguity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because transference happens without us knowing it, we generally can’t explain why we are behaving as we are. We carry years behind us that have no discernible shape, which we have forgotten about and which we aren’t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We just come across as a bit weird or extreme in certain areas. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Key to building up emotional maturity is working out where transference might be occurring. To do this, we have to ask ourselves a lot of questions, in private, or perhaps with the help of a coach or therapist. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can get a sense of the weight of the past on the present by considering ‘transference exercises.’ The most famous of these is the Rorschach test, devised in the 1930s by the psychologist Hermann Rorschach to help people to learn more about the contents of the hard-to-reach parts of their own minds. By being shown an ambiguous image and asked to say what it was, Rorschach believed that we would naturally reveal some of our latent guiding fears, hopes, prejudices and assumptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The important point in any Rorschach test is that the image has no one true meaning. Different people merely see different things in it according to what their past predisposes them to imagine. To one individual with a rather kindly and forgiving conscience, the image below could be seen as a sweet mask, with eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks. Another, more traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6415" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take another classic transference exercise:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6416" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image06.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s key that this image is ambiguous. You can read it many different ways, and that’s the point: to make you aware of your characteristic instances of transference by teasing them out with an inconclusive image.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of this image, people might say things like:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or: I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thing we do know – really – is that the picture doesn’t show any of these things, it simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it. And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. This is what one means by transference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A third transference exercise asks us to say the first thing that comes to mind when we try to finish certain sentences. For example:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Men are generally…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Women are almost always…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. When I fall in love, what’s bound to happen is…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. When someone I care about is late, it must be because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. The kitchen is in chaos, and it’s evidence that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. When I hear someone described as ‘very intellectual’, I imagine them being…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because these sentences aren’t about a concrete situation in the present, the only way to answer them is by calling up transferences from the past. Our responses hence give us a clue as to a bias in our minds that would normally be invisibly applied, merging imperceptibly with the dilemmas of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mature people are ready to accept that they might be involved in multiple transferences. Ideally, we should all rationally disentangle and un-distort our transferences and explain them to others in good time. But it rarely happens and collectively we pay a big price for our ignorance. We keep making things tough for everyone by over- and under-reacting – and so our work relationships are far harder than they need to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s consider the key areas of professional psychological distortion &#8211; and try to suggest some questions and exercises that can get us thinking more fruitfully about why we react the way we do:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensiveness tends to be the result of having internalised the voices of people in our past who judged us very severely and left us feeling not just that we did this or that problematic thing but far more catastrophically: that we might have been purely and simply ‘bad’. For the defensive among us, it doesn’t take much to be reminded of our proclivities to feel attacked. The slightest complaint can take us back to the original trauma. It’s therefore key to try to trace back the critical wound to its source &#8211; so as to develop a capacity to separate what belongs to the past from the give and take of office life today.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1">Berthe Morisot, <em>Le berceau</em> (1872)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However robust we may appear to others as adults, we all have a profound history of vulnerability. A baby is so small and delicate (though it can scream its head off if it doesn’t get fed), it’s worth pondering on its basic helplessness &#8211; and feeling a moment of compassion towards it and ourselves. We were all once hugely dependent on other people for our needs: we couldn’t speak or explain what we wanted, we had to rely on them to understand us, soothe us and be kind to us&#8230; Some of us enjoyed the touching care evoked by the painting above by Berthe Morisot  &#8211; minus the mosquito net over the bassinet, perhaps. Some of us were not so lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not surprising, therefore, if those among us who weren’t quite so carefully nurtured sometimes get a little extreme in our responses to attack, if we become &#8211; as the phrase goes &#8211; a bit defensive. There were once so many ways we could get seriously hurt and we had to develop some ways of defending ourselves as best we could. Our minds had to get used to being on high alert, always on battle stations, waiting for the next attack to come over the horizon. Anyone could have been the enemy. This becomes a plausible stance when you’ve been let down by someone you should have been able to rely on absolutely. It’s not surprising if, in adult life, some of us find we’ve built up a set of habits somewhat out of proportion with the threats we actually face, if we bridle at the first hint of criticism &#8211; not because we are bad,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but because it feels like this is the start of major assault and we would be running an intolerable risk were we not to strike back immediately. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The habits have become rather a liability now, of course. People get upset with defensive behaviour, and promotions aren’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>handed out so readily to those who, at the first hint of criticism, flare up, but we didn’t get<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>like this without some good reasons &#8211; reasons which we should (in calm moments) strive to trace back to their origins, fully understand and gently try to overcome.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In the past, did you receive the support you needed?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Who let you down?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How and when?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did a person’s criticism ever help you solve a problem? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How might you have criticised yourself if you’d needed to?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What would it feel like to be a friend to yourself?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Imagine you are your boss. Try to criticise your work but not who you are. What would you need to hear?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To recognise &#8211; without shame &#8211; and understand sympathetically, why one has become defensive is the key to unwinding the habits of excessive self-protection. We need to see that we’re warding off dangers that were experienced as very real in the past, but which don’t actually threaten us anything like so much today. We needed those defences once. Now we can afford to let them go. We’re truly strong, strong enough not to need to greet the world with armour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider this little School of Life film, which lightly sends up the difficulties associated with being over-defensive.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Irrational Rivalry</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Early on, there must somehow have been a feeling that there wasn’t enough love to go around. So we learned to compete, and to worry about anyone else who might be in a position to hog the attention more properly due to us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">-  Who was a difficult rival for you early on?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">-<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whose attention or approval were you competing for? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How did it feel when you thought you were being rejected, overlooked or sidelined? How did you react? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- From the perspective of today, how do you think that person really saw you &#8211; and how did they see your rival?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Was there anything that could have reassured you at the time? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next, perhaps consider this picture by<em> Pierre Prud’hon: Portrait of Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck and Family</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image22.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6418" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image22.jpg?resize=543%2C541" alt="image22" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They all look kind, charming and reasonable. But imagine that the children are in the grip of irrational rivalry. The boy is obsessed with the idea that the girl gets more love from the father. The girl knows the mother prefers the boy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The parents are sure that there is enough love and attention to go round; they feel they are being careful to be fair, not to have favourites. But this may not be at all how the children experience things. Love, they feel, is a finite resource and they aren’t getting enough. If this has been a big issue in our own development, then as we grow older, we are liable to bring this pattern of experience to lots of apparently very different situations. So at work, it can feel as if there is direct competition for the approval of ‘the grown ups’ &#8211; anyone more senior in the organisation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A fix involves a shift of focus. In the picture we can pay attention either to the children or to the parents. Look at the children for a moment. Take in their faces. When we’re focusing on them, of course we can understand how rivalry gets established. It’s totally unsurprising they might feel that way. But we can equally focus attention on the parents. When we do that, we see how unnecessary and tragic the rivalry actually is, because the children are not in fact competing for affection. The parents are full of love. The struggle isn’t real.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we feel drawn into excessive rivalry, we should shift attention from our own longings to the point of view of those we are appealing to for affection, esteem, promotion, money. What we have to ask ourselves is: are they in fact keen to reward only one person? Or would they much rather (as good parents do) have two lovely, healthy, strong successful ‘children’/office workers? Does it make sense from <em>their</em> point of view to allow only you OR your rival (but not both) to succeed?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. People-Pleasing</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Somewhere in the past, saying what you felt seemed very dangerous indeed. People-pleasing has its roots in a feeling that you could not be both truthful and loved. Who you were was not enough. You had to dissemble and lie and try to humour someone who appeared distracted, angry, irrational or mean. You were not allowed to be the focus of your own world when you needed to be. You had to find a way to cope &#8211; and you did it by attempting to find out what every person you dealt with wanted, and then trying &#8211; desperately – to give it to them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In one of his plays, Shakespeare gives a quick sketch of just such a formative experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6419" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="image16" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes it feels too dangerous to tell the truth.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At one point in Shakespeare’s <em>Antony and Cleopatra </em>– Act II Scene V –<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a poor messenger has to tell Cleopatra that her lover, Antony, has spurned her and married someone else. The queen offers the messenger a fortune to say it’s not so … </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra</em>: Say &#8217;tis not so, a province I will give thee, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And make thy fortunes proud.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Messenger</em>: He&#8217;s married, madam. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra</em>: I&#8217;ll unhair thy head: She strikes him</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thou shalt be whipp&#8217;d with wire, and stew&#8217;d in brine,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Messenger:</em> Gracious madam, </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I that do bring the news made not the match. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Cleopatra:</em> Rogue, thou hast lived too long. <em>Draws a knife. </em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shakespeare is showing us a terrifying version of the person who makes it very hard for you to tell them the truth. When you’ve tried to tell the truth and been almost killed for it, it isn’t surprising if you become a bit more careful next time and slowly turn into a people-pleaser. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What important figure in your early life were you afraid of upsetting with your truths or your being?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What happened if you were just ‘yourself’ and honest with them?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Where, today, does this kind of danger lurk for you? Who are you afraid of upsetting?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What would actually be likely to happen if you told them the truth?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How bad would that really be?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6420" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image11.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="image11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone could draw their own portrait of the intimidating individual.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us grew up around intimidating types a little like the man in the portrait above. You felt you had to be incredibly careful around them. You were walking on eggshells, terrified of setting them off. They had to be kept in a good mood as much as possible. It could have been an irate father, an overwrought mother, an explosive elder sister; a teacher who seemed to have it in for you; or a harsh early boss. Whomever it was, a pattern of anxiety was laid down. One grew extremely aware of the dangers of upsetting people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once we get more conscious of how this way of seeing others got started, we can begin to sense that &#8211; probably &#8211; it’s not really called for so much in our lives today around the office. Without quite noticing it, we may be sticking with an unfortunate habit that was formed &#8211; very understandably &#8211; to deal with a big problem that belongs very much in the past now, ten or fifteen years ago. It’s a tragedy of emotional life that certain habits have a tendency to stick around even though the situation that originally gave rise to them may have long since changed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to be firmer in ourselves. We’ve adopted an ideal of being pleasing which is in fact not pleasing to anyone in the long term. Put yourself in the shoes of those you’re afraid of. Is it really so nice to be sentimentally lied to? People need to know the bad news to fix it. What small bit of the truth could you start to share with those who run the business everyone wants to see succeed? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Negativity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learn to be negative when life seems to teach us that hope and aspiration are unrealistic and dangerous. And there are definitely times when absorbing a negative stance seems the mark of open-eyed realism and maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What really disappointed you in the past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What was the hope that got crushed? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you deeply wish could have turned out better than it did?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What are you afraid of when you hope?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What might happen if you tried and didn’t succeed?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image141.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6422" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image141.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="image14" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting your hopes up is a very bad idea</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, life really is pretty harsh. At particular times, in specific places, supposing that things can easily get a lot better can be a naive delusion. It’s the danger of focusing on what you want to happen, instead of preparing for what’s likely to happen. There are lots and lots of cases where people come unstuck because they didn’t factor in the potential down-side. So, negativity makes a lot of sense. There are hopes we really would be wise not to nurture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pictures above and below are by the Swiss-American photographer Robert Frank, who travelled around the United States in 1957, taking images for what would become a very famous book called <em>The Americans</em>. It shows us the often bleak reality of a country whose self-image is of relentless positivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the real landscape of our lives, is it such a wonder that many of us grow a defensive shield of pessimism and negativity? Can we not be forgiven for failing to greet pitiless reality with a smile?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image30.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6423" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image30.jpg?resize=635%2C413" alt="image30" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t get your hopes up around here.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing is: it’s not that always sensible to hose down hope. An attitude of pessimism may really have been needed at key times in our lives, but it isn’t always a requirement. It can keep insisting that we prepare for the worst when, actually, the circumstances are replete with genuine opportunities for those who can bear the vulnerability of hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Bluster</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, we get it into our heads that concern with detail is how one loses sight of &#8211; and connection with &#8211; the important and serious things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did anyone close to you fuss quite a lot in the past?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Was anyone a bit pedantic (though that might not have been the word you’d have used at the time)?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How were such people regarded by you and others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In your experience, what happens when people are too fussy?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s really to be expected that encounters with unimpressive, irksome fussy and pedantic people will leave us with a negative impression of the value of looking after the details. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fix is to revise our conception of what is important &#8211; and specifically of the relation between the little (apparently minor) things and the big picture issues. The largest waterfall in Europe is in Switzerland,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>on the river Rhine at Schaffhausen. In the 19th century, it was one of the most prestigious subjects for painters, because it represented extraordinary energy, drama and grandeur. Turner painted it around 1805. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6424" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image12.jpg?resize=635%2C393" alt="image12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">J.M.W. Turner, The Fall of the Rhine at Schaffhause (1805-6)</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But much to the surprise of certain critics, Turner didn’t just concentrate his attention on the obvious major facts: the cliffs, the water thundering over, the spray. He also took great care to paint accurately a couple of wicker baskets in the foreground; he depicted the neat way some white packages had been tied. What was he doing. Why did he bother with such things? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The explanation was delivered by Turner’s great advocate, John Ruskin, who formulated the principle of <em>The Task of the Least</em>: ‘the minutest portion of a great composition is helpful to the whole. It certainly does not seem easily conceivable that this should be so. But it is the fact.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The little details<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>don’t distract from the big effect; they are essential to creating it. The thundering effect of the water is enhanced by including a humble, static object like a basket and a parcel. By attuning the eye to precision, the artist is priming us to be more responsive to the swirling chaos of the falls. The details aren’t a distraction from the grand effect, they help cause it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a limited arena on a canvas, Turner is making a case for keeping an eye on the task of the least. We should pay attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. Over-Control</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The desire to control springs from the natural response of a competent, energetic person to the imagined lesser abilities of others. In some situations that perception is bang on target. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Fill in the rest of the sentence: when it comes to working properly, most people are &#8230;</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did your early caregivers trust others? Did they trust you?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How competent were your parents? Could you trust them to get it right?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did your parents trust other people?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Where do you think your negative assessment of others’ potential came from?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Describe an early success around taking charge of some task that others clearly couldn’t manage through incompetence.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1"> &#8211; What often happens when you try to get others to help with a task?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Could you ever teach people to be better at the tasks you want to help them with?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Competence is not universally and equally distributed. Some people really are a lot more on the ball than others. And it’s no bad thing if they take the lead in organising how things should be done. We ramp up our demand to have control and to have things done our way in response to some well-grounded worries about how things are currently going. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Throughout the 1970s, a number of UK car factories – particularly one at Longbridge, in the south of Birmingham &#8211; earned a reputation for low-quality workmanship, inefficiency and poor management.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/489675439.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6919" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/489675439.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Protest Against Cowley Strike" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you spent a lot of time around such places and people, you could justifiably come away with the opinion that a lot of people really are pretty incompetent. You might well reach the conclusion that you, personally, could to a lot better if you just managed everything yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image18.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6431" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image18.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="image18" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Panicked impatience makes sense in a world of wasteful incompetence</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The question, though, isn’t<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>whether being controlling is ever a good idea. Sometimes, clearly, it is. But it depends: we’ve got a marked tendency for our instincts to be governed not so much by what actually confronts us today, but by what we became most familiar with at formative points in the past. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If &#8211; to pursue a thought experiment &#8211; Margaret Thatcher had spent a lot of the 1970s around the Swiss National Railways she might have arrived at different conclusions about the average levels of human competence. She might have learnt to trust that an entire team could be galvanised to be competent and efficient, from the signal controllers in Basel to the station master at the remote outpost of Ennetbürgen in central Switzerland.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It all depends on the skills of managers at generating an atmosphere of community and collaboration. Talent isn’t only ever the preserve of just a few: with the right structures in place, it can be a resource of the many. It may be time to exchange the trauma of Longbridge for the faith and hope animating the SBB team.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Secret Manoeuvring</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going behind other people’s backs doesn’t sound very nice when stated directly. But it was not an unreasonable strategy in many of our pasts. From particular situations, we may have developed the<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ways of operating that can be summed up with the term ‘secret manoeuvring’. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When you were young, who was it not worthwhile ever trying to talk to or change others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you imagine they would have done if you’d tried?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When someone has done something wrong, is your impulse to a) say something b) leave it and move on?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Do you sometimes feel that people betray you? What do you do? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How do you think people will respond if you tell them you have an issue with them?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Suppose someone on the team seems to be a little less bright and determined than you thought: what do you do?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secret manoeuvring is a vote of no-confidence in the power of persuasion or education. We resort to behind the scenes arrangements because we’ve had some bad experiences in which our intentions have met with blank stares or hostility and people have refused to change their ways when we attempted to tell them how we felt. We have somewhere in our deep minds drawn a big conclusion: there’s no point in arguing and directly dealing with people.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Under pressure and not sure of other people</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he was Prime Minister, Gordon Brown developed a reputation as someone who was more than usually willing to deal with colleagues by subterfuge rather than face-to-face dialogue. He reportedly deployed his private office to undermine the position of cabinet ministers who were &#8211; to the public eye &#8211; his personal appointees. Rather than convince his colleagues in discussion, or directly assert the authority of his position, he would allegedly give off the record instructions to special assistants he had installed in the relevant civil service department, thus effectively (but secretly) cutting ministers out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If this picture is accurate, the motives for acting in this underhand way need not be entirely sinister. In fact, the ambition is poignant and touching. Gordon Brown was a prime minister with an overwhelming sense of duty and responsibility to the nation, someone who felt he was under great pressure from rivals and from the opposition parties. He also felt that most other people were not quite up to scratch. So in order to get into action the policies he truly believed were in the public interest, he would have felt he had no option but to resort to subterfuge. He had desperately little confidence in his own power to cajole and chivvy his major colleagues; he lacked the maturity to trust in his own ability to gradually draw the best out of people. He felt he had no choice but to go behind their backs &#8211; and make it all happen as it should, without quite talking about it. He was acting disastrously, for the best of reasons&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">8. Unfriendliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, of course, everyone wants to be friendly. But, we can grow up feeling that friendliness (and what goes with it &#8211; trusting, niceness, sharing) is too costly. It can simply look like it’s the wrong strategy for success. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Exercise: </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Which person from your past gave you a sense that nice guys don’t finish first?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What do you worry could go wrong if you took the time to be friendly?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What happens to nice people, in your view?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not unfriendly because we’re mean or inherently misanthropic, but because niceness has come to seem weak and indulgent. Partly, that’s a matter of prestige. A lot of successful people seem in a great hurry and are rather brusque, and we therefore pick up from them the suggestion that success is dependent on a brutal manner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we need to be exposed to are examples of friendliness working in synch with professional success. From 161 to 180 AD &#8211; the period he ruled as an exceptionally conscientious Roman Emperor &#8211; Marcus Aurelius was officially the busiest man in the world. At any one time he might be fighting off Germanic tribes on the north-east frontier while dealing with incursions by the Parthians in the south east; attempting to control the currency of the imperial economy; acting as the highest judge and simultaneously reforming major areas of the legal system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image19.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6435" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image19.jpg?resize=635%2C559" alt="image19" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marcus Aurelius was, by temper and character, inclined to be brusque and dismissive. He was enraged by time-wasters. But he knew in his heart that this wasn’t the way to go. So he tried hard to train himself to temper his irritations with others: they were not, he told himself, wicked inherently so much as sometimes lazy and expedient, as he could be. In his <em>Meditations</em> he wrote rules for himself: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can&#8217;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognised that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own—not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine.</em> (II. 1) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He also reminded himself of attitudes he admired. He thought a lot about one of his mentors, a man called Sextus who, he wrote, had </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>a benevolent disposition: gravity without affectation; able to tolerate ignorant persons and those who form opinions without consideration. He had the power of readily accommodating himself to all; he could express approval without noisy display; he possessed much knowledge without ostentation.</em> [Meditations, book I]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because, like us, he was tempted to be unfriendly, Marcus Aurelius reminded himself on a daily basis that it is entirely possible to be serious, focused and efficient without coming across as rude or unconcerned. If the effort was important enough for him, it should surely be important enough for all of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">9. Slyness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The feeling that the people around you don’t actually deserve your full commitment and loyalty doesn’t sound very nice. We’d like to think of ourselves as always ready to give our best. But sometimes a person can easily be forgiven for feeling that their colleagues don’t actually deserve much respect.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">To cope here, you’d probably need to get a bit sly.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason we end up being a bit sly is because full participation doesn’t present itself as attractive enough. We’re sly when we feel we’d rather not be part of the team. We need to feel a little more special than others. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- How are you different from others?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- In the past, who made you feel special?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Did that feeling of specialness come under threat at some point?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Who was hard to please (but you wanted to please them)? </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- What are groups typically like?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6438" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="1080px-The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone in that group is perfect, but they’re good enough… and they’re better for being part of the group.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This painting, by Rembrandt, might help. Imagine you are with them, part of the night watch. You’re going out on a dreary night to interfere with drunks, move on the troublemakers and keep an eye out for thieves and burglars. It beats being at home, because you’re doing it with other people. Those in your team, admittedly, won’t all be your ideal companions or colleagues. Some might be a bit self-regarding, others a bit timid; some are bossy, some are weak. <em>The Night Watch</em> speaks of the appeal of joining in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These people are heading out to patrol the streets on a wet night. But it’s an inviting image. And it would probably be nice to join in if we could. Companionship can be so much better than an isolated, fragile sense of being distinctive. The message of the picture isn’t that the members of the team are all wonderful in and of themselves. But, rather, that it is still worth joining in because a team has something that any one individual won’t: it ennobles all those who take part.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">10. Not listening</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can easily get impatient with a person who doesn’t listen &#8211; but not-listening can have honourable origins. Even though it becomes a problem when we need to collaborate, not listening doesn’t always originate as a failing. At some moments in development, not listening is key. There may be so many voices, so much noise that can threaten to submerge us, it is a survival strategy to close the doors and focus on a single voice you need to hold on to and have a responsibility towards: your own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When was your voice stifled?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Were you listened to as a child?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When did you feel you had to listen to someone else a lot?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- Are you heard enough?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">- When do you feel that what another person is saying is very unhelpful to you?</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1973, the American literary critic Harold Bloom published a seminal book of criticism titled <em>The Anxiety of Influence</em>. In it, he describes how many great writers have suffered from an anxiety about listening too much to the voices of their predecessors. The artists of the past teach us how to write and feel, but they also &#8211; unwittingly &#8211; often threaten to silence the creative potential of the present moment, through their sheer eloquence and brilliance. They stifle our own nascent sensibilities. In Bloom’s view, only a few writers in any generation ever manage to escape from the unhelpful impact of their predecessors &#8211; and go on to produce something which is properly distinctive. Interestingly, says Bloom, these path-breakers do so by a rather odd- and suspicious-sounding strategy, which we can nevertheless learn from. They shut out the voices of others; they acquire the art of not listening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bloom might have been writing primarily about poets of the early modern period, but his theory can be extended beyond the production of art. The story he is telling is simultaneously that of every human’s journey to maturity. In order to find your own voice, you do need &#8211; for a while &#8211; to bracket and silence the louder, more persuasive voices of those who have come before you. Culture provides us with a very reasonable account of why for all of us, at times, not-listening is likely to be a noble and important strategy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not-listening takes root in situations where there’s a genuine tussle, a real conflict between either taking in the points another person is making or exploring and developing your own insights. At certain moments, especially in childhood or at the beginning of a creative endeavour, this is the tussle we face. But &#8211; as with so many of our unhelpful behaviours around groups &#8211; we don’t have to stay stuck here: we can move beyond the vulnerability that first led us to adopt a particular and costly ‘defence’. We do not have to keep on always behaving as if we remained in the dangerous situation that first required a defence. We can, with effort and sympathy for ourselves, take a few modest steps towards opening our ears to the voices of others, ever more secure that our own distinctiveness will &#8211; once the meeting or chat is over &#8211; continue unscathed.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                           ***</p>
<p class="p1">Growing up isn&#8217;t ever quick, or really quite done. But to study these ten possible areas of immaturity signals a start of a journey towards solving some of the issues that bedevil office life and poison some of the most precious opportunities of our lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine someone who is deeply efficient. Their life is full of the best sorts of habits. They always take a break on Wednesday afternoon (unless there’s a crisis) and play a game of tennis or go swimming. They always get to their desk by 8.30; they always send polite thank you messages when people have been especially helpful or made a big effort. They always take time to fix the main outline of a document before elaborating the details. They always read through messages to check for silly spelling or content errors before sending. They always file important documents as soon as they get them or as soon as they are finished with them. They have set days when they clean up all their files.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve got a tendency to see this as a personality type. We imagine this person who was always like this; that at kindergarten they always took their left shoe off before their right shoe; that they are maybe sometimes a bit admirable (their working life does seem more tranquil) but also somewhat freakish. You can’t learn from them, you can only watch and wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, human beings are generally very good at acquiring habits. It’s just that various cultural forces have conspired to make habit formation look like an unimpressive, unexciting undertaking. At times ‘habit’ has even seemed like a dirty word – the name of something a bit shameful, boring and pitiful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The creature of habit is the man with his slippers by the fire puffing on a pipe, always reading the same pages of the newspaper, always switching on the television news at the same time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In order to get better at habit formation we need to… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Have a higher opinion of habits</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t regard habit as the closing of the prison house door, the dying of the daylight, the triumph of the average over the individual. Some habits are pitiful, it’s perfectly true. But the mere fact that something becomes routine, and therefore easy and reliable cannot itself be a bad thing. Ideally, habits are glamorous – if the habits themselves are beneficial ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Set a time</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic poet, Wordsworth, often wrote about the beauty of the moon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Lo! where the Moon along the sky </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Sails with her happy destiny; </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Oft is she hid from mortal eye </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Or dimly seen, </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">But when the clouds asunder fly </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">How bright her mien! </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Wordsworth surely hoped that other people would share his experiences and look at the moon more often; that they too might one evening wander over the hillside (or walk round to the shops) and turn their eyes upwards and perhaps see the moon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Wordsworth couldn’t make us care about the moon in the long-term, because he didn’t take enough of an interest in habit-formation. He left our interest in the moon up to chance and the fleeting inclination of the individual.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6053" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="10395218373_a5fc0b9f70_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Ryan Ozawa</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, Tsukimi, the Japanese ritual of moon-viewing, is scheduled to take place on specific dates: the 15th day of the eighth month and the 13th day of the ninth month (of the solar calendar). You don’t need to wait for the mood to take you; you don’t have to dip by chance into a book of poetry and find encouragement. The diary takes care of all this for you: you are supposed to take a careful look at the moon anyway. The approach sounds less romantic. But it is more aligned with the needs of human nature. The reality is that mostly we do need prompts and reminders to do things. And we should not feel awkward or ashamed about this. You set a date, write it in your diary. You make an appointment with the task. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we schedule occasions regularly enough, an activity becomes a habit. After six weeks or so, we stop having to look in the diary, we remember anyway. Each time (after that) it becomes easier, more natural to repeat, the firm of behaviour gets entrenched.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Someone checks up</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, habits are things we don’t need to make much of an effort around, they become second nature, we do them with hardly a thought. But getting there can involve a painful exercise of the will. We have to make ourselves do things against inner resistance. We have to force ourselves to get out of bed earlier or to work off-line. It’s tempting to give it a miss. It’s too much effort, usually at the very time one feels depleted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15266549241_42a88673bd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6932" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/15266549241_42a88673bd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="15266549241_42a88673bd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/US Army Europe Images</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The military have long exploited the idea of being checked up on as part of habit formation. At first, when you might still be reluctant to iron your trousers and wish you could get away with not polishing your shoes very vigorously, someone quite hard to please is sent round to inspect. But it’s assumed that this won’t have to go on forever. Instead most people will internalise their ambitions. And so, years after they have moved on to civilian life, they will continue to wear trousers with precise creases and highly polished shoes. The mere fact of reporting to another person gives us the tiny, but necessary, boost of determination to stick with something at the moment when we are most vulnerable to giving up. And so the habit is given a little longer to take hold. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to developing habits will look a little odd, but that’s OK… it’s a sign that we’re leaving behind some quite mistaken, but very widespread, views of how things get done. In a world in which inefficiency is the norm, to be an efficient person will involve learning some ways of behaving that seem pretty strange. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We find tasks irksome and frustrating – and so perform them less efficiently – when we think that we shouldn’t be doing them, that they are beneath us or a waste of our time and energy. But when a task has prestige and glamour, it’s easier to put more of ourselves into it.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that at times we feel irritated by, or maybe even a bit contemptuous of, routine, detail, and watching the clock. Our society has thrown up alarming numbers of examples of how all these things can crush the soul. There’s pedantry, conformism, just going through the motions, the person who is fussy and obsessed by the rules. So, it’s hardly surprising that we’ve raised a few collective monuments to those heroes (real and fictional) who break the rules, focus on the big picture and who never care about whether they are being efficient or meeting targets: Mick Jagger, Harry Potter, Kristen Stewart, Katniss Everdeen, Virginia Woolf…</p>

<p>One of the sources of inefficiency is the belief – buried somewhere in our brains – that routine, details and all the little tasks of organisation (the tidy drawers in the desk, not running out of post-it notes, keeping the address book up to the minute) is ignoble. There’s a tendency to feel that paying a lot of attention to such things is a sign of a lesser mind, that it’s what gets in the way of more important things being done.</p>
<p>We need a corrective. We need to remember than in truth, there have been some extremely interesting and inspiring people and objects tending in the opposite direction. The artist John Ruskin, for instance, was obsessed with the task of capturing every last detail of the feathers of a Kingfisher.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RuskinFeatherDrawings1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/RuskinFeatherDrawings1.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="RuskinFeatherDrawings1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h6><strong><strong>John Ruskin, <em>Feather Studies</em></strong></strong></h6>
<p>It wasn’t that he lacked the imagination or the verve or the breadth of mind to concern himself with anything bigger. Ruskin thought that details were very important. It wasn’t a climb down to be attentive to minutiae. On the contrary, he believed that it was precisely in the details that beauty or greatness existed. He believed – as did Flaubert and Mies van der Rohe – that ‘God is in the details’. Ruskin didn’t think it was beneath him to take infinite pains to match colour tones or to check he’d got every last strand the right length.</p>
<p>Ruskin is offering a corrective – if we need it – to the low status that routine and details often have. People end up being sloppy, scattered and (hence) inefficient not because by nature they are incapable of keeping their desk tidy or sorting out their files, but because they have the belief that such things ‘don’t really matter’; that it is boring and humiliating to have to be concerned with them.</p>
<p>Sloppiness is one of the enemies of efficiency. And to fix it, we need to understand it. Its source isn’t laziness. It&#8217;s misplaced idealism: the belief that the important things don’t connect with the details; the conviction that concern with little things means you cannot be looking at the big ones too. So, rather than try to terrify ourselves into paying greater attention to the apparently small stuff, the better fix is to get a more accurate vision of things. And, with people like Ruskin or Mies van der Rohe as a guide, to re-glamourise the little tasks which turn out to be, in fact, crucial for efficiency.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Human beings are pathetically prone to distraction. It’s almost comically easy to get us to stop concentrating on anything even a tiny bit challenging and turn gratefully to something more immediately gratifying or interesting and almost certainly a lot less productive; like picking one’s nose, viewing porn, checking whether there’s a custard cream in the biscuit tin, seeing what’s happening to the Greek economy or the career of Jeremy Clarkson.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all suffer from distraction. But collectively we have been very reluctant to take serious steps to address it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do a <em>few things</em>, of course: like have open plan offices and KPIs which won’t be met unless a person keeps their capacity for distraction under some kind of control. All the same, distraction remains a scourge and undermines our productivity to an astonishing degree. Because when we really are in focus and in the mood and fired up, it’s amazing what we can achieve in a short time. And hence slightly shocking to imagine what one might be able to do were the attention not always wandering off. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Middle Ages, it was widely agreed that the most important thing to think about was God. Today, the thing we most have to focus attention on is usually work. But unlike in our own day, back in the Middle Ages, leading figures were prepared to accept that asking for prolonged<em> non-distracted</em> attention means making a huge and very difficult (but maybe very important) demand on the fragile and wayward human psyche. They were prepared to see just how big and difficult a demand this really was for creatures like us – more naturally interested in things like feasting, sex, scratching their bottoms, hunting and gambling, than in pondering the divine nature, examining our own failings or seeking to understand the meaning of some of the more obscure sections of the Bible. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They took very seriously the problem of getting people to pay attention to what they considered the important things – and stop getting distracted. And they realised that you might need to take some pretty drastic-looking steps to keep the mind in focus on the key things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>One of the key moves they made was the invention of the Monastery. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia_complesso.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6938" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia_complesso.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="640px-Abbazia_di_Praglia,_complesso" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Praglia Abbey</h6>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The monastery made a range of dazzling innovations in the field of non-distraction studies. For example, it proposed that to avoid distraction, one might need to live far removed from towns and cities. The architecture should be rather grand and imposing – as a continual reminder of the importance of what you are doing. One should live on-site and not commute in. The walls are going to have to be high and thick. There can’t be lots of doors or big picture windows looking out onto the wider world. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Walls, cloisters and being a good few miles from the local tavernas certainly help in the fight against distraction;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but on their own, they are not enough. Medieval Christianity additionally developed <em>rules</em> about how to live in and use these buildings. One of the earliest and most influential rule-setters was a Roman nobleman living at the end of the 5th century, by the name of Benedict.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>He founded a number of monasteries in Italy and he wrote an instruction manual for his followers, with a simple and emphatic title: <em>The Rule</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/738px-Fra_Angelico_031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/738px-Fra_Angelico_031.jpg?resize=635%2C647" alt="738px-Fra_Angelico_031" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Early anti-distraction guru</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The rules were beautifully precise and detailed. They include thoughts on:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eating:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Rule 39: Except the sick who are very weak,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">let all abstain entirely</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">from eating the flesh of four-footed animals.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should consume modest, but nutritious, meals only twice a day (an occasional glass of wine is allowed). Lamb and beef are to be avoided. But chicken and fish in small quantities are helpful. During meals, people are not allowed to talk to one another. Instead they should listen to someone reading from an important and interesting book. If they need something they should make a signal with their hands.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Silence: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You need to be quiet quite a lot, and for this to be the norm. You are only allowed to talk in certain places and at certain times. Otherwise, keep quiet. When you do talk with others, gossip and malicious comments are strictly forbidden. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Hair and Clothing: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To avoid distraction you need to wear clothes that are basically the same as those of everyone else in the community. Something plain and useful. Not too expensive. Nothing to distract you there. Also, everyone must have their hair cut the same way – very very short. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Balance: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Rule 35: Let the brethren serve one another, </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">and let no one be excused from the kitchen service </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">except by reason of sickness </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are going to be concentrating quite a lot on ideas or intellectual activities you must take some physical activity everyday, something repetitive and soothing might be ideal: like sweeping the floor or weeding a row of lettuces. You must also occasionally take your turn preparing a meal or doing the washing up – everyone does. But mostly it will be other people’s turns so you’ll be free (and guilt free).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Ordering the day</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have to go to bed early and get up very early. Routine is crucial. You’ll be doing the same thing at the same time day after day. It will soon become a habit. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Keep sex away</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone is to dress and behave in a demure way. No encouragement to be given to sexual feelings. Sex plays havoc with any attempts to concentrate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At many strategic points in the buildings, you’ll see beautiful or dramatic works of art that remind you of some important idea or help you get into a useful mood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SanMarco.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/SanMarco.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="SanMarco" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">When you look up from your workstation – a reminder that suffering is an essential part of life </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we’re unlikely to be preoccupied with getting ourselves focused and distraction-free in the name of our relationship with God. It’s around work that this issue arises. Work is a hugely important theme in our lives and we’re expected (almost required) to spend years concentrating on writing reports or preparing accounts, pondering how best to give feedback or assessing the options for a new distribution terminal in Lancashire. We’ll manage it, but – as things stand – much much less efficiently that we ideally could. Much of the time we will be being paid to drag ourselves mentally back to the task in hand for another tiny burst before feeling the tug of a daydream, the speculation about where someone got their new shoes, the annoying way one’s hair is sticking up a bit on the left side, the decision about what kind of sandwiches to have for lunch… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a way to end the tragic dominance of distraction, we suggest a number of strategies, with the example of St Benedict in mind:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Office uniforms </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, elegant but modest enough to dampen down libidinous thoughts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Physical exercise</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Integrate brief doses of gardening or maintenance work into the schedule of executives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Ban the internet</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its sounds prudish, naive or dated. But it’s really ambition for our lives that drives this kind of censorship; and the humiliating admission that generally we are a bit rubbish at self-control. We can’t spend the rest of our lives checking the <em>Mail Online</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Chatter</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Periods of silence and collective reading are to be encouraged and personal gossip banned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Architecture</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tranquil, grand; facilities for periods of live-in work. Fewer open plan offices. More cells.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Art</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strategic reminders of the nobility of labour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you want to focus your mind on something serious and quite difficult, you’re probably going to have to take some quite radical steps to make this happen. You’re maybe going to have to look a bit weird and do things that will strike some people as rather odd. But that’s only because our society has not really admitted to itself how big a grip distraction actually has on us. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/306602858_42d9c92700_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6940" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/306602858_42d9c92700_z.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="306602858_42d9c92700_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s natural to think that it must be a huge advantage for artists living in Paris to have the Louvre on their doorstep. All that inspiration. All that encouragement. They can drop in at any time and see the works of the greatest masters. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> So, it can be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a bit of a shock to learn that quite a few of the most interesting artists have harboured very different feelings about the museum. Corot, Camille Pissarro, Apollinaire, Braque, Picasso, Gauguin, Léger, Duchamp:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>at various times in their lives they all expressed the same longing – to burn the place to the ground. They weren’t vandals or barbarians. They were just very alive to the way perfectly accomplished, majestic examples of art from the past stops you feeling creative confidence. The masterpieces make your own efforts look puny. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Think of a Bach concerto or the uncanny fit of words and music in Hey Jude; the white garden at Sissinghurst or the poetry of E. E. Cummings. These are some of the most prestigious, most loved, of all human creations. And yet, strangely, our admiration for them can be major impediments to ever ourselves reaching a good enough solution to the tasks we face in our own working lives. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Imagine you were really interested in painting, because you’d fallen in love with some of the works of Raphael.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/661px-Raffael_stcatherina.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6034" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/661px-Raffael_stcatherina.jpg?resize=635%2C543" alt="661px-Raffael_stcatherina" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">Raphael, <em>Saint Catherine of Alexandria</em> (1507)</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You might be keen to look at his paintings at every available opportunity, but doing so might be both thrilling and depressing. They are so gracious, so simple, so easy – every line is exactly as it should be. But then you think of your own very modest efforts. The smudges, the wobbly bits, the one that started as a portrait of your cat and that ended up as a picture of a storm cloud. You sit down to do a drawing after a visit to the National Gallery – and you feel paralysed. Whatever you do is sure to be wrong. Your love of the ideal has made it frightening and humiliating to do anything yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who don’t know where to start are often perfectionists. It’s an honourable problem: you’re doing nothing not because you’re lazy but because you’re very ambitious. Perfectionism is one of the causes of procrastination – because it makes us so worried about getting things wrong. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In general, we can only start working when the fear of not doing anything finally exceeds the fear of doing it badly. So, if the fear of doing it badly is vast, we won’t do much. Or, one is left in the miserable situation of being forced to confront terrifying things simply because there’s something even more terrifying in the other direction (like bankruptcy or expulsion).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To loosen the paralysing grip of perfectionism – and liberate our productive energies and become more efficient – there are four things we can do (without having to resort to incendiary attacks on French cultural monuments). </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">One: Visit the studio, not the gallery</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The gallery is where you can see the finished product. The studio is where you see the anguish, wrecked early versions, the ones with holes in them where the guy got so frustrated he kicked them and where there are watermarks on the paper where the artist broke down and wept.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you love Raphael and are trying to be a painter, don’t look just at the finished stuff, be sure to look at the sketches, which show all the effort that was required before perfection was anything like an option.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6035" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="study-raphael-drawing-sketch-head-two-third" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">Raphael, Head of Saint Catherine and sketches of cupids&#8217; (1507-8)</h6>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Buy a Korean moon jar</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s very lovely. But it’s far from perfect. There are patches where something has gone wrong with the colour. The glaze hasn’t worked terribly well. If you look carefully, you’ll see all kinds of dents and bumps in the shape.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6942" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z.jpg?resize=635%2C634" alt="16392250816_cfe9de7f84_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Flickr/Ashley Van Haeften</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The jar teaches us an important lesson: the imperfect can still be very good, noble and admirable. For something to be loved and valued, it really isn’t necessary for it to be perfect. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Contemplate Europa, the ice moon of jupiter</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Europa-moon.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6037" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Europa-moon.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="Europa-moon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p2">© NASA</h6>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Europa is equidistant from Manchester, Nairobi and Moscow (it’s about 628 million km from each of them); it has a crust of water ice; it may have a core of nickel. It orbits Jupiter every three and a half days. If you lived on Europa, you would have 104 times as many birthdays as you do on planet earth. Not much happens on Europa. In 2007, a NASA space probe came within about 2 million kilometres.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>From the point of view of Europa, the exact quality of the report you are writing, the ideal order of the financial presentation, the brilliance (or lack of it) of the marketing campaign… none of these look very urgent. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Investigate your worries exhaustively</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Perfectionism gives rise to worries. If I make a start, I’ll make a mistake and then something terrible will happen. Inside one’s head there are half-formed fears which run along lines such as: If I don’t get the presentation exactly right, I might as well not have done it at all. If I don’t write the ideal report I’ll never make partner. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Take the fears very seriously, write them down. Investigate how much truth there is in them. Is it in fact true that the only possible way to become a partner in the firm is always to write perfect reports? Will you in fact be sacked if the presentation is merely quite good and not brilliant?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Our minds are deeply irrational in the way they generate fears. Write down the litanies of terrors and then submit them to rational and benign scrutiny. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Of course we go to work for money and the people you meet can be great. But a lot of the time – though we might not quite put a finger on it exactly – we’re also looking for something else from our work: a sense of meaning.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we talk about jobs being meaningful or meaningless, we are at heart asking whether these jobs are helping anyone’s life to go better: we’re wondering whether our work stands a chance of increasing someone’s pleasure or reducing their suffering. Unlike what standard economics tells us, we’re desperate to make a significant contribution to the good. It’s hard to be happy at work without a sense that we’re helping others.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The worry that work is not meaningful tends to announce itself in one of five main ways:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. My job feels meaningless because the products are trivial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘My job’s OK day-to-day, it’s interesting managing quite a big team. But in the end we’re only making paper clips. Nothing wrong with that. We do it really well. You’d be surprised by the size of the market. But speaking personally it somehow feels a bit trivial: if all goes well, I will have helped someone to keep their papers in order. I’ve been here five years. I sometimes wonder if I’m wasting my life.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. My job feels meaningless because I’m a tiny cog in a huge machine</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I don’t want to complain. I’m glad to have a job. We’re in biotech and maybe for the guys at the top and the researchers it’s all very worthy. But I’m not doing that. I’m just dealing with pay dates and when people are on leave. I also have to make sure there’s toner in the printers on the 9th floor and that we’ve practiced the fire drill according to the regulations. It gets me down to think there’s all these amazing things going on in the company and I’m not really part of it.’</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my customers</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘I work front of house in a really smart restaurant – you’d know the chef from television – and there are lots of things to love. But frankly a lot of the customers put me off. It’s depressing sometimes: they’re bitchy, often thinking you’ve ripped them off – and never ever say thanks. And quite often there are couples out for a big meal who seem so nasty and spoilt.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my bosses</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘In theory, management consultancy can sound pretty interesting. But I reckon (and please don’t tell anyone this) the people I work for are pretty cynical. They’re smarmy-polite around the big clients but, the moment they’re back in the office, they’re hard as nails. They’re always, always going on about the bottom line, and the return on capital.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. My job feels meaningless because any difference we make happens so slowly</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The company I’m with is one of the biggest on the planet: we’re literally, on every continent. People think that’s an exaggeration but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I mean I think we actually do have something around the Antarctic, though I don’t know exactly what it’s to do with. The scale of projects is massive but the pace is horrifyingly slow. Sometimes you work developing something for ten years (I did on the geothermals of a proposed pipeline) but day-to-day, it’s just mind-numbing. Nothing feels like it’s ever changing or improving. It’s hard to have to look forward to 2021. Will I even be alive?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some jobs might really just be a bit meaningless: they really don’t contribute to the good; like advertising fake remedies for minor ailments, or working out how to get low-income people to gamble more, or developing financial products that benefit the seller more than the buyer. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a lot of jobs <em>feel</em> less meaningful than they really<em> are</em>. The work the person is doing does actually makes a real contribution to the good of humanity. Only the work doesn’t<em> feel</em> meaningful to that individual.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s our target here; and there are multiple solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>Solutions to the Sense of Work Meaninglessness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: My job feels meaningless because the products are trivial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Vermeerification</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many employees suffer from the feeling that their work is meaningless because, in their own eyes, what they do lacks glamour. Others, they think, are making components for rockets to go to Mars, but here they are figuring out how to make (marginal) improvements to the paper clip company’s tax position. In their view of the world, something else has glamour and what they’re involved in doesn’t.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But glamour is a remarkably variable quality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5979" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project-2.jpg?resize=635%2C575" alt="803px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_Het_melkmeisje_-_Google_Art_Project (2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Johannes Vermeer,</span><em><span class="s1"> The Milkmaid </span></em><span class="s1">(1657-8)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is one of the treasures of Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum. If it were ever on the market, the price tag would be astronomical. About five million people jostle for a place in front of it every year, in the belief they are admiring one of the great masterpieces of Western art. You could view it as an exercise in the crucial task of re-assigning glamour. When Vermeer painted it (probably around 1658), pouring milk was not a highly regarded occupation. But he saw things differently. The painting shows the dignity and honour that such a simple task had in his eyes. The activity, as described by the painter, is no longer lowly or trivial.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5980" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025-1.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In another work, <em>The Little Street</em>, Vermeer pushes the same thought further. The supposedly minor activities (scrubbing the tiles, darning a sock, sweeping the gutter in the yard) are in fact ways in which something very important is accomplished. Such acts bring order and grace to the physical environment. We have many needs. A clean floor is one of them. Keeping papers neat is another. Many different things in life have to be attended to for things to be okay overall, and each one is therefore connected up to the grander projects of existence. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3674965537_a242e05511_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6946" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3674965537_a242e05511_b.jpg?resize=635%2C599" alt="3674965537_a242e05511_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are companies that need to get artful, to unlock their employees’ appreciation of the real worth – and hence meaningfulness – of what they do. Vermeer himself is a voice from the past, saying something important in the terms that made most sense in his own day. We could do with some corporate Vermeers to bring the message up to date – and it might be paper clips, rather than jugs of milk that they focus on first. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: My job feels meaningless because I’m a tiny cog in a huge machine</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: The Novel</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some enemies of seeing ‘meaning’ that have arisen because of the sheer scale of businesses in modern capitalism. Corporations coordinate the labours of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of people – and raise productivity exponentially. But extreme specialisation and global reach can gravely reduce the sense of meaning that any one employee might have. A packaging supervisor in Malmo might not have much idea of how their work fits in with the activities of a geochemist in Ghana who compares activated alumina with indigenous laterite and bauxite as potential sorbents for removing fluoride from drinking water or with the concerns of a legal expert currently staying in the Alvear Hotel in Buenos Aires and reporting to a steering committee in New York about the implications of proposed revisions to Section 14 of the Argentine Mining Code. And yet all these individuals might be working for the same rather noble cause. Just none of them can quite remember day-to-day what the real cause actually is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems fiendish, trying to get people to see where they fit into the whole – and hence to feel how their work is meaningful. But in fact we have a lot of cultural experience around addressing similar kinds of problem. From the middle of the 19th century, novelists started experimenting with the idea of weaving multiple plot lines together. This reached its maturity around the late 1970s in the genre of the spy story.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/john-le-carre.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5982" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/john-le-carre.jpg?resize=635%2C559" alt="John Le Carre" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Le Carré, in the year he perfected the art of coordinating multiple plot lines</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, hypothetically, one chapter of a novel about a company might open with a description of someone accessing a bank account in Salzburg. The next thing, we’re in a restaurant in the Wan Chai District of Hong Kong where a deal is being hammered out to transfer packing crates to Dubai. Then the focus is on a meeting taking place in a basement in Whitehall concerning regulations for consumer goods. But rather than being a hopeless confusion, the point of the novel would eventually be to reveal how all of these apparently random events are in fact profoundly interconnected – and pointing to a rather grand goal. They are all manifestations of one intention: to create a new IT system for an office in Munich, say, or to increase the flow rate of a pump production line in southern Spain. Once scattered events are weaved together into a story, they can start to feel very meaningful indeed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, every large company needs to deploy the resources of narrative: they need their own version of the spy story to tie elements together and should, perhaps, have some novelists on their payroll. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my customers</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Intrinsic Value</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/display_image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/display_image.jpg?resize=635%2C642" alt="display_image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, <em>The Convalescent’s Meal (</em>1747) </span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all we know, the poorly individual whose lunch is being so devotedly-prepared is a crabby, opinionated husband. Or maybe they’re a very frustrated adolescent given to taking out their anger at being cooped up in bed on the only person around to dump it on. Or it’s maybe a rich employer with a painfully over-developed sense of entitlement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in Chardin’s eyes, it seems, none of this matters too much. The woman isn’t simply doing this for the other person. She’s shelling the hard boiled carefully because she likes to do things well. If there were a little bit of the shell left, she’d feel that wasn’t right. She loves the perfect, glistening shape; she’s absorbed in her work and focused on doing everything as well as she can, making sure everything is perfect. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s learned a vital trick. Even if the other person – the customer, in effect – doesn’t appreciate what she’s doing, she sees its worth. She’s doesn’t have to depend on the approval of another person to respect her own values and to want very ardently to live up to them. She likes things done a certain way, and doesn’t need a cheering gallery to support her. You can also tell her values from the well-polished little cup, the perfectly baked loaf of bread, and the neatness of her apron. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This strength of character can translate into commercial situations. The customers (perhaps it’s an airline or a hotel, a clothing chain or a spa) may be silent, preoccupied, undemonstrative or just rude. But they are turning up all the same; however imperfect their manners, they are actually paying. It’s the culture of the business that must compensate for their churlishness. It can adopt a Chardin-like perspective, which means setting the feeling of the worth of an activity free from the response of the customers. Self-respect takes the place of adulation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When hatred of customers threatens motivation, another avenue of progress lies in the direction of curiosity. It’s easy to hate customers. Those being served are often richer than those doing the serving. It can hence be hard for the person making the bed, or bringing the sole dauphinoise from the kitchen to the table, or fitting a pair of shoes that would cost a fortnight of their own wages, to feel much sense that they are contributing to the good of humanity by attending to these particular spoilt brats they are in charge of. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, though, we tend to know little of the lives of others. What we see on the surface might be wildly misleading. The boorish, apparently ungrateful tourist at the luxury hotel may have built their wealth through unremitting devotion for two and a half decades to providing used cars at the fairest prices to people in the south-western suburbs of Minneapolis. They’re maybe terrible at showing gratitude to a chambermaid or the concierge, but they’re truly excellent in many other (though currently invisible) ways, which you’d grasp very quickly if you met them in another context: looking for a reliable 2008 Dodge Stratus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the hotel, the restaurant or the shoe shop you’re seeing only a fraction of the individual. That fraction might not be too lovely. But it really isn’t a guide to the whole person. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: My job feels meaningless because I don’t respect my bosses</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: Upward Imagination</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to hate one’s boss. But the real challenge, which may also help one to regain motivation, is to try to imagine what it is like to be the boss.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WP3.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5984" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WP3.jpeg?resize=635%2C357" alt="WP3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">War and Peace</span></em><span class="s1">: The externals have changed, but the account of the mind of the boss is still useful</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of the problem comes down to the fact that our culture is a bit short on realistic, sensitive descriptions of bosses, and of people in positions of authority generally. A big exception, however, is Tolstoy’s <em>War and Peace</em>, first published in 1869. Tolstoy was hugely interested in what it’s like to be in charge. In the novel, the junior characters are always going on about how stupid the people in power are. A lot of blame circulates. Then Tolstoy takes us into the some of the grim decision-making situations that people in power actually face. It’s 1812, Napoleon’s armies have swept through Russia, they’re within striking distance of Moscow. It’s unthinkable, surely, that the enemy should take that city, the emotional heartland of the nation. The commander of the army – Kutuzov – has to decide whether to preserve the army or preserve the city. He makes a swift, brutal and totally right decision. Save the army. Kutuzov isn’t very nice in the standard ways. Tolstoy is careful to let us see this. But he attains a certain dignity nevertheless, once you can see that he stands in a terrifying place and has to face some very big, fearful issues, as many bosses do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Often enough, the feeling that it’s meaningless to work for someone results from a misunderstanding as to why they act as they do: why they are short-tempered, in a hurry, preoccupied, gloomy and tricky to be around. Each company needs its own local version of Tolstoy who can more sympathetically take the employees into the mind of the boss, so that motivation is not lost through sheer incomprehension of what life might be like through someone else’s eyes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: My job is meaningless because any difference happens so slowly</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Solution: The Lessons of History </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People want to feel that they are progressing the world. That’s understandable. But quite often, in fact, what they are doing is indeed contributing to the betterment of the world. It’s just going to take a very very long time. Day-to-day, it won’t feel like much progress is being made – and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>yet it is, just bit by bit, extremely slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_28th_July_1830_-_WGA6177.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5985" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_28th_July_1830_-_WGA6177.jpg?resize=635%2C523" alt="Eugène_Delacroix_-_Liberty_Leading_the_People_(28th_July_1830)_-_WGA6177" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Such images feed a sense of frustrated impatience – and hence make work feel less meaningful than it is</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1830, the French painter Eugene Delacroix produced an amazing image of radical action: the good guys storm forwards, the enemies of progress are swept aside (some of them die), the new world is being born. Sunlight breaks through the clouds. This is the extreme version of a dominant idea of what it means to change stuff: namely, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>you’ll feel the difference right now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunately – though it’s a great painting – it’s also emotional propaganda for a very misleading vision of how good change actually comes about. It makes us more impatient than we should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we look on a big scale, it’s obvious that the world changes – and frequently improves. But this is only apparent when the time frame is sufficiently wide. Year by year, it might seem as if nothing is going right or that things are actually going backwards. This is the problem faced by politicians, the medical community and many companies too: they are doing good, but those who depend on them can’t see the change in a sufficiently speedy and hence meaning-laden way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9488_1353212751_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5986" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/9488_1353212751_3.jpg?resize=635%2C463" alt="9488_1353212751_3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A reminder that progress is slow, messy, imperfect – and real</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1848, the historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, published a <em>History of England</em>, surveying the events of the previous century and a half. He came, eventually, to the reassuring conclusion that ‘The history of the United Kingdom during the last hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of moral, and of intellectual improvement.’ He wasn’t in the least ignoring the facts that in that time there had been two major rebellions in 1715 and 1745, a disastrous (from the English point of view) conflict with the US, a long and terrifying war with Napoleon, major religious riots and a transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy that had exacted an appalling human cost. All he meant was that despite these grave matters, genuine progress had been made. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a theory of good development that teaches us an important lesson in patience. And also in gradual accumulation. The big benefits to a nation (and by implication a company or individual) may not come about via any single grand event, like the storming of the Bastille. In England’s history, there was a piece of legislation here, an improvement in productivity there, a school was built in Chester, a road was resurfaced in Northumberland, pipes were laid to improve the water supply in Plymouth: thousands of individually relatively minor activities connected together over time gradually added up to momentous transformation. But on the ground at any particular moment it probably wouldn’t have felt as if much real progress was being made. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What Macaulay did was to trace the benefits of cumulative effect. It’s a crucial move that all companies should learn from if they wish to keep their more impatient and Romantic employees on board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Typically management might see the ‘meaning’ of any particular job in terms of its contribution to the overall financial success of the company. That, after all, is ultimately how the position is justified and why it is worth employing someone to do it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this rationale does not connect with the human experience of meaning. Hardly anyone can find their work meaningful because it secures a marginally superior rate of return on capital to the shareholders than they could obtain from a rival investment. It is indeed essential to a corporation to achieve this, otherwise they will eventually go out of business, but the financial success of a company is always quite distant from the concerns of the average employee. It happens somewhere very far away. Of course, theoretically they know perfectly well that their work depends on the economic health of the enterprise. Only it’s not a big personal motive. It’s in the day-to-day experience that a job feels meaningful – or not. And this is a huge matter. Because the sense of meaning is one of the things that determines the greatest issue of all: how hard and well people will work.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In certain companies and offices around the world, there is a crisis of motivation. You know the sort of thing: in a brainstorming session, a key member of the team tunes out. They have a half-formed suggestion, which might actually be very interesting, but they don’t push themselves and let it drop. In another department, there’s an employee who seems to be sick quite often; they’re within their rights and there’s always a valid medical reason, but the manager knows that, in truth, a more devoted worker would be coming in. Across the organisation, there’s a culture of living for the weekend. It seems everyone might be a little on the look-out to leave – if only they can get a better offer. People check LinkedIn a lot. A really great guy went to a rival firm last month.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5959" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="5380585665_72842b37ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are a number of reasons why workers lose motivation, but a central one, one of the most important, comes down to the feeling of not being valued. Gratitude might sound like a small thing, a little add-on with no seismic role to play in the fortunes of companies, but its absence in sufficient doses between layers of the managers and the managed can be responsible for extreme declines in productivity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people don’t feel valued they stop putting forward their best efforts. They won’t rack their brains for a slightly better solution or neater deal. At parties, they take revenge: they enjoy spreading unattractive gossip about the firm. These things cost – a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Conversely, there are enormous gains in productivity to be found when people do feel that their work and contribution are being truly appreciated. In <em>The Oath of the Horatii</em>, the 18th century French painter David, captures the energy of loyalty based on love.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The three brothers vow to give their lives – if need be – to save the city of ancient Rome, because they know their father (who holds the swords in the middle of the picture) wants them to – and they love and revere him. It’s amazing what people will do, if they really like you and want to deserve your gratitude. It’s what bosses often don’t understand; they’ve noticed how fear can get people moving. They’ve not yet grasped how much further and faster gratitude can drive us.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Leander swims over the Hellespont to meet his mistress Hero</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ancient world was captivated by the story of Leander. He was so devoted to his confusingly-named girlfriend, Hero, that he used to swim a couple of miles each night across the choppy waters of the Hellespont – now more familiar as the Dardanelles – to be with her. The myth has a tragic end: one night Leander is caught up in a storm and drowns. But his strenuous efforts to be with the one he loves speaks of the commanding power of devotion: we will push ourselves intensely in the service of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tantalising to think how such potential could be harnessed in other areas of life. Every evening, Hero would light a lamp on her side of the straits to guide Leander. Might there be equivalents, other ‘lamps’ in the world of work, that could lead and spur the imagination?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The failure to offer gratitude (and therefore a root cause of the loss of motivation) can be traced back to a number of false beliefs in the minds of management. Here are just a few:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. ‘Money should be enough’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The standard view is that what makes a person feel valued is the size of their salary. This is of course (confusingly) partly true, but we know in other areas of life that money only goes so far. While money – or gifts – are always welcome, we generally badly want to be valued in many other ways as well. The very notion that <em>simply</em> paying people ought to be enough has a habit of making them feel insulted, <em>not</em> valued, for it suggests that one only considers them as cash-maximising creatures, which is – </span>in its own way – a slur.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’d only imagine that someone’s good will could be bought<em> purely</em> for cash if you weren’t really interested in them. We grasp this point intuitively in families. A father who buys his child lots of expensive gifts, but doesn’t otherwise interact with them very much, isn’t building a strong relationship with them. In later years, the neglected party will say things like: ‘Dad was never around; he bought me a bike – it was a great bike, cost a fortune – but he never taught me to ride. He wasn’t there when I fell off, he never saw me do a wheelie down Glenorchy Avenue. I suppose in his way he loved me, but I didn’t feel it. We hardly talk now.’ The insult lies in the father’s assumption that the bike (and lots of other gifts) could be enough. He didn’t acknowledge how much else a child would need from him.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can sound weird to say that employees might need to offer love. But it’s a theory we’ve been rehearsing in relation to children for at least half a century. This photo of David Cameron walking his daughter Florence to school in London show how far we’ve come – at least in relation to parenting – in grasping how important quality of attention is. Prior to the 21st century, such scenes would have been unthinkable. An image of the most powerful person in the country clutching a doll would have been (in 1873 or 1961) enough to swamp a career in ridicule. There was simply, until recently, no recognition of why this might be a really good thing to do. A father with a big job would have felt that in <em>paying </em> for everything, he was doing all that was necessary. ‘I’m paying the school fees, the doctor&#8217;s bill, for the house and the holiday. Why should I pick up their doll?’ he might say. But today, we understand that Cameron is doing the school run because he knows that it is very significant for Florence to see that as well as being a grown-up, he’s fully alive to her world and her needs. The doll is important to her and so it’s important to him too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to understand that in order to help children develop well, we need to be sweet and understanding, patient and playful. We’re alive to how much of a difference this makes. The child who has been met with loving kindness will, we know, develop very differently than if they had always been treated sternly, constantly upbraided and criticised. In parenting we’ve learned to see the extraordinary potential unlocked in a person by love. The rare adult who now thinks this is a load of sentimental nonsense isn’t admired for their focus on practicality; they are regarded as dangerously out of touch with the smart reality of how one gets children to turn out reasonably well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A comparable revolution awaits in business. What we’ve learned in parenting hasn’t yet been properly absorbed in commercial life. It can still feel as if toughness is a mark of practical efficiency and that to deploy emotional intelligence is an unhelpful luxury. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. ‘Fear is better than Love when managing people’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s an old debate, dating back at least to Ancient Rome, about whether it is better to govern with love or with fear. Notice the either/or structure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evidently, there are many occasions where it’s necessary to be dissatisfied with the work or efforts of particular people. Not being grateful can be a productive way of signalling that something isn’t good enough yet. If we were permanently grateful, nothing could get better. Too much praise – that is, praise given too quickly or accorded too easily makes a person think that they’re good enough when they’re not. That isn’t kind either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Niccolò Machiavelli, a Florentine bureaucrat and author of <em>The Prince</em> (1513) is the man who comes to mind at such moments. He rigorously argued for a dark truth: that people are by nature lazy and cowardly, and that in order to be an effective leader, one should be feared rather than loved. Only terror works.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5963" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito.jpg?resize=635%2C622" alt="Portrait_of_Niccolò_Machiavelli_by_Santi_di_Tito" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Santi di Tito,</span><em><span class="s1"> Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli</span></em></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there’s a strain of devil’s-advocacy in this thinking that is in danger of blinding us to an obvious, but often neglected, truth: that there’s a clear need to play two cards: the card of love and the card of fear. Discussing the importance of the love card – gratitude, appreciation, niceness – doesn’t entail that the fear card is irrelevant, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many managers fail to hold on to the nuance, as if the choice were about being either always nice or permanently in tough mode. The trick is to develop a style of love that is driven by values; a love that is properly and appropriately <strong><em>conditional</em></strong>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Western culture, we distinguish between two ways of thinking about love. Firstly, there’s <strong>unconditional</strong> love, best exemplified by Jesus’s parable of the prodigal son.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5964" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg?resize=635%2C555" alt="785px-Rembrandt_Harmensz_van_Rijn_-_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Rembrandt van Rijn,<em> Return of the Prodigal Son </em></h6>
<p class="p1">The son has been a complete wastrel. He took his father’s cash, ran off and spent the lot on wine, women and song. He ended up with a terrible job. Then he decided to head back home. What does his father do? Greets him with open arms and ‘kills the fatted calf’ (the story is told in Luke’s Gospel 15:29–30) to illustrate the idea of unconditional love: &#8216;it doesn’t matter what you do, how far you stray, I will always love you and be here for you&#8217;. It’s something that parents do at times feel for their children. It can be an immensely moving idea. But understandably one might be very sceptical of its relevance to business. It’s almost exactly what one can’t have. A business does not exist anywhere on earth that might say: ‘So, you blew that account, the contract you designed was a disaster for the firm, you did the opposite of what you were asked to do and we lost that client: but come home, we love you just the same&#8230;’</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are, fortunately, other, more useful theories of love around. The one we should look to is called <em><strong>philosophical</strong></em>  because it was first defined by the Greek philosopher Plato. This idea is that love, properly understood, must be conditional. It says: ‘Love is admiration for what is good. It is not, and can never be, personal. It is related to qualities and actions. I will therefore love you if you are good, but only if you are good’. In this view, love is closely connected to admiration. You love what’s worthy in another person – and therefore you are disappointed when they don’t live up to their capacities. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The choice doesn’t have to be between Machiavellian fear and Christian love. The answer lies in holding to a conditional, philosophical theory of love: a love that adequately identifies and then rewards the good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. ‘I don’t have time to be grateful’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another major reason people aren’t more grateful is a fear of how long it might take to be grateful – and an anxiety about what sort of relationship and expectations might be built up if one were, on occasion, to be a little more relaxed. Gratitude can seem painfully at odds with getting things done. A manager might worry that by showing gratitude, they’ll become a chum, rather than the boss. It might feel nice for a little while, but then there’ll come a point when they need to crack the whip and they’ll find it doesn’t work anymore: ‘If I’m grateful I’ll be entering a sticky relationship – I’ll be invited to their cousin’s wedding and then have to find a way of refusing politely. If I ask about the child once, I’ll have to ask every time. That might end up being three hours, accumulated over a year.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We normally experience kindness as meaning a commitment to someone for a long time. A related point can be seen in the history of philosophy. It’s tempting to think that a serious idea needs a very long book. But, actually, that’s not true. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Think of the French philosopher, La Rochefoucauld (born in Paris in 1613), who wrote a very slim book, barely 60 pages long, that can deservedly be counted as one of the true masterpieces of philosophy. It’s a compendium of acerbic, melancholy observations about the human condition, each of them only a sentence or two long: ‘We all have strength enough to bear the misfortunes of others.’ ‘Some people would never have fallen in love if they hadn’t heard there was such a thing&#8230;’ etc. These gems say in a sentence what others have needed whole books for. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This matters because there are related techniques for social brevity. At the heart of good social brevity is psychological accuracy. Brevity is fine (it doesn’t feel brusque or dismissive) when appreciation is accurate; just as La Rochefoucauld’s observations don’t feel flimsy just on the basis of their length. A good compliment latches on to the true goodness of a person or the worth of their effort. The key to brevity is accurate insight. You have to get used to asking yourself about the actual roots of your satisfaction with what someone has done. What is it, in fact, that especially deserves appreciation? You don’t need to go to the pub and spend an hour and a half to convey gratitude convincingly. You need to think hard and fast – and deliver a big-hearted compliment with the rapier-like deftness of a great French aphorist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. ‘I’m too worried to stop and pay compliments’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is often at the root cause of a lack of gratitude. By definition, a manager is frequently overseeing a wide range of tasks. The individual worker is only doing one bit of a picture whose full expanse they might not be able to see. To the worker, their own effort is a big thing. To the manager, it’s a small thing in relation to the big picture of the needs of the organisation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DT1995.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5967" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/DT1995.jpg?resize=635%2C518" alt="DT1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Marie-Guillemine Benoist,</span><em><span class="s1"> Madame Philippe Panon Desbassayns de Richemont and Her Son Eugene</span></em><span class="s1"> (1802)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We get this intuitively when it comes to parents and children. The parent has to worry about so many things that the child can’t begin to grasp but which are hugely relevant to the child’s well being (it’s one of the things that makes pictures of mothers and children so poignant). The parent needs to keep their mind on issues like: How will I ensure my child gets a good education? What if there’s a banking collapse and we lose our savings? Can we actually afford to stay in the house we’re in or should we be cutting back and moving somewhere more affordable? What if the political situation worsens, will we need to leave the country? And yet all the child is focused on is: does anyone here like my drawing? Isn’t it amazing I did well in the geography test? I don’t want to write thank you letters!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In business there is necessarily some version of this. The manager inevitably has an eye on the bigger picture in a way that can’t normally be the case for most employees. This means that often they feel simply too burdened to have much emotional bandwidth left over to consider generously the needs and achievements of others. It’s totally understandable. But truly magnanimous people manage to keep their own (perhaps very serious) worries at bay for long enough to be gracious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An instance of this can be found – perhaps unexpectedly – in the life of Margaret Thatcher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_Iron_Lady_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5968" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_Iron_Lady_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition.jpg?resize=635%2C544" alt="708px-Sand_Painting_of_Mrs._Thatcher_the_'Iron_Lady'_incorporating_magnetised_iron_filings_in_the_composition" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not necessary to be sympathetic politically to Mrs Thatcher to admire her ability to bracket anxiety</span></p>
<p class="p1">In 1979, not long after she had become Prime Minister, she was hosting a dinner at Chequers, her official country house, when a hapless waitress managed to drop a bowl of soup into the lap of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Everyone must have been expecting the forceful, driven, perfectionist Prime Minister to turn furiously on the mortified waitress. But instead, Mrs Thatcher jumped up to console the distraught young woman: ‘There, there,’ she said, ‘you musn’t be upset’. From the height of power, she entered for a moment into the the reality of what this mishap must have meant in the life of someone vulnerable and of no consequence in the public life of the nation.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a crucial capacity at work, here: the ability to bracket anxiety. Obviously, Mrs. Thatcher had a thousand major concerns on her mind: she was trying to reform industrial relations, control inflation, increase GDP, fight off critics in her own party (to commence the list). In such a situation, anyone could have been forgiven for blowing their top, as most of us often do (you are harassed at work and some clown goes and sets off the fire alarm by mistake. You want to have them hung drawn and quartered). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ungrateful-seeming person is at heart, often just a very worried person. They don’t feel they’ve got enough time to pause and enter into someone else’s life. They can’t afford to be nice. The fact is though that, really, they – and we – all do&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. I don’t see that there’s anything in particular to be grateful for…’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s extremely easy to lose sight of the pains – and indeed the efforts – of others. We see this most clearly in the way we respond to information in the news media. It’s incredibly easy for the lives of other people to disappear into abstractions. For example, theoretically, we know quite well that there is something called poverty in China. And we realise that many children in all countries have hard lives. But, if we’re honest, we have to admit that mostly we’re not moved by these abstract facts. We don’t really take it in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why this thing we call ‘art’ can be especially helpful. Art can take us into the experience of other people and transform a statistic into something that moves us. Take these photographs of one poor single father’s struggle to bring up his young son in Wenzhou, China.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yuan Zhouming makes a meagre living polishing people’s shoes twelve hours a day on the streets of Wenzhou, a large city in south-east China. His wife ran off a few years ago, so he takes his four-year-old son around with him while he’s working. The little boy used to beg for food, dart into the road, and sometimes try to steal things from passers by. So the father has taken to tethering him with a rope to keep him out of mischief. He lives his childhood on a tiny patch of pavement. It’s not cruelty, it’s desperation. The father just can’t do his job and keep an eye on Yuan Wang at the same time. At night, they go home to a single squalid basement room. The boy has a teddy bear – his one comfort.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lesson that can be drawn from this has applications (though usually of a less dramatic kind) in business. Everyday we’re side by side with people, but we encounter only very particular aspects of who they are. They get simplified into a few basic facts: ‘the girl who lives in Croydon with nice hair who put me down in a meeting last week’ or ‘the guy from sales with funny ears’. The bigger truths about who they are remain hidden: the patience with a troubled younger brother, the still-broken heart from a relationship that capsized four months ago; the prized collection of copper saucepans; the way they are haunted by memory of evenings on Playa Ancha beach and the sun going down over Valparaiso Bay. </span></p>
<p class="p1">These aren&#8217;t minor matters, because getting the best out of a person requires understanding what can move them, inspire them, touch their ambitions and imagination. Being appreciated as the person one really is is a huge matter.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                                ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what can we do? Gratitude – like a sense of humour – isn’t something we normally think about <em>learning</em> in a systematic deliberate way. We’d more likely imagine it as just something some people have a knack for and others don’t. But in fact, as we’re coming to see, skills in this area are not simply a matter of luck. They depend on an unfamiliar muscle, which it might at first feel quite odd to flex deliberately, but which we should take care to exercise on a regular basis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To start to develop this gratitude muscle, we might begin quite far away from the usual concerns of business. We can tap into an elemental idea of gratitude, first developed by a 17th-century Japanese Buddhist monk and poet called Matsuo Bashō. Bashō was interested in teaching his followers how to nurture their capacity to appreciate everything around them. There are times when, under the influence of certain pieces of poetry or works of art, one may leave one’s ego and anxieties behind, and look at oneself and others from a very unusual perspective: as if one was not oneself. One can float free of concerns and start to identify with things which we normally pay little attention to. One starts to notice the breeze, the softness of the grass underfoot, moisture in the air, one’s own breath, the sound of a bell ringing far away, a bird on a tree through the window… One can become in the imagination a rock, water, the stars, leading one to an enlightened frame of mind known as <em>muga</em>, or a loss-of-awareness-of-oneself.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">&#8216;Hibiscus with Haiku&#8217;</span></em><span class="s1"> by Bashō</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bashō’s aim wasn’t just to liberate us from the burden of being ourselves: it was to initiate a distinctive state of mind where gratitude would be easier, as would kindness and empathy. Thanks to this distinctive spiritual practice, one might end up feeling grateful for often unnoticed things like: rain, trees, clouds, a bowl of rice or a helpful hand from a colleague.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These moments of heightened appreciation reveal – if nothing else – that our ‘gratitude meter’ is quite a variable instrument that we tone down and up. Sometimes we may feel gratitude for the existence of a small plant; at other times we’re hugely irritated by sporadic wifi coverage while touring Dartmouth National Park. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting better at appreciating things which we tend to take for granted is one of the big themes of art.</span></p>

<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1">Adriaen Coorte,</span><em><span class="s1"> Strawberries </span></em><span class="s1">(1696)</span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In theory, we already think that strawberries are nice. But the Dutch 17th-century artist Adriaen Coorte has made a monument to them. He wants to resensitise us to their extraordinary beauty. He’s reminding us that we love an aspect of the world more than we thought, and that there are things we took for granted. He’s looking at strawberries like an appreciative extra-terrestrial, re-finding a sense of wonder and encouraging us to do the same. The artist knows something crucial about us: how familiarity dulls our appreciation of what is on offer. By inviting us to concentrate just for a minute or two he can refresh our curiosity about, and engagement with, life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to do with many other things what Adriaen Coorte did with strawberries. Starting with some of our colleagues. In the spirit of Coorte and Bashō, we might try out a few Gratitude Muscle Exercises: we could begin by trying to imagine a day in the life of an office chair. Then, setting aside our preoccupation with ourselves, we could try to describe a day as it might seem through the eyes of a colleague (no names needed) that we don’t like very much: we’d imagine what it might be like to be them brushing their teeth or, on the way to the bus stop, speaking to their mother on the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                             ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In essence, gratitude is hugely important but currently lacks prestige. People say: ‘I don’t have time to write the report or go to the meeting’. They never say: ‘I don’t have time to sit and chat with my workers, or to make them feel appreciated’. That’s because we have a picture of how a report and meeting contribute to the overall economic performance of a business but, as yet, we don’t properly recognise the role gratitude can play in the success of a company. We don’t see it as the key that unlocks motivation and great performance. Getting gratitude right deserves to be recognised as one of the great arts of management, something that might just get people to swim the Hellespont for you.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karen Lloyd died recently at 51 from cancer. She liked drinking coffee so much her family decided to commission a coffin for her with the name of her favourite chain on the side.</p>
<p>It was a moving, sweetly eccentric gesture. We don’t typically think of corporations as claiming or deserving that kind of place in our lives. Karen’s loyalty, even love, for a brand is extremely unusual.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5946" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinA.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="PM-210214-coffinA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Mostly, we just tolerate the companies who provide the fabric of our lives: phones and shoes, flights, groceries, insurance, trousers, electricity. One might be a bit better than another, offer attractive deals or provide decent service. But this is miles away from deep admiration or love.</p>
<p>We’ve come to think that that’s exactly how things should be. It’s normal to think that if you’re keeping your wits about you, you should be a touch cynical about and detached from the corporate world. Which is why Karen’s funeral has come to wider attention.</p>
<p>Companies sometimes like to talk in terms of love and big missions; but they never quite convince us when they do. It’s easy to satirise their efforts. The slogans are neat (‘We try harder’, ‘Just do it’, ‘I’m lovin’ it…’), but we’re all world-weary enough to shrug our shoulders and walk past with wry disregard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now, most corporations don’t deserve our deep admiration – and they don’t get it either. But at various times, we can catch glimpses of how it could be very different. In 1895, it wouldn’t have been at all strange for a station master to get married in his Great Western Railway uniform. Not because he was slavish. But because the ideals of the transport company resonated so deeply with his own better nature. The company’s devotion to service and reliability, the grandeur of its big stations, the sense of dignity in its pension schemes – these were things someone could take to heart and feel justifiably proud to be part of.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5947" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PM-210214-coffinC.jpg?resize=635%2C480" alt="PM-210214-coffinC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Corporate love: it would not have been strange for employees of the Great Western Railway to make a wedding suit of their uniform</h5>
<p>There is a great deal of large-scale ambition in the world, but all the largest corporate entities are focused on servicing basic needs: the mechanics of communication, inexpensive things to eat, energy so we can move about. While our higher needs &#8211; for love, beauty, wisdom &#8211; have no comparable provision. The drive to grandeur is missing just where we need it most.  There are times when the role of grandeur in economic life is recognisable. The employees of the Great Western Railways did not see themselves as merely having a job, required to switch the points, shovel coal or sell tickets. They understood themselves to be participants in a noble enterprise. The details of their own labour &#8211; however minor they might seem &#8211; were like the details in a great work of art, necessary contributions to a magnificent whole. It was by doing efficiently and conscientiously what they did that the great collective effects could be produced &#8211; that a fast, comfortable train could thunder through tunnels and speed across viaducts; that all the immense complexity of the machines could fire the imagination of the public. The directors of the business realised that transport could be more than just a way of getting from one place to another &#8211; one could be as a passenger strangely awestruck and moved by the beauty of the mechanisms. And they deliberately cultivated a proud sense of participation in their employees. This was not a fiction. They were not cynically pretending, so as to dupe their workers into working harder.</p>
<p>Although located in the past, this model is important for the future. It should be much more widely possible to feel proud of the enterprise one works for, to feel that the efforts one makes are in the service of something genuinely good. That is, it should be possible to sense the grandeur of the task. The experience of grandeur does not merely provide a transient feeling of elevation, it helps us internalise an outlook which we need in order to rise to some of the key individual and collective challenges of life. It counteracts our natural preference for the immediate, the piecemeal and muddling through.</p>
<p>Devotion to grandeur can be a crucial element in admirable practical achievement. Take for instance the impressive expansion of the city of Edinburgh over a period of over a hundred years &#8211; from the 1760’s to the end of the 19th century. At the start of this Edinburgh was a cramped, decaying, festering town famous for its dirty streets. By the end it was one of the most beautiful and coherent places on the planet.</p>
<p>This transformation was the led by the Town Council. They did not just think in terms of increased housing, wider, more convenient streets, the opportunities for commerce, although all of these concerns were significant. They explicitly set out to construct the finest, most beautiful, city on earth; they really believed they could do this, and such a belief was crucial at every stage. They deliberately considered the greatest achievements of the past: the public architecture Athens was self-consciously invoked as setting the standard. They wanted to be the “Athens of the North’ &#8211; that is to take their provincial capital city, with all its defects, and create something that would equal the best that the history of the world had yet shown. This could easily sound presumptuous, vain, narcissistic, impossible &#8211; but the elegance and harmony of the squares and crescents they laid out and the beauty of the public buildings they commissioned, actually live up to the high ambition they set themselves.</p>
<p>Although the council took the initiative, they could have achieved little without widespread sympathy, trust, and shared excitement. In order to turn their plans into reality there needed to be many fellow travellers, who would want to buy houses in the new streets, who would honour and admire the councillors for their ambitions and who would keep the process going in the same direction for several generations. Grandeur was a collective, social virtue, not only the special possession of a few isolated leaders.</p>
<p>Living and dying under the banner of Costa is an endearingly quirky thing to do. And yet, perhaps one day in the future, that kind of devotion could be more than quirky. We could actually be proud to do something like this.</p>
<p>What would it take for corporations to be worth a coffin or wedding suit? They’d have to engage our better selves, do proper good in the world and help us to become who we want to be. Given how much of our lives we give to our work, these sound like highly necessary and not unrealistic ambitions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting people to work hard and do their best – to be highly motivated – is a central problem not only of individual businesses but of the economy as a whole. Everyone can recognise in themselves what a huge difference being fired-up makes: you confront challenges with energy, you sail through routine tasks, you stay calm under pressure, you come up with solutions to problems. If only we could unlock this kind of attitude in ourselves, we would, more widely, produce a much higher productivity and a flourishing economy.</p>
<p>There are lots of ideas in circulation about how to enhance motivation: it might help if an office or workplace is light, airy and pleasant; has a pizza day once a month; makes space for a table-tennis table. But such suggestions only hover around the edges. The overwhelmingly dominant current belief is that the best way to get people motivated is by giving them financial threats and inducements. Higher financial rewards are taken to be the essential way by which you attract and keep talent.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456486250.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5397" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456486250.jpg?resize=635%2C387" alt="Volkswagen : Press Preview Prior The 'Mondial De L'Automobile' - Paris Motorshow 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This theory was applied on a massive scale, in the later part of the twentieth century. A great many state-owned enterprises – railways, car manufacturing companies, power-stations &#8211; were seen to be failing. They were not efficient or profitable. Privatisation was conceived as a way of using a financial carrot and stick mechanism to reform them. If successful, the management could now expect very much higher salaries. And – on the other side – competitive failure would be punished by the market. The company could go bust, and everyone would lose their jobs – rather than being eternally supported by a forgiving and generous government.</p>
<p>Fear and reward around money, administered by the free market, were seen as the crucial factors that would transform motivation and turn lacklustre companies into commercial dynamos. This approach has worked its way deep into our vision of motivation. If a company wants to hire the most impressive graduates, it must offer the highest entry salaries. It’s summed up in the supposed common sense truth that if you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.</p>
<p>Still, companies continually struggle with motivation. Their employees don’t seem to care about the work itself: they gossip and chatter; they feel bored; they get tired easily; their minds are mostly half on something else; they don’t come in each day eager to overcome problems; they do the minimum they can get away with; they are always dreaming of days off and holidays; they live for the weekend. They seem to get sick a lot – and leave regularly. They want promotion, not because they really would be good at shouldering extra responsibility, but because it’s the way to get more money. Organisations are constantly playing around with the levers of financial motivation; offering or withholding money as an inducement or a threat. They use individual and team bonuses, cash rewards, profit sharing and company stock as ways of using economic factors to enhance motivation.</p>
<p>But there are some very striking examples of motivation outside this system. The military is a central case. In the armed forces – often for very modest pay – people will do extraordinary things. Even die. It’s an astonishing contrast. You can pay someone £18,000 a year to die for you. But you struggle to pay someone £22,000 a year to sit in a room and fill in forms.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459937168.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5405" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459937168.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="NETHERLANDS-ROYAL-MILITARY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This tells us that motivation simply cannot be primarily financial. People can be moved by money. But they can be moved and motivated much more by other things. The armed forces also tell us something about where the strongest kinds of motivation come from.</p>
<p>In the army, the soldier doesn’t just think they are serving their own interests; they see themselves as serving the best interests of their nation. They believe that what they are doing is right and deeply important. The intensity of their motivation is tied to their conviction of the great value of what they are involved in. It isn’t for money that they are ready to suffer hardship and expose themselves to grave danger; it’s for their country’s honour or to protect the people they love. Here, motivation is the result of the individual operating with a visceral sense of furthering a part of what one might call ‘the Good’, through their work. The soldier needs to get paid (how else can they live?) but it’s not the money that’s got the emotional pulling power.</p>
<p>‘The Good’ isn’t a phrase we tend to use everyday; and it’s entirely understandable that we’ve become a bit nervous around it. But ‘the Good’ makes perfect intuitive sense: it’s the satisfaction of the highest needs of mankind. It’s all the things that are felt to be in accordance with an ideal of human flourishing and the better self – what the Greek Philosophers called <em>eudaimonia</em>. It includes, though isn’t limited to, nursing, protecting, delighting, sheltering, teaching and enabling others. Though capitalism tends to describe humans as primarily financially-driven, self-maximising creatures, there is an important extent to which we are in fact driven to serve other people – and gain our greatest thrills from doing so.</p>
<p>Obviously people disagree about what exactly constitutes the best way to serve others. But the search isn’t for a single thing that could motivate everyone in the world. What companies need to find is an account of authentic serving that they can believe in and which they want to get employees to share.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461446556.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5401" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461446556.jpg?resize=635%2C447" alt="President Obama Welcomes NBA Champion San Antonio Spurs To White House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The more the worker feels they are contributing to the Good, the less there is a problem of motivation. They see their work as being something important; they want to do it right. They believe deeply that it needs to be done and they feel proud of their role (however modest) in making it happen. Money is a vital active ingredient here. But it’s the worth of the undertaking that moves people. And if an organisation can convincingly present itself as serving the Good, there’s less need to use the instrument of money as the primary source of motivation (either through punishment or reward).</p>
<p>So, for organisations, there’s a central challenge around articulating their mission so as to tap into the deeper roots of human motivation. Can they lay claim to our stronger motives – by orienting themselves towards serving an aspect of the Good and explaining this internally and to the world?</p>
<p>For some organisations, this is going to be a very testing exercise: because it will show up just how far they currently are from having any purpose that could truly motivate people: how far they are from doing something properly worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are plenty of organisations that serve the Good directly – even if they don’t entirely live up to this task – like schools and hospitals. But what about a company that manufactures and supplies paper clips? Are they connected to the Good? The explicit service they provide is very modest: preventing sheaves of loose paper getting muddled. But the human territory in which it operates is large: the longing to bring and maintain purposeful order. It is the same end that is served, with greater public recognition, by libraries, museums, maps, statistics and logic. The makers of paperclips make a small but significant contribution to the noble cause of Order in human life.</p>
<p>Society is often rather snobbish in this regard. It will bestow glamour on brain surgeons, but neglect the humbler work of the nurse. It will be impressed by fighter pilots, but not so much by traffic wardens. And yet the so-called ‘lesser’ activities are always connected up with the higher ones. It merely takes a more generous, imaginative, even artistic eye to spot the link.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5400" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025.jpg?resize=635%2C781" alt="732px-Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_025" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Vermeer’s <em>Little Street</em>, shows people involved in activities which then, as now, were generally regarded as pretty humble. Sweeping the yard, darning a sock, scrubbing the tiles. And we can imagine people often not being terribly motivated. Vermeer must have overheard all the familiar complaints: ‘What’s the point. I’m only going to have to do it all again tomorrow. No one notices much. It’s so tedious.’ But his aim, remarkable and very necessary in all eras, is to return true glamour to these little tasks: in themselves they may be minor. But they enact something major. They are the details out of which a deeply impressive and attractive civic life is created.</p>
<p>Vermeer is showing how you reconnect members of the workforce with the higher Good that they are in fact serving. He shows them (and us) the beauty of what they are doing in keeping a house tidy. He reminds them of the wonderful whole of which they are parts. The picture is an ideal motivator, because it makes the worker see the dignity and value of what they do. It’s reminding them why they want to be part of this. And so the role of money in motivation takes a slightly back seat.</p>
<p>The artist Vermeer is defining a central task of management, which is to ensure that the part of the Good in which the company is operating becomes as visible as possible. In the army and other top performing organisations, the Good is visible without too much work needing to be done. One can just tell that brain surgery and civil defence are important. Also, in many, daily ways the ultimate point of the organisation is restated and reaffirmed. So in the army there are, unabashedly, songs and flags, rituals, medals and ceremonies which are designed to keep at the front of every individual’s mind just exactly what this organisation is for. The relevance (and therefore the worth) of every task can be explained. If someone asks why they have to polish their shoes so much there’s an answer: it’s an exercise in discipline. Or if they ask why do they have to go for long runs on hot days: so as to prepare for conditions in conflict zones. The point of using the Army as a model here isn’t particularly to single them out for praise in terms of what they are for. It’s to point up the organisational advantages of an institution seeing itself as having a clear and important relationship to the Good.</p>

<p>Let’s move into the civilian sector. The Swiss Federal Railways has framed their relatively unexciting task of moving people in rectangular boxes from one place to another in the Helvetic Republic via another, more abstract, ideal: that of integration. At a purely practical level they are devoted to ensuring that the train service is aligned with bus and boat services. But, above that, is a political ambition: a country should see itself as a collective entity, our lives are connected and a civilised, universal and egalitarian transport system gives physical expression to that idea of the Good. The company is a kind of secular religion that worships timetables and connections. By investing in especially beautiful clocks (that are all synchronised), elegant stations, and dignified uniforms and by developing a cult of being on time, the railway corporation tells itself and the wider world about its ideals: that is about how it serves the Good. An employee might be undertaking a comparatively narrow task: monitoring freight movements or checking passenger tickets. But they are rightly proud of being part of this mighty system; which is another way of saying, they can see how what they do actually does serve the nation. We should take in two other aspects: firstly, the Swiss Federal Railways manages to be both highly efficient and in government hands (no need for privatisation when the Good is visible). And salaries do not need to be particularly elevated: because people know what they are serving and are proud to do so.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/106342374.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5402" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/106342374.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Gotthard Tunnel Feature" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>In the ideal economy, all firms would be focused on addressing our true needs. So, they would all have a very good case to make: they would all in fact be serving the Good in some more or less direct fashion. And therefore, every job would be worth doing, and the person doing it would enjoy a full measure of public and self-respect. And the owners of the firms would equally be entitled to such regard.</p>
<p>We aren’t there yet. Many firms (the sellers of trash TV shows; the builders of substandard houses etc.) sell us below average goods and do not advance human welfare in any distinct way. These are the firms where money is everything and where we feel in our bones that working there will only be a means to survive rather than to flourish.</p>
<p>But already we can see the shape of the future of capitalism: a world where we get better at learning to make money from the Good – and where we learn how to make the Good more visible to employees and the world; so that one is working for money, but, as importantly, one can see that one is working to make a slightly better world, one elegant paper clip at a time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the big causes of stress is that we often face problems that can’t be solved in any reasonable period of time or indeed solved at all. It’s going to take five more years until we’re ready to start the job we really want. That big project at work will taken another 24 months before it shows any signs of real progress. The annoying colleague is a daily challenge, with no end in sight. Even now, deep in adulthood, your sibling or parent remains an ongoing source of frustration. You’ve just had the same argument for the twentieth time with your partner; it always ends in apologies, but a real advance is elusive. Your child has again damaged the sofa. In other words, our longing for control and completion is constantly being frustrated – and, as a result, calm can be very elusive.</p>

<p class="p2">Zen Buddhist monks understood this perfectly. In the 15th century, they developed into an art form the task of raking gravel into perfect shapes. In the Zen gardens of Kyoto, gravel is carefully raked into beautifully neat little rows. Perhaps just in straight lines, or with more ambitious patterns of swirls and circles. The lines are often on a very small scale. It’s a fiddly task. You might inadvertently tread on a bit you’ve done. You might struggle to keep the rake going at just the right angle. It could be maddening. But it can all be put right. With a bit more time, a bit of careful correction, you can get it just how it should be. The problems of raking gravel are real. But they can be solved. It’s a bit like doing a jigsaw. At a certain stage you feel that you have no idea where lots of pieces could possibly go. They are spread in little confused heaps on the carpet. Yet, deep down, you know that all it takes is time and patience. Every piece will eventually find its home. It’s tricky, but reassuringly doable – unlike so many other things with which we have to engage.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are not wrong to love perfection. It’s a very good longing. But it needs to be given manageable outlets. That’s why spending half an hour gouging straight lines in a small patch of gravel is therapeutic. It takes the edge off our frustration. It allows for the creation of something ordered, beautiful and harmonious – even if it is only a couple of yards squared.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Merely looking at a picture of carefully tended gravel offers respite and restoration. It reminds us that in all the insoluble chaos of daily life, some things can indeed be made exactly and entirely right.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You might think this bit would be easy, but one of the hardest things about our working lives is knowing what we ideally want to do with them. It’s simple enough to sense what is boring and soul-destroying, but identifying what would satisfy us is a greater challenge. It’s a good deal less straightforward than asking oneself what one wants to eat or drink, sadly because finding one’s way to good work relies (along with many other things) on having a firm grasp of our eventual preferred destination.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Indications of what jobs might appeal to us tend to come in garbled and indirect forms, for example, in those moments of curiosity and envy we sometimes feel when we hear what someone is up to; for example, when we learn that a friend of a friend has started up a project to take Australian high school students to climb Mount Kilimanjaro; or that someone you were at university with has become a chair designer; or when at a party someone tells you about how neuroscience is changing advertising; or there’s a magazine feature on a guy who bought a chain of budget hotels, repackaged them and sold them on, pocketing a fortune in the process…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2544" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/105699467.jpg" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At these sort of moments, from deep within us, we may occasionally register confused signals of interest, akin to the beep a metal detector might let off while passing over an area of waste ground. There is something here, but it can be devilishly tricky to unearth what precisely it might be. We’re given little encouragement to stop and properly interpret our feelings. The urgent task should be to disentangle the underlying identity of a job from the example of the specific person who first aroused our interest in it. If we can see its nature clearly we are then able to look more actively for something else a bit like it in the world around us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might sound self-indulgent to talk of enjoying work when work of any kind is so hard to find, but fantasising about what we ideally want does not have to mean expecting it will be easy to secure it. Ideals are destinations. However, if we get to know an ideal, we can start to figure out more carefully what it might take to head in that direction or what a decent enough alternative might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A priority is therefore to get a better sense of what pleasures are theoretically available among a range of occupations – and to build up a skill at listening closely to what jobs set off those small beeps of interest that hint at a connection with our deepest selves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The pleasures of work</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Ordering</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world is a chaotic place: fractured, incoherent, noisy, random. A central pleasure in a number of jobs is therefore that of being able to bring order to some aspect of life: of creating – in a demarcated space – a realm of superior logic, coherence or meaning. It is the pleasure, in the grandest and simplest of ways, of tidying things up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A great many jobs, and not necessarily the obvious ones, are united by this search for order: doing the laundry, drawing up spreadsheets, arranging a buffet, completing a planning schedule for a logistics company…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the work of a car designer, who finds pleasure in setting every dial in harmony with every other, of creating a fit between the fuel gauge and the rev counter, the air conditioning and the heater buttons, of arranging brushed steel control knobs that press with satisfying clicks and indicator sticks that swipe up and down with unusual assurance – a cabin environment that in its studied solidity is palpably different from the way life usually is.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2545" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/156729725.jpg" alt="Philadelphia Style Magazine Cover Event Hosted By Chris Matthews" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their outputs might be different, but at the level of the pleasure involved, it is perhaps only a small step between what the engineers at Audi are doing and what would have been Andrea Palladio’s satisfactions when designing the Villa La Rotonda near Venice. In both cases, the appeal lies in the chance to create an ordered island within a muddled sea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2547" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Villa_Rotonda_side.jpg" alt="640px-Villa_Rotonda_side" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the pleasures of order aren’t restricted to objects of high art. They are present when raking leaves in a garden or laying a table.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2548" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/6a00e54ed9ed5388330133f57bc127970b-800wi.jpg" alt="6a00e54ed9ed5388330133f57bc127970b-800wi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasures of order would also be present for anyone working on Japan’s high-speed trains. Here too, aboard gleaming carriages, one would have access to a more coherent, logical realm than private life allows for. As humans, we typically feel chaotic inside, confused and irritable, but the trains to which the railway workers devote their working lives suffer from none of these flaws.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its high points, work can permit us to create or maintain something that is ‘better’ than we normally are. The architect, the car designer, the waiter, the train engineer, whatever their differences in status and salaries, draw on a common satisfaction in their ability to create or manage small utopias in an otherwise chaotic, irrational and compromised world.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. Understanding</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then there is the pleasure of understanding. It is present in the working life of a plumber who must pin down what precisely is ailing the heating system within a myriad of pipes behind the kitchen panels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5407087789_835b5883a8_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4340" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5407087789_835b5883a8_b.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="5407087789_835b5883a8_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the pleasure at the root of science, which seeks elegant principles that explain and control the apparent disorder of nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the pleasure of the writer, trying to put words to emotions, pinning down rare elusive butterflies of feeling, defining in language what the reader may have felt but never grasped so precisely before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understanding lends its possessor a thrilling sense of power over the randomness of experience. Through understanding, we acquire one of the keys, however small, to the laws of the universe – and our anxiety and fear decrease accordingly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Money-making</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t just about greed. It’s about being rewarded in the most concrete way, financially, for grasping an aspect of life ahead of your peers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People had been walking past that old jam factory for years. But you were the one who realised what could be done: you could see what others couldn’t. You predicted that the area would change its character because you understood demographic and social change; you knew you could get people to buy apartments because you understood the role of marketing that you’d studied in the car industry. You, the entrepreneur, triumphed over those who were less intelligent about human nature. You can find and unlock value and the proof is the most tangible in the world, it isn’t just acclaim or the pat on the back of colleagues: it is the sum in your bank account.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2552" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Derelict_Factory_-_Alperton_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_311079.jpg" alt="Derelict_Factory_-_Alperton_-_geograph.org_.uk_-_311079" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Derelict Factory, Alperton</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the same pleasure that moves the second hand book dealer at the market, the eBay reseller or the stockpickers in their studies at home. What others thought was junk, or couldn’t even see as valuable, you understood correctly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So those motivated to make money aren’t doing it just out of greed (though that might come into it of course). They may just be addicted to the intense satisfaction that a successful money-generating scheme can give off: the satisfaction – delivered via profit – of knowing that one has grasped some part of the world better than other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2553" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/167647400.jpg" alt="Marche Aux Puces -  Saint-Ouen is home to the Paris flea" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Serving</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The words ‘serving’ and ‘servant’ have extremely negative connotations. They sound feudal, an insult to our independence and pride. And yet to serve another human being offers some of the most intense pleasures available in the working world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A customer has just come in to your cafe; it’s breakfast time; they look a bit frazzled. It’s not a mystery what they need. You’re not trying to invent a new kind of coffee or a special way of cooking eggs. But it’s a delight to be able to bring these well-honed solutions to this person in just the right way. You are busy, but your smile is genuine. And you know that they are grateful – a breezy hello and crisp slice of toast really do help turn a tricky day into something bearable.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To serve well requires a practical application of the power of empathy. One has to start with oneself: What do I enjoy? What delights my eyes, ears and palate?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Pleasing others is a sign that we’ve got it right, that we’ve correctly read ourselves and human nature more broadly. We’ve turned insight into a moment of joy or solace, which in turn lends us a sense of affirmation and triumph over the forces of unhappiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine it’s your job to design a new amenity kit for the business class of an airline. You’ve decided to add a shoehorn. And you’ve selected a leather case, rather than a soft fabric. It’s your taste that’s at work. You are sensitive to your own preferences and your hunch is that others will, given the chance, share it. You tune into your instincts and trust them. With leather, it has to be a particular colour and the stitching must be visible. You’re also keen on mints. At the end of a flight, that’s what you really like, especially as you don’t like using those little basins in the toilets. You didn’t wait for customers to tell you exactly what they wanted: you understood yourself and guessed what would please them. And now the results are in, and the satisfaction scores are off the scale.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To serve gives us a thrilling feeling of power in relation to the needs and vulnerabilities of others. They are looking to renew themselves with a haircut, to repair their faulty computer, to find something to soothe their ailing dog… – and we can be the ones to deliver the solutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through certain kinds of work, we have the chance to contribute in some way to the great task of turning sadness and dissatisfaction into joy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2557" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/73635023-1.jpg" alt="Worried Pet Owners React To Massive Pet Food Recall" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Collaborating</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s 7.30 pm on a Friday night. In lots of other jobs, people would have packed it in ages ago. But you and eight colleagues are still hard at work. And you’re getting to know them in a way you never could around a kitchen table – because you have a shared purpose at last. You’re working together on a presentation for Monday – and it feels a bit like it did when you were eleven and you and some friends worked for hours on a tree house in the garden.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work lends us the pleasure of being part of a team. The challenge brings out everyone’s best sides: someone comes up with a suggestion you’d never have thought of, a colleague compensates for one of your weaknesses, another looks to you for encouragement and guidance that confirms your experience and authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Collectively, a disparate group of people become more impressive than they each could be on their own – thanks to the gift of work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2559" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/8369644728_8538b40b10_z.jpg" alt="8369644728_8538b40b10_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reminding ourselves of the possible pleasures of work helps to correct the misleading view that the only difficulty around employment is the part about getting hired. There’s a prior, equally big challenge of knowing what the ideal position for us would actually be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasures of work are extensions of things we normally first started to like in embryonic form when we were children. In our hurry to please authority figures or impress according to the status structure of the world, we often forget to ask ourselves what truly pleases us. Job categories (‘lawyer’, ‘IT specialist’ etc.) tell us what a person does, but they don’t sufficiently clearly latch on to the pleasure that’s subjectively involved in the task. We need another kind of categorisation which would help us to plot our pleasures: with it, we might say ‘I am motivated by Serving’ or ‘It’s Understanding that gets me going…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coming to know ourselves better, remembering where the true sources of excitement and interest lie for us seems an indispensable step in the long path towards that eventual, infinitely tricky goal: the discovery of satisfying work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">  </span></p>
