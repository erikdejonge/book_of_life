				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadly, we like to think we are becoming a less macho society. But this style of behaviour remains a problem in the workplace: an overbearing, insensitive boss; a bullying colleague; a manager who never accepts any reasons why a project may run into difficulties; a client seems to take satisfaction delivering negative feedback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Machismo has never been very nice. But that’s not the real issue. The problem is it is an ineffective way of managing working relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9888" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C525" alt="14107247290_f5d1c506ea_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet it wasn’t always like this. Machismo has its roots in ways of behaving that in the past seemed reasonable. For a long time, machismo was an effective strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving brusque commands makes perfect sense in some situations. It’s a very good way to get people to turn a boat swiftly starboard, push coal trolleys faster, or increase the rate of production at the blast furnace in a steel mill. When these were the primary forms of work, it was helpful to lead this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And it makes sense to deny vulnerability when having doubts and second thoughts carries no advantage. Far back, the warrior needed to be fully protected; a chink in the armour was all it took to meet your end; fierceness was a key asset.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9873" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.png?resize=550%2C310" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">When it’s very easy to get a serious flesh wound, you have to wear a lot of armour and act fierce</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You didn’t actually need to be nice to people. A worker could feel underappreciated or bullied but still be able to perform their required task. Around physical work, emotional distress didn’t hold things up.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9874" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image021.jpg?resize=635%2C304" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">You could still operate the brick making machine at maximum speed, even if you hated your boss</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, unhappy workers didn’t usually have the option of changing jobs. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9875" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.jpg?resize=635%2C319" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the head gardener had a bit of a macho streak, the men digging the vegetables, watering in the greenhouses, or pruning in the orchard had few alternative kinds of work available to them. They couldn’t just get up and leave because they found the workplace oppressive. </span></p>
<p>Today the world of work is very different. A lot of work now involves careful attention to detail, sustained concentration, being a bit creative, thinking strategically. We’re working with our minds, and so we get very susceptible to the emotional atmosphere. We need respect, recognition and encouragement in order to do our best.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5998141526_8c65edecfb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9886" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5998141526_8c65edecfb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="HA0521 - Bedford staff and M1. A set of images  of HA staff in the Bedford office and new section of M1, north of junction 9. March 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Barked commands and rough treatment are now counterproductive. A wounding comment from a supervisor will drag an accounts manager down all day &#8211; and clients notice even if the boss doesn’t. </span></p>
<p>And people can change jobs more easily. If you upset someone they can go across town, across the world or work for the competition. You’ve lost their talent and they’ll probably never tell you why.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7441249762_1abd945234_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9884" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/7441249762_1abd945234_z.jpg?resize=635%2C447" alt="7441249762_1abd945234_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, the very things that make employees valuable&#8211;sensitivity, ambition, confidence, independence&#8211;also make them likely to leave when they come up against macho behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting the best out of people around work is a delicate and complex task &#8211; and one of the most important practical tasks of management. The workers who understand the value of what they are doing, who don’t get distracted or disenchanted and aren’t drained by anxiety and conflict will produce more and better work. Sensitivity, good communication and empathy (of which machismo is short) are keys to increased productivity and hence profit.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the history of work, managing the psyches of our colleagues and employees is a very new challenge. Machismo was a response to situation we don’t find ourselves in any more. It’s a general issue: we learn skills and attitudes in one environment and get into the habit of relying on them. Then the situation changes, but we don’t manage to adapt. At college we get trained to write long essays with lots of footnotes and lots of evidence and arguments; two years later your powerpoint presentation is judged on brevity and clarity. It’s the same issue in emotional management. We’re only just learning the next move.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many new and potentially very worthwhile ideas for products and services are routinely cast aside by companies with the objection: we must give customers what they want. Which really means: what we have sold them (and prospered from selling them) until now.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneath this response lies a widespread view that consumers must already have a clear and settled idea of what they are looking for in any particular area &#8211; and that this cannot change any more than the cycle of the planets or the laws of motion. Reference to customer taste is therefore a reason to close down any suggestion that deviates from present patterns of demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At its worst, an idea of the unbudgeable nature of customer desire becomes a justification for a businesses to serve up fairly dispiriting things. It explains the dogged adherence to mediocre food:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2693188749_a00c39776e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9674" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2693188749_a00c39776e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2693188749_a00c39776e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Underwhelming architecture:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P2190060.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9672" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/P2190060.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unambitious TV:</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9673" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And standardised holiday offerings.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6662824805_00392451f7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9679" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6662824805_00392451f7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6662824805_00392451f7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of giving customers what they want feels powerful for several reasons. It’s always tempting to stick with a currently successful model that paid for your office, pension scheme and (perhaps) jet. It can also seem arrogant or plain snobbish to hint that there might be a way in which customers don’t quite know what they want &#8211; and that you might be the person to understand tastes they’ve as yet given no evidence of having. Finally, insisting you have the answer to the unexplored wishes of consumers can put you in a recklessly vulnerable position in the politics of the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The consequence is that avenues of pleasure and satisfaction go unexplored and opportunities for growth are set aside &#8211; and move elsewhere (normally to start-ups). Many people in a given corporation may well feel unexcited by the current focus. They might be working fairly hard to meet their sales targets but they are running only for the money rather than tapping into the great resources we find in ourselves when we truly believe in what we are doing. Yet, when someone says that perhaps the business could offer something more impressive, the same answer tends to come back: we have to give people what they want. It’s a way of thinking that lends confidence to the most conservative impulses in our nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the core notion of ‘giving the customer what they want’ is profoundly under-examined and worthy of critical assessment. Of course, the idea of pleasing customers is not in dispute. What needs to be targeted, however, is the mistaken assumption &#8211; working away in the background &#8211; that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people want is a fixed factor &#8211; when in truth, what people want is dramatically malleable, contingent and divergent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that what people want is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">already</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> well established is invariably based on a very small time frame and geographically-bounded sample-size. All we need to do is widen the angle of observation, and a remarkably different picture always emerges. For anyone seeking the confidence to make changes, there’s one unexpected place for immediate inspiration: the history of Culture. </span></p>
<p>When we look back in time, we see an extraordinary range of foreign concerns that seem to violate what we currently understand as consumer taste. For example, in 18th century Britain, members of the same species as we belong to today, the species reputed only to have an appetite for talent shows and celebrity quizzes on TV, got interested on a big scale in poetry. Alexander Pope, the leading poet of the day introduced the twelve syllable hexameter (against the advice of many) and was convinced that consumers would be highly sensitive to its rhythms. He was right. People loved the slightly slower pace and the neater rhymes it made possible &#8211; and he was able to buy himself a magnificent villa, just outside London, on the proceeds.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A_View_of_Alexander_Popes_Villa_Twickenham_on_the_Banks_of_the_Thames_by_Samuel_Scott_RA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9675" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/A_View_of_Alexander_Popes_Villa_Twickenham_on_the_Banks_of_the_Thames_by_Samuel_Scott_RA.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="A_View_of_Alexander_Pope's_Villa,_Twickenham,_on_the_Banks_of_the_Thames_by_Samuel_Scott,_RA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">How did a poet earn enough to have this house?</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an age when we tell ourselves that the only way to be erotic is to reveal more of our bodies, we can take inspiration from a look back to 18th century English fashion, when covering everything except your angle was all the rage.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image06.jpg?resize=500%2C675" alt="image06" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">A tiny lift in the hemline gave ankles a new meaning</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raking of gravel is not something that, at present, seems like a major human concern. But in Japan, over many centuries, people became interested in the patterns into which gravel could be arranged in even very small gardens. Getting it right was hugely important to them. They also became very sensitive to the different characteristics of moss and the best ways of grouping rocks together. It’s evidence of how &#8211; under the right encouragement &#8211; large groups of people can become highly sensitive to features which, in other societies, go entirely unnoticed. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9677" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image08.jpg?resize=618%2C621" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There have been so many moments in cultural history where huge leaps occurred in the kind of things people realised they could like. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9678" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image011.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">There were plenty of people at first who were convinced the public would never go for works like this</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1874, the First Impressionist Exhibition met with immense abuse. There was a widespread feeling amongst art dealers that the public would never warm to things which were so different from what they were currently buying, with brushworth that was choppy, deliberately disjointed and imprecise. However, within a few years, the art market was transformed. </span></p>
<p>Until 1915 most sculpture looked rather like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image091.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9681" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image091.jpg?resize=300%2C536" alt="image09" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then people quickly started getting more excited by this: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9682" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.jpg?resize=550%2C660" alt="Unique Forms of Continuity in Space 1913, cast 1972 by Umberto Boccioni 1882-1916" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These cultural instances reveal a fundamental fact about how the whole basis of our excitement can shift in dramatic ways. Taste is a variable factor. We’re very good at appreciating moves of taste </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in retrospect</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; but in advance we are so much less alive to the inevitable repetition of the phenomenon. Therefore, businesses routinely end up assuming that their customers don’t care about anything they are not currently getting; and get bogged down in the worry that if they introduced something they feel is better &#8211; but rather different from current offerings &#8211; they will be punished. Such timidity tends to doom them. </span></p>
<p>Many businesses could be expanded, redefined or started on more competitive lines by taking consumer demand to new and very good places. There are three guiding principles for changing consumer taste:</p>
<p><em>1.<b> </b></em><i>Doing it with Confidence</i></p>
<p>If you have a good idea which is at the moment out of kilter with the norm, it’s important to be entirely unapologetic. Friedrich Nietzsche is arguably the most admired philosopher of all time; thousands of graduate students are currently writing theses using his ideas. But for much of his career he was an isolated individual living in cheap hotel rooms. But you can’t tell this from his books, which are miracles of confidence. He continually announces himself as the voice of a new era and insists that all philosophy hitherto has been awaiting for his insights to be properly useful. You don’t get the impression that he’s living with almost no friends or that he can’t afford a new pair of shoes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nietzsche is demonstrating that confidence is a powerful psychological tool: the well-expressed sureness of one person is infectious. Confidence relies on a crucial insight: people looking on are less securely wedded to their current beliefs than we usually suppose. The confident person remembers that most people want to fit in. So if you carry it off, they will fit in with you.</span></p>
<p><i>2. Connecting yourself to the Past</i></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image041.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9683" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image041.png?resize=500%2C381" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the Swiss architect Le Corbusier wanted to enthuse the world about modern design, he made a move all innovators can learn from. Rather than saying that modernist architecture was new, he went far out of his way to show that it was in fact a direct continuation of the most revered traditions of the architecture of the past. It was more loyal to the past than more recent work. His polemical text, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Towards a New Architecture</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, repeatedly drew analogies between the modern things he liked, cars and planes especially, and the most prestigious objects of Ancient Western culture. He was placing what he &#8211; and people like him &#8211; approved of in a bigger narrative, laying claim to a sense of natural progression. He wasn’t just making this up as a convenient cover story. He was helping his audience to trust that what was new was in fact, all along, faithful to what they already loved.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image10.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9684" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image10.png?resize=800%2C363" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picasso made a similar move when in 1957 he painted his own version of one of the central masterpieces of European art: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Las Meninas</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Velázquez (painted in 1656). Picasso’s style was radically different from that of his predecessor. But Picasso was situating his work within the grandest tradition of artistic ambition, teaching his viewers that respect for tradition was entirely consistent with enthusiasm for his own work.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">3 . Refusing all market research</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A standard idea of companies seeking to innovate but at the same time cover their backs is to commission market research &#8211; hoping thereby to discover the latent but till now unexplored needs of their customers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But asking people about their preferences can never give us valuable clues as to what they could, perhaps quite soon, come to want &#8211; given the right prompting &#8211; because most of us are simply not self-aware enough to know what is missing from our lives. We know what we like when, but not a minute before, we are given it. We cannot know the shape of our future needs, no more than bookshop browsers in 1910 could have given a pollster an accurate description of their appetite for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by Marcel Proust, a novel that these customers would nevertheless be enjoying in large numbers only a few years later.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only way to produce the products of the future is to interrogate one’s own soul with sufficient tenacity and insight. In other words, to be creative. An over-reliance on market research is a fateful obstacle to innovation (and therefore growth and profit), for it can never show us how things that do not yet exist will answer to an audience’s tastes.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea that companies should simply give people what they want isn’t as powerful a route to safety as it can sound. It is indeed at odds with the bigger facts of culture which show just how flexible, surprising and fast-moving change often is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are still at the dawn of the history of commercial opportunity. At the moment we have firmly in our sights certain needs which have produced reliable returns &#8211; the need for petrol cars that are individually owned, for large handbags with golden clasps, for TV shows with large laughing audiences&#8230; But, comparatively speaking, we’ve barely scratched the surface of human needs. There might be so many new and different things we could come to care about. To close, we’d like to sketch very briefly how three large commercial areas could evolve.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The News</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news industry is going through tough times. Suggesting that this has anything to do with the quality of the product is likely to receive a sharp rebuff from those in the business. The diet of murders, celebrity stories and sarcastic interviews with politicians is apparently exactly what the public wants. But is it really? Might there be room for innovations that appeal to different sides of our natures, sides of us that love sex but not sexual titillation, that want things to be entertaining but meaningful, that want to know bad news but also remain purposeful and resilient?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3550014051_dfef822f78_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9696" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3550014051_dfef822f78_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3550014051_dfef822f78_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The houses we build</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Property developers tell us that taste in housing has all been settled long ago. Customers want either glass towers filled with apartments or else neo-Georgian villas in the suburbs. At the moment some of the biggest architectural developments around the world are assessed only with respect to a couple of areas of interest: are they the tallest in the world and is their shape similar to some small item like a piece of fruit or a phone? But in principle we, the audience, could be sensitised to other, possibly more important, characteristics: do our homes enhance the skyline, do they sit nicely amongst their neighbours at street level or how will they look in 50 years time?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3276057383_08464ce36e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9699" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3276057383_08464ce36e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="3276057383_08464ce36e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How we go on holiday</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At present holidays are categorised by destination: beach, city, mountains and so on. Very little attention has been paid to one’s more emotional desires: to repair a relationship, to bond with the family, to make new friends, to spend time alone. We’re not collectively sensitised to new and potentially very helpful ambitions about what a holiday could be for.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast-food we eat</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently it has to be burgers and fries, especially when are in a drive-in. But we’re the same species that, in 16th century Japan, ate squid and fried eel on the go &#8211; and in Ancient Rome, snacked on marinated duck livers. A far wider road lies open before us than we have as yet dared to imagine.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re not necessarily involved in this kind of judgement ourselves &#8211; but we recognise the phenomenon in our society well enough: the more someone earns, the more they are likely to be admired by strangers; and perceived as interesting and exciting. Respect appears all too often to be directly awarded according to earnings. And, in a related move, if you don’t have much economic endorsement, it can be hard for your character or views to be taken seriously by your society.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not a mystery that this relationship got established, because there are so many conspicuous cases where we find a genuine link between talent, effort, skill, contribution &#8211; and income. The most impressive examples involve the brilliant surgeon, the authors of Matilda and Harry Potter or the team behind the development of graphene. All these geniuses had a lot of talent, they made a lot of money and their contributions are terrific. They make the connections between a high income and virtue seem right and natural.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9649" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010-1.jpg?resize=550%2C627" alt="730px-J._K._Rowling_2010 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s cases like this that give us a natural propensity to suppose that income simply is the chief accurate and proper indicator of the value a person is making to the lives of others &#8211; and therefore that respect should closely track income. This is the view of modern capitalism, and is the spirit one breathes in the big cities of the world’s rich countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such an intuitive emotional response to wages operates with a background economic theory, which we may never describe to ourselves directly but which could in fact be stated as follows: a person’s wages are determined by the scale of their social contribution.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5793535047_2d8223c5e0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9651" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5793535047_2d8223c5e0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Wal-Mart Shareholders Meeting 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But turn to the pages of economics textbooks, and a very different, far less emotive, account of wages emerges. Economics states that wages are a rather simpler business. They are exclusively determined not by social contribution per se, but by the number of people able and willing to do a given job that others want done. If there are lots of people able to complete the task, you won’t need to offer very much money to get their labour; and if there are very few people able to to do the job, you will have to pay a lot more. But note that in all this, there is no room whatsoever to judge the worth of the work being done; the determinant of wages is just the strength of demand in relation to supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taken in one direction, this explains the salary of a hitman, a person who can &#8211; for the most exacting and difficult missions, where the target possesses private guards and is protected by triple glazed Bosch-security glass &#8211; extract an early seven figure sum &#8211; simply because almost no one on earth is capable of carrying out such a complex manoeuvre. Taken in the other direction, the same theory of wages explains the salary of the modern hospice nurse, charged with accompanying people through their last days (a task as meaningful as one could imagine), yet whose yearly salary is a tiny fraction of the murderer’s stipend. In neither case do the wages have any connection to the contributions being made; it simply has to do with how many people are capable of carrying out a task and how much demand there is for it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9653" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k.jpg?resize=635%2C602" alt="8314295456_c80e4fa5e7_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It so happens that in our society, some really wonderful qualities &#8211; like consideration, sympathy and hard work &#8211; are rather widespread; which is lovely but also has a deeply paradoxical consequence: that you can employ someone with astonishing qualities and get away with offering them pretty much nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hitman may have made his money in appalling ways, but unless society asks very careful questions, the world will mostly just see his money and be impressed: they will admire his villa, his sports car, his attractive girls&#8230;and in time he may even emerge as a respected and admired member of the community, who in his declining years wins the hearts of the whole of his society by funding a neonatal unit or new brain scanning department.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9655" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="17214099958_d0dcc7bf58_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the nurse, however much we may pay lipservice to the idea that she’s very valuable, much of the time she will just be an anonymous figure in the bus queue; she’ll not be sought out, people visiting her tiny flat will be a touch sorry for her because the bathroom really does need some work, and her washing machine is held together by duct tape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When these divergent fates are vivid in our minds &#8211; the feted hitman and the downtrodden nurse &#8211; the whole economic system can seem entirely lacking in justice: and our minds rebel against the gross violation of the principles of fairness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9657" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="21639977761_33c05dc6d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s normal if we should then scan the horizon in the hope of finding some answers that can attenuate the pain.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the history of the West, there have been two huge intellectual attempts to resolve this impression of injustice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first is Christianity: a doctrine which has insisted that a person’s worth is to be determined in an entirely different sense to the financial. After death, a person’s soul will be weighed by god and his or her true merits perfectly rewarded for eternity. For eternity, the kindness and devotion of the nurse would be celebrated by the angels. Wages can’t change on earth, but the meaning of the wage will &#8211; in the eyes of Christianity &#8211; be altered, and the humiliation of poverty should hence entirely lose its sting.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9659" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="2651131412_f9ec887d5b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other big attempt to introduce justice took place under the tranquil dome of the central reading room of the British library in the mid-19th century, where a bearded man sat through long sultry summers and gelid winters penning a dense treatise on Capital. Karl Marx’s work argued for a new world in which workers would for the first time be rewarded according to the worth of their contributions to society. Down would go the wages of the hitmen, casino owners and mining tycoons; up would go the wages of the nurse and the farmer. Communism would return justice to incomes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Karl_Marx_001-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9661" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Karl_Marx_001-1.jpg?resize=635%2C663" alt="Karl_Marx_001 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In their own day, these seemed like very impressive solutions. Yet, for different reasons, they are not in any way things we can now put our hopes on. The current economic order is pretty firmly established and is not about to change any time soon. But the hopes remain for some way of dealing with the disjuncture between wages and contribution or wages and respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It may be an odd place to look, but the most immediately usable solution to the situation may lie in a very unexpected place: the walls of an upper gallery in the Wallace Collection in London’s Manchester Square, home to a small painting called <em>The Lacemaker,</em> by a little-known German artist named Caspar Netscher, who painted it in 1664.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9640" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image001.png?resize=635%2C650" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve caught the lacemaker in what looks like a quiet mid-afternoon. She’s concentrating on her difficult task, carefully threading her needle. It will take her around five hours to make just one square centimetre. Her eyes will tire. She will make something dazzling and moving, an externalisation of the best sides of her nature.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9641" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image05.png?resize=800%2C492" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And her reward for her exquisite craftsmanship will be a few pennies at best.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lacemaking was a major industry for women in the 17th and 18th centuries, but, as it happens, it was also one of the lowest paid, for a stubborn, unbudgeable reason we’re coming now to understand: lots of people could do this work.</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, many artists were drawn to paint lacemakers at their task. These artists had no hopes of reforming how lacemakers got paid, but they had an ambition to change the lives of lacemakers nevertheless. They wanted to use art to alter the status of these lacemakers. By directing viewers to the intelligence and dignity of the craft of lacemaking, they hoped to redeem the social standing of this economically slighted class.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-1671.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9643" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_c.1669-1671.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="765px-Johannes_Vermeer_-_The_lacemaker_(c.1669-1671)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-lacemaker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9644" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/the-lacemaker.jpg?resize=635%2C652" alt="the-lacemaker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artists painted lacemakers with all the same tenderness and appreciation as one might accord to a wealthy patron. Through art, we were to stop seeing lacemakers as people who deserved to be ignored and whose low income was any kind of reflection of a lack of merit. Instead we would see them as people full of talent and humanity who &#8211; as it happened &#8211; were just doing a low wage paid job by the accidents of the economic laws of supply and demand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the artists were doing with lacemakers reflects a general capacity of art: to redraw what we think of as prestigious and to return proper appreciation for what certain people, especially those deemed marginal by the dominant social hierarchy, are and do. Art offers us a sensitive re-appraisal of a person’s true merit &#8211; and a complete willingness to disregard wages as a guide to human value.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image031.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9645" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image031.png?resize=635%2C635" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, for all the status we accord it, art is a small thing in the world. But the move that art has made needs to, and can, be redeployed on much larger scale, not just for lacemakers but for all those whose contribution is not currently properly reflected in their wages.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art insists that we be suspicious of wages as an inviolable guide to the value of human beings; they are nothing of the sort &#8211; for they regularly and constantly leave out of the orbit of status people who eminently deserve our honour. We can live in hope of a fairer economy and must search for how to bring it about, but we should recognise that a realistic path to it is currently very hard to chart. It is here that Netscher’s move has such powerful solace to offer us right now.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image022.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9647" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/image022.png?resize=327%2C450" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The way art operates promises an end to a sense of being randomly ignored and humiliated just on the basis of what money we have been able to make. Art is a mechanism for appreciation, which is particularly adept at the close study of the ways in which an individual might be deserving of tenderness, sympathy and admiration &#8211; and yet neglected by the prestigious world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art offers us a best immediate move for remedying at least a part of the problem of the gap between money and human value. The goal of art is to increase the amount of dense and accurate information about people’s jobs &#8211; so that we can stop using mere wages as our measuring rods. Once we get to know people well, in art or otherwise, the state of their bank balance will invariably decline &#8211; and what they are really bringing to the task starts to emerge, along with a fairer way of distributing honour.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In theory, we respect teachers. But being a teacher isn’t glamorous. It’s a worthy &#8211; but slightly dull &#8211; profession. Our suspicions are encapsulated in our collective image of the teacher with the 1950s jacket.</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/History-Boys-008.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8781" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/History-Boys-008.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="History Boys" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because we associate teachers so strongly with schools, it’s natural to assume somewhere in our minds that ‘teaching’ is something most people leave behind as they grow up. We tell ourselves that it takes a very special type of person to be a teacher &#8211; and assume that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we’re just not cut out for that kind of role.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in truth, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">being a teacher</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is one of the most central aspects of human life. Even if we don’t sign up to instruct adolescents in chemistry or history in a school, we will have to become teachers. There is no alternative but to master the art of teaching. Teaching just means getting an insight, emotion, state of mind or a skill from your head into the head of someone else. Teaching happens every hour of every waking day. But we’ve fatally misconstrued teaching as a specific professional </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">job</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when it’s in actuality a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">role </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that everyone has to dip into continually. Whether we like it or not, we’re very frequently required to teach. </span></p>
<p>Being a good teacher is fundamental in the following areas:</p>
<p><b><i>a) Relationships</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troubles in relationships are almost always, at heart, related to poor teaching. There are things in our heads we can’t get across and things in theirs we can’t grasp. Misunderstandings abound and fury and resentment rises. The flashpoints come:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Around sex</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There’s something you’d really like to do in bed with your partner; but you’re very nervous about how they might respond. The tendency is to feel it’s hopeless. Or to get insistent &#8211; which turns your partner off. This is really a teaching issue: we tend not to think of the situation as one where education, and therefore teaching, is the key concern. But that would actually be a more accurate and helpful frame. We don’t say: hold on, can I teach you a short course on attitudes to cunnilingus? But that’s actually what we should be doing. </span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing a problem one is having at work</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you’d love to have your partner’s sympathy; but they’d need to understand quite a bit about the situation at work: why the strategy you’ve been pursuing doesn’t seem to be working, but is actually a good idea; why a certain colleague’s support turns out to be worse than their hostility; why the situation in Mexico matters so much. But getting them up to speed on all this is so hard, you want them just to understand already.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conveying your gripes</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you get enraged by things like the way your partner stacks the dishwasher; by how they close the cupboard door in the bathroom; by their over-confidence about getting to the airport on time. Again, we don’t naturally think of it in these terms, but what’s at stake is teaching: you ideally want to teach your partner how to close the cupboard door, how to load the machine, how to catch a plane.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who you are</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a huge underlying educational theme of relationships is teaching your partner about yourself. It’s a matter of trying to get them to understand the nature of the person they’ve got together with. The fact that &#8211; for you &#8211; certain things are extremely difficult which others take in their stride. Maybe you find filling in forms unbelievably challenging &#8211; not because you are lazy or irresponsible. But because form-filling was always your father’s thing and he made it seem terrifying and dangerous, it was something only he could do. </span></p>

<h5>In love, we might &#8211; for example &#8211; find it very hard to teach each other the difference between rejection and the need for solitude</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or perhaps you really need to spend quite a lot of time alone not because you want to reject your partner, though that’s how they see it, if they don’t understand you properly; in fact it’s because there’s such a lot of things going on in your head that you need time with very low input to try to calm down. Ultimately, it can seem a mystery why you are the way you are. But the more careful explanation is often much less alarming that the worried constructions other people are liable to put on things. </span></p>

<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walt Whitman: like all of us: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I contain multitudes</span></i></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s so much that we never get around to communicating about ourselves &#8211; just what a particular piece of music means to us; why the holiday in Devon when you were fourteen was so memorable; why you like tidying the sock drawer… which counters the tendency in relationships for people to fall into quite narrowly-defined roles. Like the US poet Walt Whitman, we ‘contain multitudes’ &#8211; aspects of ourselves that might be endearing and interesting, but which we tend not to get round to teaching other people about.</span></p>
<p><b><i>b) Parenting</i></b><strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8786" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003.jpg?resize=635%2C619" alt="Jean-Baptiste_Siméon_Chardin_003" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chardin: a lesson in how to have lunch</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parenting is an almost endless sequence of teaching tasks. One might be trying to get one’s child to understand: how to butter a piece of toast, how to avoid escalating a row; how to brush their teeth; how it’s possible to love someone and be angry with them at the same time; how tidying up can be fun; how money is important, yet not an accurate measure of worth; how to put up a tent; what your experience has taught you about the transport industry; what it is to be a friend …</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to download as much of our accumulated wisdom as we possibly can; but doing so is a hugely tricky operation, requiring the best teaching skills. We mostly fluff it, partly because we’re not alive to the enormity of the pedagogical task.</span></p>
<p><b><i>c) Work</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses are places that burden us with huge teaching requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving feedback is really teaching &#8211; though we don’t happen to call it that and so we don’t so easily recognise the true nature of the situation. You are trying to get the person to understand why something matters more than they suppose; or why this way of going about solving a problem is better; or how to know the difference between asking for help when you need it and being too needy and dependent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, in most meetings, there are teaching tasks circulating: I need to teach you about this staffing problem; I need to teach your about the legal perspective; or why this hold up is occurring and why it can’t be solved the way you think it can. If the teaching is done well, there’s a huge potential gain. We tend not to see these as teaching tasks (with much in common with teaching a child how to find the area of a circle or ask for a train ticket in French) so we typically approach them without due respect for the difficulty of the task.</span></p>
<p><b><i>d) Friendship</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s natural to overlook the role of teaching in friendship, because friendship so often originates in a shared outlook. Yet, to be a true friend doesn’t involve formal lessons but it frequently entails teaching: trying to get your friend to see why a course of action they are keen on is not such a good idea; why they should worry less about one problem &#8211; and more about another. Wanting to teach a friend isn’t a mark of being patronising. It’s a desire to guide them to bits of the truth they may not yet have spotted.</span></p>
<p><b><i>e) Politics</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essentially politicians are in the business of teaching societies their ideas about matters of major collective importance: what a good economy is; how to view certain troubling sectors of society (the very rich, the very poor, the very different); what can be changed and what has to be put up with; what’s a realistic aspiration and when potentially dangerous overreach kicks in. We could gauge the health of a political system by asking: how good are the political leaders at teaching?</span></p>
<p><b>So this is a list of some of the things you’ll need to do to be a good teacher:</b></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Have confidence in the business of teaching</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally we are the inheritors of a Romantic tradition that constantly tells us not to teach and instead to be enthusiastic about spontaneous, intuitive responses (go with your gut, listen to your heart). Our age is negative about the idea of teaching &#8211; outside of obviously technical fields. We understand there needs to be teaching when it comes to learning to ski or work out the area of an isosceles triangle. But we’re often quite resistant to the idea of ‘teaching’ around the core issues of human existence &#8211; who should one marry, what is beautiful or ugly, what the media is for, what cities should look like &#8211; we turn against the idea that there can be teachers, because we’re collectively inclined to the Romantic notion that these topics are purely personal and that wisdom can’t be transmitted. So no one has any right to teach. No one should be in a position of authority. We often bristle if someone tries to tell us what to do or how to think. We’re suspicious of the notion of authority in such areas and hence reluctant to see anyone as entitled to teach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a kind of healthy democratic headwind against which any desire to teach (to get others to learn from you) has to contend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we need to burn into our souls is the idea that &#8211; all the same &#8211; it is actually perfectly legitimate and reasonable to try to teach. Everyone has a lot to learn and everyone has something important to impart to others. We should also be deeply aligned with the approach of classical culture: seeing most human activities are areas where learning and teaching are possible and important. In the classical view of things, we can learn (via the teaching of others) how to be kind, how to be funny, how to be better at being married or single, how to run a country or write a successful tragic play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why we should remind ourselves just how deeply legitimate the idea of teaching is.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Admit that learning can be boring</span></i></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8787" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips.jpg?resize=635%2C643" alt="800px-Sir_Humphry_Davy,_Bt_by_Thomas_Phillips" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best teachers of the 19th century was scientist and educator Sir Humphry Davy. He was a very successful researcher in his own right: he discovered chlorine and invented a special kind of safety lamp for use in coal mines. He gave public lectures that were wildly popular, even though they dealt with abstruse and complex scientific topics. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8788" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="Royal_Institution_-_Humphry_Davy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Davy filled his lectures with explosions and comic effects (he loved laughing gas); he made witty remarks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He wasn’t simply being amusing. He was using fun to help him transmit serious ideas he was hugely committed to. He understood that an overwhelming obstacle to learning is boredom. If we get bored, we stop learning. Instead of getting sniffy about this and blaming people for being so feeble and lacking in the bole thirst for knowledge at any cost, Davy simply accepted it as a fact about the human mind and made sure his audiences never failed to learn for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was free of a fatal confusion of ideas which tempts those teaching to think that if what they have to say is important they must present it in a solemn manner. They feel that humour is unworthy of the dignity of the topic. But sadly that often just means that important things don’t get the recognition they deserve.</span></p>
<p><i>3. Understand &#8211; and disarm &#8211; the fear that learning this ‘isn’t for me’</i></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Elizabeth-David-shot-in-h-001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8789" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Elizabeth-David-shot-in-h-001.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Elizabeth David shot in her kitchen in Halsey St Chelsea" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth David was one of the great cookery writers of the twentieth century. But for quite a lot of people she was &#8211; despite her best intentions &#8211; an actual obstacle to learning to cook. Elizabeth David gave the impression that being interested in cooking was only for people like her: female and rather refined. She could say: ‘everyone can learn to cook’ &#8211; but the words alone are not enough to get over this kind of resistance.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4327657744_687a23d69d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8790" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4327657744_687a23d69d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4327657744_687a23d69d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technically, Jamie Oliver is as serious and knowledgeable about cuisine as Elizabeth David was (and he’s often said how much he’s learnt from her.) But he developed a major teaching strategy. To overcome the fear that cooking might be a bit too fiddly and a little too posh, he made huge strategic use of his own blokey, down-to-earth tendencies. He was, in effect, holding himself up as living </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">disproof</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a natural (but mistaken) fear: </span><b>the fear that people like me can’t learn this stuff.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of teaching goes wrong because of a background belief in the student that something they are is incompatible with a lesson. There’s a feeling that I can’t be who I am &#8211; the person I’ve always been, that my friends know me for, who I am comfortable with &#8211; AND get involved in knowing this new thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty much everyone has some version of this. We might feel that we can’t learn coal-mining and be feminine. We might feel we can’t be really interested in making money and pay attention to the views of Karl Marx. Or that we can’t be interested in a fair, more equal society and get interested in 18th-century classical architecture. Or it can feel very awkward to like rough sex and be respectable; read Proust and play football; know engineering and be a feminine woman; be a great worker and make mistakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good teacher disarms these fears as much as possible &#8211; and the simplest, ideal way is to authentically and cheerfully embody the combination that’s supposed to be impossible.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Don’t seem High &amp; Mighty</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instinctively, we often suppose that what we say will be more authoritative and carry more weight if we can present ourselves as pretty much perfect. If you don’t make mistakes, you are going to seem right. Unfortunately, however, this attitude is very rarely shared by anyone who is on the learning side of the equation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, we want to be reassured that the person doing the teaching knows what they are talking about in this particular instance. But the potential for the humiliation of the one learning is never far from the surface. We easily resent being taught. We easily feel that the one doing the teaching is showing off. All this might be very untrue in fact. But it’s the fact that we feel it that creates the obstacle to learning. Being taught places the student in a position (however momentary) of inferiority. You have something, they don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you’re teaching, it’s tremendously useful to surround any ‘lesson’ with active reassurance that you are on the same level basically &#8211; this lesson aside. Show that you too have faults, are often clumsy and goofy. Show that you too don’t know many things. You need to show areas of inferiority so that your own superiority in the teaching area won’t stick out and offend.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Don’t blame the learner for not knowing</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems paradoxical &#8211; once it is pointed out. But the fact is we often get very annoyed that someone doesn’t know something yet &#8211; and we assume they should, given who they are, at this point in their life, with their track-record&#8230; And so we go about the business of teaching them with a background grudge; we feel it’s their fault; they don’t know so they must be stupid, lazy or in some way inadequate. And this attitude makes it unlikely that what we have to teach will actually make its way successfully into this person’s head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of good teaching starts with the idea that ignorance is not a defect of the individual: it’s the consequence of never having been properly taught &#8211; however old one or ostensibly ‘educated’ one happens to be. So the fault, rightly, really belongs with other people who haven’t done enough to get the needed ideas into this individual’s head or simply with the brute fact of belonging to our deeply flawed species. </span></p>
<p><i>6. Pick your moment</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being in the right mood is a huge factor in how well we learn. We instinctively recognise this about ourselves. We feel too tired, too bothered about other things, too excited to take in anything tricky or serious. But it’s much harder to acknowledge this fact when it comes to other people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tend automatically to try to teach the lesson at the moment the problem arises, rather than selecting the moment when it is most likely to be attended to properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood is also crucial to how well we can teach, the more desperate you feel inside, the less likely you are to get through effectively. Unfortunately, we typically end up addressing the most delicate and complex teaching tasks just when we feel most irritated and distressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a panicked feeling that if I don’t jump on this right now it’s going to go on and on unchecked forever. Picking one’s moment means being very sure that you can avoid tackling something right now because you are determined to address it more effectively later on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being skilled at timing has often been recognised as a major virtue and accorded high prestige &#8211; in the history of  warfare, for instance. In 9 AD Germanic tribes won a major victory over the Roman legions. The less well equipped German tribesmen won because they chose their moment well &#8211; when the legions were passing through a thickly-wooded region and couldn’t form up in their accustomed order. Up until then, the Roman generals had assumed that the Germanic tribes would be unable to pick their moments wisely, but would always get so enraged by the sight of the enemy that they would attack on impulse. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8791" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909.jpg?resize=635%2C610" alt="Otto_Albert_Koch_Varusschlacht_1909" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By picking their moment, the fortunes of the Germanic tribes were transformed. Given how central teaching really is to our lives, and how much opportunity is squandered by poor timing, it’s strangely sad that we haven’t as yet developed a cult of great timing in addressing tricky matters in relationships or at work, passing down the stories from generation to generation of how, after years of getting nowhere with impulse-driven frontal assaults, she stood patiently by the dishwasher, waiting until she had put down the newspaper, and then carefully advanced her long prepared point, and eventually won a decisive teaching victory.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. Simplify</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we’re familiar with something &#8211; which is a prerequisite for teaching &#8211; we’ve got a fatal tendency to forget how immensely confusion and challenging new things can be. So when we try to teach we launch into too much detail, we point out refinements before the person we are talking to has mastered the basics. In short, we forget what it was like not to know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simplification can sound a bit condescending. Because we’ve unfortunately come to assume that being complicated is pretty much the same as being intelligent. And we see simplification as the wilful ignoring of the more complex issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another way of looking at this. In fact, we almost never in practice use very complex ideas. We always work with boiled-down, clearer more basic ideas. Getting to these is the real goal.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wittgenstein1-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8792" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/wittgenstein1-big.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="wittgenstein1-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We should take to heart Wittgenstein’s assertion:</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything that can be said, can be said clearly.</span></i></p>
<p><i>8. Coat it in sugar</i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquiring knowledge can be bitter. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The church of the fourteen helpers in Bavaria was built about two hundred and fifty years ago. Strange as it might sound, the ideas that led to its construction are deeply important to the business of teaching. At that time, the Catholic Church wanted to enforce a specific moral. They wanted to say that everyday compassion and care, however humble and ordinary it might look from the outside, is hugely important. The Church wanted to make this message more active in people’s lives, edging us away from our natural selfishness and busy indifference. They had a key idea about something important and wanted to bring more people on board.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8793" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotA.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="PM-050214-monbiotA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">The carrot</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were also keen to avoid a technique which they’d been trying for centuries and that hadn’t worked so well: that of terrifying and guilt-tripping people into being good. So, in this part of Southern Germany, for a time at least, they settled on a different, much more intelligent technique. They weren’t going to talk about hell and damnation any more, they were going to try to seduce people into being good.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8794" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotB.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="PM-050214-monbiotB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stick</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bavarian church is important to teaching because it explores a very different approach. It doesn’t nag, it does not issue stern warnings or upbraid us for being selfish. It does not make us feel guilty about our failings.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8795" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-050214-monbiotD.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="PM-050214-monbiotD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead the architect used every possible means to persuade people through excitement, pleasure, awe and delight. The interlocking domes and vaults are exceptionally beautiful – inducing a mood of lightness and vitality. It is splendid – but for a reason. It is expressing the true glory of modest goodwill. It wants to seduce us, charm us, into kindness. It acknowledges we might need a lot of encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a big lesson here for teachers. There are so many serious things we need collective persuading about. The rich need to be persuaded to be much more generous than they are currently being, bankers need to be encouraged to be more prudent around money, we should be more cautious about damaging the environment, more considered about what we eat and nicer to our children. Good ideas about all of these matters are very prominent already. But teaching too often attempts to motivate us by guilt, rather than charm us into goodness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the most difficult moments in life are in essence f</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ailed teaching moments:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Losing one’s temper: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who is shouting &#8211; who has lost their temper &#8211; was trying to get a point across. Feeling unable to do so in quieter ways &#8211; but desperate to be understood &#8211; they start shouting, swearing and stamping their feet. If we could carefully unravel their intentions, we’d see that they are trying to teach the person they  are angry with (get them to see things in a particular way, to admit a fact).</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Withdrawing: going cold and silent: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feeling that the other person ought to know, can inspire a refusal to teach. I want you to understand but I’m so angry that you don’t already that I will refuse to try.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contempt: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other person is an idiot: they don’t know and won’t learn. Current ignorance is seen as a reason not to teach.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shyness: lack of confidence: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Teaching doesn’t feel legitimate. You fear that others won’t listen; they might get annoyed with you, make you feel ashamed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embarrassment, humiliation: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One feels so confused about what one’s trying to say. One has a go, but it feels boring, over serious, unduly harsh. The person you are speaking to loses interest, of course. You feel a failure.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despair: </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But probably the biggest failure of teaching is when one gives up: you are lost for words, you don’t know where to start, you feel too awkward and nervous, too shy. The possibility of ever really getting the other person to understand fades away. It stops even occurring to you that you could teach them and change their way of thinking. This is expressed as sullenness: where one has come to feel that there’s no point in even trying to explain.</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to teach all the time; but teaching is hard. Every day you&#8217;re called upon to perform these educational moves &#8211; at work, at home, with friends &#8211; without ever having signed up to the task. You didn’t ask to be a teacher. </span></p>
<p>The topics might be quite dissimilar &#8211; a lesson on how to put the butter back, how to code a piece of the website, how to cope with rejection &#8211; but they share many similar features. And they all boil down to the same core: how do you overcome the obstacles to getting what you understand into someone else’s head?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our society hasn’t as yet fully taken on board the scale of the challenge. So we don’t as yet have in place an educational system that assumes everyone is going to have to get good at teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it would be unfair to place the responsibility solely on the idea of teaching. There’s also the parallel, universal role of being the student. We all have to accept that other people have the right to try to teach us things (that we’re far from perfect) &#8211; and that they may be trying to teach us something very valuable, even if they’re making a complete mess of it. We must forgive the unskilled teacher, there may be a grain of truth beneath some blundering efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When someone is doing the teaching process badly, it’s unfortunately natural to assume that they don’t have anything to teach. And that what they are trying to get across is wrong. If you’re being boringly nagged about not eating enough broccoli or about the importance of checking the window locks before going out, it’s deeply tempting to reject not just the annoying </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">way </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">you’re being told, but also the validity of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you are being nagged about. We don’t just feel like shooting the messenger. We also want to shoot the message.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core point is taking seriously the idea that we’ve still got a lot to learn from other people and that being a student is a skill &#8211; even if the teacher isn’t up to scratch we can still extract a benefit from what they know that we don’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a hopeful side to all this. We’re not as yet generally focused on learning how to teach; but it’s not a huge mystery. We already know collectively a lot about good teaching: we’re just not ambitious enough about deploying this knowledge very widely. We’ve seen teaching as a specialist professional skill that only a few people need to master. In fact, we’ve all got to get better at it in order to have somewhat less fractious lives.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we meet new people, we’re tempted to ask: &#8216;what do you do?&#8217; We’re picking up on the idea that our identity is very linked to our daily tasks. But the way the question is answered tends to lock on to the practical externals of our jobs. So a dental hygienist will explain how they keep plaque at bay; a corporate lawyer will mention a merger they’re engaged with that’s been in the news recently; a sound technician in a studio will detail how they rewire equipment, install new bits of routers and liaise with tricky ISPs around the world.</p>
<p>However, what’s more revealing, but more elusive, are the <i>psychological</i> requirements and consequences of jobs &#8211; what mindsets a job breeds, what doing the job requires of your inner life, how it expands us and (crucially) limits us.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8349" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="9312582362_6f5c61f41c_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Our culture usually skirts round this territory. If we asked: ‘what’s the psychological character of your work?’ the answers would look very different. The dental hygienist might say: I deal a lot with evasion and weakness of the will; otherwise intelligent, trustworthy people cancel on me all the time, blaming their schedules. When they do show up, they sit in my chair and repeatedly lie to me about how much they’ve flossed and break all their promises they made last time about looking after their teeth. I’m daily brought up against how hard adults find it to do pretty basic things that are in their own interests. It can make me a bit stern.&#8217;</p>
<p>The corporate lawyer might answer: &#8216;I’m daily up against the aggression and impatience of my clients. They want everything done yesterday. No one cares about anyone else’s private life. I see a lot of raw ambition &#8211; nothing would really surprise me about the human capacity for duplicity.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9291648625_319dc9bea3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8352" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/9291648625_319dc9bea3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9291648625_319dc9bea3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The sound engineer might say: &#8216;problems crop up all the time, but you can always be sure you will find a solution if you are methodical and careful. There might be seven possible causes of a problem, and you have to check each one. But it’s definitely going to be one of those. I love technology in that sense, things are bounded and logical.&#8217;</p>
<p>We could categorise jobs in terms of their psychological profile &#8211; according to what traits of human nature they weaken or reinforce:</p>
<p><i>Patience vs. impatience</i>: does the job train you to instinctively prioritise what’s happening right now and to regard what might occur a few years down the line as not really your business (A+E nurse, news editor)? Or does it get you into the habit of plotting your concerns in the scale of several years? (aeronautical engineer, civil servant overseeing power station construction)</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8355" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="16371178501_34359cb448_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Flickr/Royal Navy Media</h6>
<p><i>Suspicious vs. trusting</i>: does your work sharpen your sense that the real agenda might be quite different from the overt one? Are you in an environment in which people usually keep their cards hidden or outright lie (journalist, antiques dealer, management consultancy)? Or does your work generally involve you with people who are very upfront about their true concerns (psychotherapy, skiing instructor, air traffic control)?</p>
<p><i>Speculative vs. concrete</i>: is the work focused on how things could be or on attention to how they happen to be? Does one get rewarded for envisioning things other people haven’t quite thought of (think tank researcher, poet, futurologist) or for careful attention to practical detail? (fresh fruit logistics, roofer)</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14947050571_da81956cb9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8361" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/14947050571_da81956cb9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="14947050571_da81956cb9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i>Consensus-seeking vs. independent</i>: some kinds of work teach the ability to merge with the collective view (school teacher, holiday rep); others invite the foregrounding of a personal viewpoint, an unusual take on things where not doing what others are doing might be a key advantage? (tennis coach, entrepreneur)</p>
<p><i>Optimistic vs. pessimistic: </i>how does work encourage you to see the positives, and maybe avoid dwelling on the downsides (marketing, personal coaching, sommelier) or does it lead to a habit of foregrounding the dangers, the pitfalls and looming disasters? (accountants, in-house counsels)</p>
<p><i>Financially focused vs. sheltered from finance</i>: is one in an environment where status varies hugely with money (solicitor, corporate executive) and where it is instinctive to think in terms of costs and profit margins; or does the work day to day not really involve such considerations at all? (academic, teacher)</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8357" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint.jpg?resize=635%2C615" alt="733px-Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_by_Alfred_Clint" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i>Dignity is fragile vs. a solid status</i>: an artist is generally exposed to deep rebuffs; the things they have put their soul into may well be turned down or ignored. Even if they are pretty good at what they are doing, they may have no tangible public success. The eleventh best poet in the UK earned GBP 6,117 last financial year in royalties, advances, small grants and public appearance fees. Other jobs mean that reasonable application and ability is sure to be well rewarded: every bachelor of veterinary science is guaranteed a well-paying job.</p>
<p><i>Better nature vs. worse nature</i>: some jobs, however hard, continually remind you of the preciousness of life (palliative care, midwife) whereas in others you are always meeting the less admirable sides of human nature (police, family law).</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/402725350_72c28b37e8_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8364" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/402725350_72c28b37e8_o.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="402725350_72c28b37e8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p><i>Logical vs. haphazard hierarchy</i>: in some jobs, it’s clear what you have to do to move forward and how promotion occurs (airline pilot, teacher); in other jobs (television production, politics), the rules are a lot less settled and are bound up with accidents of friendship and fortuitous alliances. In the former, there is a calm and steadiness to the soul. In the latter, there is a constant anxiety &#8211; and lack of trust.</p>
<p><i>Being in a declining vs. a growing industry</i>: there are industries where it feels that the golden age was in the past; it’s probably less fun to be working in them now than it used to be (publishing, broadcast television, diplomatic service). Or is the whole industry growing, with all kinds of highly profitable new ventures emerging (social media, technology). Do you tend to work around people who feel they can conquer the world, or who sense that the world is about to conquer them?</p>

<p>Being in a particular psychological environment every day for years has a pretty big impact on our habits of mind. It influences what we assume other people are like, it forms our view of life and gradually shapes who we are. The psychology inculcated by the work we do doesn’t stay at work. We carry it with us into the rest of our lives.</p>
<p>We’re generally very aware that that can happen… in distant places. We understand that a French aristocrat in 1430 will have a particular outlook shaped by the fact that they have lived their life in a very strict social hierarchy,  surrounded by a warrior ethic; or that someone from a 19th-century fishing village in in the Western Isles of Scotland, who has spent years battling storms off Benbecula, will have have a character profoundly marked by their working life. We are no different. The only difference is that we find it much harder to notice what has happened in our own case, because &#8211; of course &#8211; our outlook feels natural to us, though it is anything but. It may take an encounter with an alien (in the shape of someone from a very different field) to get us to notice.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/13530251873_c278a75a40_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8370" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/13530251873_c278a75a40_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="13530251873_c278a75a40_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>We can sometimes catch the effects of work on character in social situations. If you ask a solicitor, ‘what do you think cars will be like in 2035?’ they may be puzzled about why you would want to exercise your brain this way. What is the point of speculating about something currently unknowable? Obviously things will evolve in unexpected ways. But there will still be laws and courts and regulations. And we can deal with them when they arrive.</p>
<p>If you ask an academic, ‘what are your earnings per hour?’ or ‘what’s the financial return on your investigations into the history of Swedish grammar?’, they will find the question tendentious. &#8216;Why are you asking? What does it matter?&#8217; Though to you it may feel like an obvious point of enquiry. Or, if you raise with a commodities trader how their work benefits others the question might sound to them strangely naive: what would make you think the point of work was anything other than the personal advantage of the individual concerned?</p>
<p>We’re broadly aware that the way people learn to think at work can be traced in their domestic and social character. The primary school teacher treats their children as pupils, the academic lecturer becomes a windbag at dinner parties, the politician can’t help making speeches as weddings.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12245837686_d413da8fcb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8372" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/12245837686_d413da8fcb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="12245837686_d413da8fcb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>But these are the tip of the iceberg, there are plenty other such cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>The technician is deeply calm and reassuring. Probably, they feel, all problems in life are a bit like the technical problems they have mastered at work. Most things can be put right, if you don’t panic and work your way down a checklist.</li>
<li>The TV executive has a fragile sense of self. They are quite aggressive when they think they are on top, but fold quickly when they sense the wind moving against them.</li>
<li>The dental hygienist becomes bossy. They are so used to having to upbraid people for being lax, it becomes a habit.</li>
<li>The freelance writer, who is always having to grudgingly mould their work to the demands of others, becomes used to feeling misunderstood and under-appreciated. At work, the better parts of their ambition have to be subordinated: their piece on Venezuelan architecture gets sidelined but their advertorial on the fashion for pink diamonds has a ready market. They’re always expecting to be misunderstood, and become hyper alert to any signs this might be happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work can be very good for people. The mentality fostered at work might be making up for aspects of the self that didn’t get properly developed before. In an office where speed and accuracy are crucially important, someone who is slightly scatterbrained might acquire a corrective to their earlier weakness. An environment where compromise feels natural can be hugely educational for the person who has been over-invested in asserting their own views.</p>
<p>But work can narrow our characters too. When a certain range of issues and ways of thinking become entrenched, it means that others start to feel awkward and even threatening.  A person who has become very used to implementing the ideas of others &#8211; and maybe very skilled at it &#8211; can then find it deeply uncomfortable to be put on the spot and asked what they think the big objectives should be. They’ve got entirely out of the habit of asking themselves such questions. A school administrator might be very sharp when it comes to how you would reorganise the the personnel roster, but if you ask ‘what is education for?’ it sounds baffling, like asking what is grass for or why is London in England not in Scotland?</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8374" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="6203726843_a6eff4f6de_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Furthermore, something too moral and earnest might threaten the TV executive. Or an enquiry into their views on the French Revolution might might threaten a personal trainer. One feels that such questions are painful because they are reminders of what one has had to renounce in order to become focused on a particular job. By giving a large part of one’s life to a particular kind of work, one has &#8211; necessarily &#8211; not been able to life to do justice to other areas of potential. One has lost the power to engage with issues which might once have seemed intriguing.</p>
<p>The general idea that work shapes us applies, of course, to oneself. But precisely because certain attitudes and habits come to feel natural, it’s hard to notice that this has happened. There’s a fundamental question we might ask ourselves: in what ways might my own character have been shaped (for better or worse) by my work (just as it is important to grasp how one has been shaped by childhood)? There’s a poignant autobiographical question: if I’d done a different job, would I have been a different person? And the answer must be yes. Contained within other career paths are other plausible versions of oneself &#8211; which, if contemplated, reveal important, but currently undeveloped, elements of one’s character. It gives rise to the most tricky of questions: where are those other bits of me…?</p>
<p>Keeping in mind how work shapes a person means we should be slower to blame other people for the way they are. Perhaps it is their job, not ‘them’ that has made them as they are &#8211; that has made them so nervous, angry, or boring. It’s the employment environment we should blame, not them. The TV executive was not always like this, the corporate lawyer was not born as they now are. They might have been other people. Our identities are vulnerable to our jobs. And that may open the avenues of pity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We tend to be pretty clear why it might be nice to be in a leadership role. There’s more status, you get to decide how things should be and &#8211; very often &#8211; you get paid more too. But there are some dark aspects too.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are five of them… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: You become the object of satire</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The rise of satire</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s deeply pleasing to lob witty criticism. And it’s a natural tendency too.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2735622368_454c2173eb_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7760" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2735622368_454c2173eb_o.jpg?resize=635%2C276" alt="2735622368_454c2173eb_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1">They’re so good at identifying weakness and failings. The physics teacher is a bit disorganised, wears a jacket with strangely thin lapels and occasionally misses certain portions of his face when shaving.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might have something of a talent for this yourself. There has always been satire, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7756" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray.jpeg?resize=635%2C457" alt="640px-L-Assemblee-Nationale-Gillray" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1">The leading politicians are vain and stupid &#8211; and usually very ugly as well</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, the artist James Gillray portrayed Charles James Fox &#8211; leader of the Opposition &#8211; as a villainous looking half-wit (he’s standing centre right, slightly bowing, with a blue coat and yellow trousers, with a sword at his side). Everyone in the picture has their faults highlighted. Many look unbearably smug; there’s an individual in a crimson jacket bowing practically to the ground and looking farcically obsequious: it’s William Grenville who became Prime Minister a couple of years after the print appeared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gillray was regarded as the greatest satirist of the age. But by modern standards he was operating on a small scale. His works could only be seen by fairly small numbers of people. And his satire sat within a culture in which the traditions of respect and deference were still very strong. For a long time to come, it was easy and normal for those in power to feel that satire, while annoying, wasn’t actually terribly important. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles_James_Fox00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7757" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Charles_James_Fox00.jpg?resize=635%2C651" alt="Charles_James_Fox00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charles James Fox was generally portrayed in a more flattering light. In any case, his status was not derived from popularity or approval. In 1768, when he was nineteen, his father bought him a seat in parliament. The party he led, the Whigs, was largely made up of his friends and relatives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This, really, was what limited the power of Gillray’s effectiveness. He could be savage. But the manoeuvring of high politics largely went on without reference to popular opinion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One feature of the modern world &#8211; which mostly is great and very positive &#8211; is that people got sick of respect. And the disappearance of automatic respect occurred at the same time as a rise in the dependence of leaders on approval. The development of democracy and of market research has meant that leadership is often vulnerable to what strangers think. So caricature hits harder: it’s a bigger threat. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/March-1991-007.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7761" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/March-1991-007.jpg?resize=635%2C336" alt="March-1991-007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Homing in on the slightly ridiculous aspects of John Major, the British Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, (his tendency to look timid, his reputation for naivety, his fondness for the colour grey) wasn’t just a personal irritant. It undermined his public standing and weakened his electoral position. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moves we see played out at a national stage are also equally directed at more or less everyone who arrives in a position of leadership or authority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before you become a leader &#8211; or a manager or a boss or an employer &#8211; you are on the side of satire. You are very adept at seeing what’s not going quite right, you are good at identifying who to blame and you can see all the mistakes and errors of those making the decisions. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The powerful are the accepted targets of satire</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is hugely to our collective credit that we have come to find it unacceptable for the strong to mock the weak. We now reserve our sarcasm, jibes and fault finding for those we think can take it &#8211; and in fact deserve it &#8211; because they occupy the privileged positions; those who are in charge in some way are not only fair game: we almost feel it is our duty to voice our criticisms as loudly and as effectively as we can.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7763" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="5300436468_71fb33cf9e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern world is very alive to the failures of power. Sympathy for the powerful is seen as naive. Which is fine, until you yourself end up in leadership. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">You will be misunderstood </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It all looks very different from the point of view of the person in the leadership position. Fox certainly had his weaknesses (he liked gambling, he had multiple mistresses, he used to spit on the carpet) but he was also a major advocate of ideas he deeply believed in and knew to be crucially important: the abolition of the slave trade and the evolution of the political rights of the general public. Gillray’s caricatures and mockery don’t touch the substance of what Fox was trying to do or why he thought these things mattered.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>John Major wasn’t the character the cartoons made him out to be. It is clearly not possible to become the leader of a large modern country without being at least extremely astute and intensely determined.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Like Fox, Major’s an example of a very general pain of being in a leadership position: you get misunderstood and misrepresented. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Your flaws are on public display </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your flaws are visible and you won’t be able to do anything about them. You can’t turn you character around. And if you tried you’d get called out for doing that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6486473213_55ea866316_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7764" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6486473213_55ea866316_b.jpg?resize=635%2C631" alt="6486473213_55ea866316_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">The complaints are unrealistic </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A complaint is made up of two distinct elements: Dissatisfaction + the belief the problem can be (easily) solved = complaint</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t complain when things feel inevitable or unavoidable. You can’t <em>complain</em> if it’s cold in Norway in winter or if Scotland fails to win the World Cup. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the leader &#8211; or manager or boss &#8211; the complications and difficulties that lie behind the problems are more apparent than they are to the employees. You become the lightning rod for free-floating dissatisfaction and envy. People will be mean not because you have done anything in particular to deserve their ire, but because you are the nearest available target. We can’t always work out very accurately why we are feeling bothered, frustrated, disappointed or short-tempered. But we need to have someone to blame: and the ideal target is someone who is nearby and who looks like they can take it: in other words, the leader. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: You have to become a poet </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You may have trained in electrical engineering; your career may have recently focused on supply chain management. But at some point leadership is going to require you to become a poet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Morale </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason is to do with morale. One of the key issues in the history of warfare has been the power of morale. At critical moments in battle a single person turning to flee could lead to mass panic, while if one person shows confidence, whole mass of troops can follow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In Tolstoy&#8217;s <em>War and Peace</em>, there’s a critical battle scene when one of his main characters, Prince Andrei, is engulfed in a flood of fleeing soldiers. Desperate to rally them, but alone, Andrei jumps off his horse, grabs the regimental flag and starts shouting and running forwards. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BZ6FaX.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7765" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BZ6FaX.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="BZ6FaX" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward and overtook him. A sergeant ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrei’s hands &#8211; but he was immediately killed. Andrei again seized the standard and, dragging it, ran on.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It works, the troops gain heart, regroup. It’s a moment that’s really important for Tolstoy to describe because he’s fascinated by the way small things can make a huge difference. He’s describing how the confidence of a leader can be transmitted to the followers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Morale depends not only on the confidence experienced at a specific moment but more broadly on the conviction that the undertaking is important, and honourable. At the extreme, people will stand in front of tanks, they will put their lives on the line because they believe that something is truly important. We feel committed and ready to make a sacrifice when someone has explained clearly enough why something is really worth doing. Company morale is pride in what is being done and your part in it, the belief that hard tasks can be completed, that it’s worth trying harder, that other people feel the same way and that you can rely on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Company morale is created by leaders &#8211; though it doesn’t need to be on the scale that take people into battle. It’s not going to involve literally shouting ‘forward lads’ and waving a banner. Instead, the modern leader needs to be a poet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">What poetry is for</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poetry is the ambition of using words to get ideas into our imaginations, so that they influence our lives. It’s based on the realisation that how you present something matters hugely for its effectiveness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Portrait-of-Horace-011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7780" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Portrait-of-Horace-011.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Portrait of Horace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman poet Horace identified two key features of good poetry. Poetry he said should be<em> dulce</em> and<em> utile</em>: that is, it should have <em>utility</em> and <em>sweetness.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Utility</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Useful means: that it addresses the problems a person actually has, that are in fact getting in the way. Usefulness depends upon a grasp of what it is that is giving someone trouble. As a generation living after the Romantic call that art should be just ‘for art’s sake,’ it’s surprising and invigorating to find a poet who wants poetry to do things in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Dulce &#8211; sweetness or attraction</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sweetness means that it’s something you like: it’s attractive, alluring. You don’t have to try and force yourself to keep going (because you know that, despite the pain, it’s good for you).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>J.K. Rowling’s work is ‘sweet’ in the sense that Horace meant. Instead of parents and teachers trying to make children read, promising them rewards to read to the bottom of the page, they found that they couldn’t get certain children to stop reading. It was one of the unfortunately quite rare times when something very worthy (learning to read)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>was also compulsively attractive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Horace’s ideas about poetry show why certain poems work so well. For instance, &#8220;They Fuck you Up&#8221; by Philip Larkin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/philip-larkin1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7767" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/philip-larkin1.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="philip-larkin1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They fuck you up, your mum and dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>They may not mean to, but they do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They fill you with the faults they had</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And add some extra, just for you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But they were fucked up in their turn</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>By fools in old-style hats and coats,<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who half the time were soppy-stern</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And half at one another’s throats.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its <em>usefulness</em> is that it says you can’t help it that your parents let you down and that they didn’t mean to, they couldn’t help. The failures of your parents were not a specific failing of them, but a sad and entrenched feature of the human condition. It’s not necessarily useful for everyone &#8211; but a lot of people DO need to hear this message again and again: they let you down, they didn’t mean to; their parents let them down;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>if you have kids, you’ll let them down and you won’t mean to either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Its <em>attraction</em> &#8211; it’s direct and swift and easy to remember. In fact, the opening two lines are now the best known lines of 20th century English poetry. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sweetness + usefulness = great poetry and great memos and power-point presentations</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The leader needs to be a poet because they need to make the project of the company motivational; out of the millions of things they could say (the shareholders are pleased; our copper wiring is 3% cheaper than our rivals) they need to find the things that speak to the heart of the people they lead. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: You have to leave your old friends </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 19th century, when people immigrated, they knew that they would probably never see their old friends again. They were taking a step with major consequences. They were acutely conscious of the scale of what they were doing. They had sold their cottage; they had packed up all their belongings; they could feel the slow movement of the ship. They had a fourteen week journey before them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brown_last_of_england.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7768" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Brown_last_of_england.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="Brown_last_of_england" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They knew there was no going back</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many steps in life which have a similar character &#8211; they take us to a new world from which we can’t return. But they are usually less overtly dramatic. And so the trauma is not so easily recognised &#8211; though we suffer just the same.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the pain of the process of maturation. When you become an adult you can’t ever really be a child again &#8211; though you will often be childish. You won’t ever again feel the complete ease that comes from the assured conviction other people will look after everything; perhaps climbing a tree will no longer feel like the most wonderful adventure in the world; a chair will never again be a sailing ship, or the space between your bed and the wardrobe, the Pacific ocean.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To become a leader is to undergo a change of this kind. Some earlier (and very nice) versions of oneself will have to be packed away. The sarcastic genius may not be coming back. The people you used to share a lot of good times with at work will think you’ve changed &#8211; and become more distant; you won’t be such fun to be around. You’ll seem colder. You’ll lack a sense of humour.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Four: You need to be like Jesus</strong> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Irrespective of one’s religious beliefs, it’s clear that Jesus was one of the great leaders of all time. One of the main secrets was he united two characteristics that generally seem opposed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He was powerful</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The central idea of Christianity is that Jesus is the son of God and has immense power.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1">‘He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead’</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But at the same time… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">He was one of us</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The stories of the life of Jesus stress how normal and average he was in lots of way. His parents weren’t at all well off. Until he was thirty, he worked in his dad’s carpentry shop. One story told of how some of his supporters were making quite a long journey on foot to a place called Emmaus. Jesus joins them &#8211; in disguise. They chat with him, they talk about a lot of things. And they just think that he’s an ordinary, interesting man. It’s only when they get to their destination and have a meal, and Jesus blesses the bread in his special, characteristic way, that they recognise him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7774" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The great sellers of Religion &#8211; like the baroque painter Caravaggio &#8211; loved this story. They realised what a key selling point the ordinariness of Jesus was. You could sit down and have a meal with him. He had the same kind of worries and troubles as you. He understood, he knew what your life was like. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea was that Jesus won the trust and loyalty of his followers at a very personal level. He didn’t simply impose or demand or assert his superiority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Jesus-type role (combining being ‘above’ and being ‘with’) is demanded by the modern workplace. To be effective, leadership has to be founded on personal trust. A great complaint about leadership is that the leader doesn’t understand, or has forgotten, or doesn’t care about what it is like for those lower down the system. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just inherently difficult to be both of these things at once: to be intimate and also be in charge. Traditionally, these are distinct roles. We’re not especially cut out to do the two of them at the same time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People in authority who have understood the moral of Jesus’s story know how to do leadership and ordinariness.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When she takes public transport, the Queen of England is at one level doing a very normal thing. But because she does it, it is – of course – astonishing: because she could easily afford to go by helicopter, because she is the woman who was crowned in Westminster Abbey, Queen of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the sea, defender of the realm and of the faith.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Co7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7777" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Co7.jpg?resize=635%2C627" alt="BRITAIN-ROYALS-CORONATION-ANNIVERSARY-ROYAL-FILES" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Now she’s on the train in the seat next to me</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What touches us, even if we don’t usually spell it out, is that she is both the sovereign and a passenger at the same time, both extraordinary and normal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hierarchy is a deeply painful aspect of human society. There are good reasons why wholesale equality isn’t practical, but the longing for understanding and sympathy by the powerful towards the less powerful runs deep. That’s why it is deeply moving – and plain reassuring – if we see someone who could fly by helicopter take the train. It bodes well for the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We live in societies that are officially egalitarian and meritocratic. Yet we are endlessly exposed to massive differences in wealth, power, status and fame. We’re fascinated by the lives of top people. Yet we are troubled too. Do they understand? Do they know what it’s like? Any hints that they do are deeply significant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the Queen takes the train, she is bridging the world of history, grandeur, money and power – and the world of everyday life. The cynical (or just ambitious) voice might at this point say that there should only be average, normal, egalitarian things. But as this is unlikely to happen any time soon, what we desperately need is people at the top who properly understand their responsibilities towards the many. The Queen knows this, and that’s why she is rarely more appreciated than when she takes her place in a second class carriage of a provincial English train.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: You will be hated: Learn a lesson from the Home MBA</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s one arena where we don’t nowadays expect to learn very much that could be useful to us in the workplace: home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Home is meant to be a location for relaxation, sweetness and fun, a break from the arduousness of the office. Furthermore, in so far as there are children, modern parents are not expected to ‘lead’, merely to try to make life as pleasant as can be for young charges.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The notion of paternalism &#8211; of a more authoritative kind of domestic leadership &#8211; has become poisoned and the target of constant scepticism. When, in 1964, Bob Dylan sang to a generation of parents that &#8220;your sons and your daughters are beyond your command&#8221; (The Times They Are a-Changin&#8217;), he was counting on an instant recognition of the multiple failings of parental authority.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difficulty of parenthood is that one is asked to be the guardian of the long-term interests of someone who will be absolutely convinced, on multiple occasions, that one is deeply and viciously wrong (about the computer, the sleep-over, the car use…). And indeed one may be, which doesn’t preclude the need to come up with a plan and a principle. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is always a matter of surprise to a new parent how much they can love their child and also, how weird it is to have to say ‘no’ to them &#8211; and then be the target of special hatred by someone they would lay down their life for. The role of a parent is a training ground in the inevitability of taking unpopular decisions &#8211; and in not expecting sympathy or gratitude for a very long time indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be 25 years until they understand why you took a certain decision &#8211; let alone grudgingly acknowledge there might have been a point to it.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern leaders and modern parents aren’t inclined to draw parallels between their activities; to think that &#8220;my children are my employees&#8221; and &#8220;my employees are my children.&#8221; Yet it’s mere squeamishness on our part that we don’t see domestic life as the training for the office (and for leadership roles especially) that it might be. There are MBAs to be earnt at the kitchen table and honed amidst the anguished screams around bedtime and teeth-brushing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a habit of stressing the benefits and understating the negatives of major development in life. Weddings generally exaggerate the joys of coupledom, becoming a parent is generally discussed only in its fulfilling and exciting aspects. It’s not that there are no good points, of course. It’s just that on their own they give an unhelpfully unrealistic account of what we’re getting into. They raise expectations too high. So by comparison, being married or being a parent is a let down.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The risk is that we get very disenchanted and panicky when things turn out to be very much tougher than we’d anticipated. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The position of being the boss, joining the leadership team or generally having more responsibility and power seems enviable. But as we’ve been seeing, it’s got considerable difficulties and troubles that come with it too. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we assume that something ought to be quite easily within our grasp and not too difficult to do, we get panicked and worried if we suddenly find we’re having a very hard time. We think that there must be something particularly wrong with our characters, we fear we’re not cut out for the role, that we don’t have what it takes. But our feelings are not actually fair to ourselves. They are really caused by our initial expectations than by any special defect in ourselves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For much of history, the question was taken very seriously – and quite often the answer was a definite ‘yes’. A whole range of jobs were seen as incompatible with relationships. They weren’t necessarily saying you need to be chaste and avoid sex; it was the demands on time and the emotions that was the real focus of concern.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">St Hilda of Whitby was one of the most powerful and accomplished women in the early history of England.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7712" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="StHilda" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was a very senior administrator, running large agricultural enterprises; she was a management consultant to kings and princes. She was a leading educationalist. And she did all this while being noted for her good temper. Of course, she was unmarried. It’s not that because she was a nun she wasn’t allowed to get married and so had to make the best of her work opportunities without a supportive home life. The line of thought ran the other way round. She was able to have a stellar career and achieve so much for the community because she was free of the demands of relationships and domestic life. Being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a nun meant she lived in an efficient collective household – she would be supplied with meals, laundry and heating without having to organise everything for herself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was an approach to certain kinds of work – intellectual, administrative and cultural – that persisted for many centuries. In 1900, academia in the UK was still almost entirely a career for the unmarried.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7713" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="201011-formal-hall-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Fellows of King’s College, Cambridge in 1900: not being married was one of the job requirements</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The view was that certain kinds of jobs require such effort and continuous devotion and they loom so large in your imagination that you really shouldn’t try to combine them with the duties of a relationship, a family and looking after your own home. To do them properly, you should live in very well-organised commune (like a monastery or a college), you should be single and you should socialise mainly with people who are involved in the same kind of work, because they will understand you and also be able to help you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reminds us that we’re asking ourselves to do lots of complicated things at once. No wonder we squabble, feel resentment and the occasional burst of despair. We think it should be easy, if you’re a half-decent person, to be a success at work and an excellent domestic partner. But your job requires so much effort. Your sneaking background suspicion that someone who does your job might be too busy to empty the bins or make the bed could actually just be true. You deserve a lot of sympathy.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-006E688C00000258-88_634x423.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7673" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-006E688C00000258-88_634x423.jpg?resize=634%2C423" alt="dvt getty woman on plane with laptop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s 4.30pm, Thursday. The plane is still on the tarmac at Milan-Linate awaiting take off for the flight to Heathrow. Ellie makes herself open her laptop. Out of the window: the tail of an Airbus A320 shimmers in the afternoon light; a dark band of distant trees. The Tate and Lyle Environmental Compliance briefing document is going to need a lot of revision, after the discussions about the Brindisi plant. She drinks some mineral water. There’s another early start again in the morning. The person in the seat in front (just visible through the gap) is flicking through a magazine, licking their middle finger before turning a page. There are three emails about the Rotterdam contract and photos from her sister’s birthday dinner party last night, which she missed by about 939 miles. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cabin steward offers a newspaper &#8211; she hasn’t time for it really, just for the <em>Guardian</em> headlines: the Mexican economy has failed to meet growth expectations, rape allegations are up in England and Wales; land disputes are triggering cast violence in India. A message from her partner: hey, did you make that change to the household insurance cover? <em>No, not yet!</em> (And can’t you stop fucking bugging me even when I’m on the plane!) The safety announcement starts. A guy Ellie was at college with got involved in property development, someone was saying he’s got his own plane.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>At college she did a course on the Greeks and Romans, she hasn’t thought about the big sweep of history for ages. Why did her relationship with X run into the sand four years ago? Are these costing estimates right? She hasn’t had a moment to herself since she stepped out of the shower at 6.17am this morning. Since then, it’s been constant business. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s one of the many points where we feel: work has taken over. Things I’d like to be properly engaged with &#8211; including: my sister, pondering what I’m doing with my life, nature, reading novels &#8211; have been squeezed to the edges. Bluntly: work has ruined my life. It threatens my sanity, my relationships and my health. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Normally, we’d be expected to be a bit shamefaced at this point. Cracking up isn’t an acceptable thing to do. There’s a risk of sounding whiney, self-pitying or just a bit of a loser &#8211; not able to take the heat. We’re haunted by the idea that we should be able to juggle everything, with poise and good humour.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Our imaginations are haunted by the image of more competent types, perhaps Larry Page.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-200214-pageA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7674" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/PM-200214-pageA.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Media Summit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our own less satisfactory life must be due to our own failings. If we were cleverer, more efficient, more emotionally mature, more self-controlled … then everything would fall into place. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">HOW WORK THREATENS SANITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Personal troubles sometimes have big historical causes</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our own lives, we typically see problems close up. There are lots of details that are getting us down. There’s too much to do. You fly off the handle over little things. You worry about affording a house. Your partner is too demanding. You’re not sleeping very well. You might wonder what it is all for, but there isn’t much time to wonder these days. You feel guilty about not getting proper exercise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We encounter the symptoms. But it’s hard for us to see if there’s a powerful causal factor that lies behind these localised frustrations and annoyances. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We understand this distinction between symptoms and causes in medical situations: someone might have a pain in their big toe and dry peeling skin. The natural instinct is to think: there’s something very wrong with my toe, because that’s where the pain is occurring. But the problem isn’t caused there. There’s something wrong with their kidneys leading to a buildup of urate crystals in the toe joint.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-102726438.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-102726438.jpg?resize=635%2C568" alt="Housewife doing the laundry whilst smoking, 1954." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 1960s, feminism took off by making this same move: finding a big, underlying factor that explained a lot of personal gripes and annoyances. In the late 1950s, women across the US might think things like: my husband is a bit selfish; I wish I could have an interesting job and make decent money myself; I was a fool I should have worked harder at college, but I didn’t see the point at the time; I’m not even sure I want children &#8211; does that mean there’s something wrong with me? I feel frustrated every day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1963, Betty Friedan argued that all of these complaints &#8211; which could seem like merely individual personal grievances &#8211; were in fact symptoms of a bigger issue which up to this point people hadn’t identified: it was, in her words, &#8220;the problem that has no name.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning [that is, a longing] that women suffered in the middle of the 20th century in the United States. Each suburban housewife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries … she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question — &#8216;Is this all?'&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1971BettyMarch.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7677" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1971BettyMarch.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="1971BettyMarch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Betty Friedan: <em>it’s not you </em></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Betty Friedan reframed the issue: what’s going on isn’t really just a local difficulty with your life. It’s not something specific about your particular relationship or your career options. You are suffering from a big historical problem. And she gave it a name: Patriarchy. She was pointing out that women were feeling the effects of living in a society that had evolved to focus on male authority and opportunity. Women were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>being given access to a really big story about the origins of their sufferings (big and small). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe that the suffering of the lawyer on the plane (in whose troubles we all share to a greater or lesser extent) should also be attributed to a large historical cause. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this case, the problem lies with: <em>Modernism.</em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modernism is the name of a phenomenon that captivated artists and writers from the middle of the 19th century. Starting in Paris and spreading to Vienna, London and New York, architects, poets, painters and novelists started responding to the vast expansion of cities, the arrival of the railways, the huge increase in newspapers and the amount of advertising that was going on all around them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/La_Gare_Saint-Lazare.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7678" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/La_Gare_Saint-Lazare.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="La_Gare_Saint-Lazare" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, in its more ambitious forms, Modernism didn’t just reflect a new subject matter: painting busy streets rather than scenes from the bible or ancient history. Avant-garde artists started developing new styles &#8211; they changed <em>the way</em> they painted. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They went from highly-esteemed traditional works, like those of Claude Lorraine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>that emphasised harmony and balance </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ng_ng_ng61_large.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7679" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ng_ng_ng61_large.jpg?resize=635%2C664" alt="(c) The National Gallery, London; Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To things like Georges Braque’s 1913 <strong>Cubist</strong> still life: <em>Fruit Dish, Ace of Clubs</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Georges_Braque_1913_Nature_morte_Fruit_Dish_Ace_of_Clubs_oil_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas_81_x_60_cm_31.8_x_23.6_in_Musée_National_dArt_Moderne_Centre_Georges_Pompidou_Paris.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7682" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Georges_Braque_1913_Nature_morte_Fruit_Dish_Ace_of_Clubs_oil_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas_81_x_60_cm_31.8_x_23.6_in_Musée_National_dArt_Moderne_Centre_Georges_Pompidou_Paris.jpg?resize=635%2C625" alt="Georges_Braque,_1913,_Nature_morte_(Fruit_Dish,_Ace_of_Clubs),_oil,_gouache_and_charcoal_on_canvas,_81_x_60_cm_(31.8_x_23.6_in),_Musée_National_d'Art_Moderne,_Centre_Georges_Pompidou,_Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Braque and his colleague Picasso were in the process of inventing Cubism. Cubist works struck early viewers as hard to understand, as too busy and broken up. But Braque and Picasso weren’t setting out to annoy people. They were signalling that something very important was happening, that life was getting more agitated, more fragmented, more sharp-edged. They started making images that reflected just these qualities.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar changes were taking place at the same time in literature. Traditional narrative was leisurely and clear. A very successful traditional novelist like Anthony Trollope would take care to let the reader know about what was happening. Reading a Trollope novel would be a calm, comfortable experience; maybe very slightly tedious, but definitely reassuring. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Mr. Wharton was and had for a great many years been a barrister practising in the Equity Courts,—or rather in one Equity Court, for throughout a life&#8217;s work now extending to nearly fifty years, he had hardly ever gone out of the single Vice-Chancellor&#8217;s Court which was much better known by Mr. Wharton&#8217;s name than by that of the less eminent judge who now sat there. His had been a very peculiar, a very toilsome, but yet probably a very satisfactory life. He had begun his practice early, and had worked in a stuff gown till he was nearly sixty. At that time he had amassed a large fortune, mainly from his profession, but partly also by the careful use of his own small patrimony and by his wife&#8217;s money. Men knew that he was rich, but no one knew the extent of his wealth.&#8221; [Trollope: <em>The Prime Minister</em>] </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Literary Modernism rejected this approach. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/joyce_abbott.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7681" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/joyce_abbott.jpg?resize=400%2C500" alt="joyce_abbott" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In chapter seven of his novel <em>Ulysses</em> &#8211; first published as a whole in 1922 &#8211; James Joyce describes one of the main characters, Leopold Bloom, walking into a Dublin newspaper office: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;He pushed in the glass swingdoor and entered, stepping over strewn packing paper. Through a lane of clanking drums he made his way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">WITH UNFEIGNED REGRET IT IS WE ANNOUNCE THE DISSOLUTION OF A MOST RESPECTED DUBLIN BURGESS</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thumping. Thump. This morning the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam. Machines. Smash a man to atoms if they got him caught. Rule the world today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HOW A GREAT DAILY ORGAN IS TURNED OUT</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s the ads and side features sell a weekly, not the stale news in the official gazette. Queen Anne is dead. Published by authority in the year one thousand and. Demesne situate in the townland of Rosenallis, barony of Tinnahinch. To all whom it may concern schedule pursuant to statute showing return of number of mules and jennets exported from Ballina. Nature notes. Cartoons. Phil Blake&#8217;s weekly Pat and Bull story. Uncle Toby&#8217;s page for tiny tots.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Understandably, sceptical readers at first simply thought that Joyce was hopeless at telling a story. It’s hard to follow what’s going on: it seems to be a jumble of stray thoughts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In fact, he had a serious purpose: he was trying to reproduce what he saw as the chaos of modern experience. What’s going on inside our heads has become &#8211; he says &#8211; more like this: agitated, distracted, confusing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to consider Modernism as an artistic, cultural movement. We need to rediscover it as something useful to us on the flight home, something that reflects the most troubling aspects of our inner lives in the contemporary world. Artists like Joyce and Braque are tracking a development that’s still going on in our own lives: the loss of serenity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three deep causes of this loss of serenity: busy-ness, competition and envy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism One: Busy-ness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we’re expected to be always on the job. The idea of having precisely defined working hours no longer feels normal or natural. Essentially, you are not at work when work can reach you. If you can’t get out of range, you can’t ever really be away from work. Busy-ness depends upon how easy it is to get a claim on your attention and make a demand. Busyness has been increasing for centuries because of developments in the technology of access. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In early 18th-century Scotland, you might turn up in mid-summer at someone’s house &#8211; hoping to get them to do some work for you &#8211; only to be informed that they had ‘gone to London’ and that they would be ‘back by Christmas’. But if there was anything urgent that needed doing, you could always travel ten days and nights in a coach in pursuit of them. Or you could send a letter: it would take 110 hours and cost two-shillings &#8211; two days average wages. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But soon things got faster and cheaper. Technology got more sophisticated. By 1840, a letter would only take 33 hours and cost a penny (about GBP 5 today). However, if your quarry had gone overseas, they would be out of reach for weeks or months. At least, until 1866 when the first successful telegraph cable was laid across the Atlantic; though if they went to Australia they were safe until October 1872. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telex.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7684" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Telex.jpg?resize=635%2C587" alt="Telex" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the 1930s onwards, the telex meant that work could follow you. Extensive documents and files could follow you round the globe, so you would never have the excuse of not having the relevant material to hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>But the telex system was expensive and required special operators so there were restrictions on its use.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By 1993, email solved those problems &#8211; reducing the cost of communication to almost zero. Though you could very reasonably say that you didn’t get the email because you were on a train, at the airport or because you had stepped out of the office to have lunch. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Until 2007, that is, when the smartphone became mainstream. There are now few moments when one is legitimately beyond reach: in the shower perhaps &#8211; though there are very good waterproof cases. Or you could spend time in Big Bend National Park in Texas, where there is, as yet, almost no satellite coverage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/826597.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7685" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/826597.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="826597" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The history of communications can be told as a success story, of course. But it is also the record of the gradual conquest of privacy. We used to be protected by the impediments. People simply couldn’t make demands on us &#8211; not matter how much they might have wanted to. We’re not used to thinking of what the upside of impediments used to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism Two: Competition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Obviously, competition is a key feature of the modern economy. Competition has been fostered by governments around the world because of the benefits it typically brings to customers and consumers: lower prices and a wider range of products. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 20th century, the most influential advocate of Competition was the Austrian economist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Friedrich Hayek. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Friedrich_Hayek.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7686" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Friedrich_Hayek.jpg?resize=635%2C564" alt="Friedrich_Hayek" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The intellectual architect of glitzy malls</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Competition is designed to benefit the customer, rather than the company. And the reward is that when we go to buy things, we are offered lower prices and a wider range of options. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cost comes in our working lives. Greater competition makes companies fight to win sales. Customers should be very fickle. They should have a lot of choice and be very willing to go with the better deal, wherever it comes from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Companies have to strive to lower their prices or offer better, more enticing products. A firm that stands still will be overtaken by a more innovative or more efficient rival. Competition &#8211; ideally &#8211; keeps profits in check. If a firm has a bumper year and makes a big profit that should send a clear invitation to rival firms to move in, undercut, reduce the margins. A so-called efficient market really means one where it becomes ever more challenging to make a profit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Internal competition in companies makes employees compete against one another. The successful may be well rewarded but there’s a permanent cull of the less efficient. And competition should also mean that many companies fail. A really efficient marketplace should be a really stressful place to work &#8211; because you’re always afraid of going out of business.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3979173651_a1afca6b86_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7688" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3979173651_a1afca6b86_z.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="3979173651_a1afca6b86_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have bought our happiness as consumers at the price of ourselves as producers. We had the option of running the economy for the sake of the worker or the consumer. The idea of ourselves as consumers dominated over the image of ourselves as workers. The huge collateral cost is that everyone at work is stressed. Efficiency brings anxiety, punishing hours and insecurity into the workplace. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things that are familiar tend to feel natural. But actually it’s very odd that people in executive jobs are working so hard. History reminds us how much beyond the normal level we are operating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The philosopher John Stuart Mill worked in London for a vastly powerful business &#8211; the East India Company &#8211; from 1823 to 1858. He was mainly involved in policy formation and finished his career in one of the most senior roles: his job title was ‘The Examiner’. It was a highly responsible position; Mill was often required to give evidence on behalf of the Company before Parliamentary Committees. And he was very well paid. The job carried a salary of GBP 2000 &#8211; more than 20 times the average income. But while employed by the East India Company, Mill also managed to write some major and highly influential<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>philosophical works &#8211; including, amongst many others, two monumental works:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>A System of Logic</em> (1843) and <em>The Principles of Political Economy</em> (1848). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mill was able to do all this because most afternoons, the East India Company’s offices were quiet. He could sit at his desk and get on with his own projects. Nobody was angry with him for doing so. If anything they were impressed by his work ethic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-173340148.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7689" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-173340148.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="John Stuart Mill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">John Stuart Mill by Gilbert Keith Chesterton. The accompanying verse reads &#8220;John Stuart Mill / By a mighty effort of will / Overcame his natural bonhomie / And wrote &#8216; Principles of Political Economy.&#8221;</h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Stuart Mill</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">By an effort of will</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Abandoned his natural bonhomie</span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">And wrote on Political Economy </span></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">[The image and verse [improved by us] are by GK Chesterton; Getty images]</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In his report for the UK government’s 1864 School Enquiry Commission, the poet and civil servant Matthew Arnold advised the adoption in England of the workload for teachers in France: &#8220;A teacher at a French Lycée has his three four or five hours a day in lessons and conferences, then he is free.&#8221; He was specifically arguing against the practice in the England of school teachers working a few hours a week on top of this, supervising games. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arnold and Mill &#8211; who were immensely respectable figures &#8211; show us that it was completely normal in the professional world of the mid-19th century to work around 20 hours a week. These were not people who were lazy or marginal in their careers. They used their free time in very constructive and ambitious ways. That’s why it was possible for the leading philosopher to be in business and for one of the major poets to work as a senior administrative officer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caricature-of-matthew-arnold.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7690" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/caricature-of-matthew-arnold.jpg?resize=527%2C514" alt="caricature-of-matthew-arnold" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Matthew Arnold &#8211; famous for taking it easy, writing poetry &#8211; and for reforming the education system</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In some ways, we are simply unlucky to be living at this moment of intense commercial competition. In general, the idea of historical bad luck makes a lot of sense: people’s lives just happen to get played out against the background of huge events. 1938 was an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>unfortunate time to turn 21.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TGSE00788.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7691" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/TGSE00788.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="TGSE00788" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Good natured sympathetic innocence meeting with a really horrible historical movement</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We understand that certain times were hard. The challenge today isn’t so concentrated and dramatic. But when you notice the difference between the life of Stuart Mill and us, it is extraordinary (that’s before we even mention housing and what a middle-class salary would have bought in London then and now). Mill and Arnold were able to hold down very good, high-level jobs for many years, but they faced nothing like the pressure and anxiety we have to live with. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just that a particular firm is very demanding or that one’s own shortcomings lead to weariness and insecurity:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>it’s the larger dynamic of market capitalism. Competition is why lunch for the lawyer on the plane usually means two minutes for a sandwich at the desk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Modernism Three: Comparison, Envy and Disappointment</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle ages, if you lived in Bristol (which was then a busy but small sea port), you probably wouldn’t know much about what was happening in London, Paris or the royal courts of Spain. Less urgent information might simply never circulate around the country: that the ladies at court like to gather their hair up in net bags either side of their face; that they like red gauntlets sewn with pearls in floral patterns. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7692" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363.jpg?resize=635%2C610" alt="456fbbd485d3ca3005b40a900a0dc363" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Blanche of Lancaster &#8211; wife of Henry IV &#8211; was the best dressed woman in late 14th-century England. But she couldn’t be<em> fashionable</em> &#8211; because it took too long for people to find out about what she was wearing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The daughter of a well-to-do merchant in Bristol might take a great deal of interest in clothes, but she couldn’t compare herself with the grander ladies of London like Blanche &#8211; because she simply didn’t know what they were up to. And, in any case, Blanche hardly seemed to belong to the same species. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, in August 1770, the first edition of the <em>Lady’s Magazine</em> appeared. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7693" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e.jpg?resize=635%2C545" alt="2dd5b6b92d8c4105ab47b8f70c17c03e" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every month it carried detailed illustrations of what the most prestigious women were wearing. So news about bonnets and high waists could circulate rapidly. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Satellite.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7694" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Satellite.jpg?resize=635%2C601" alt="No. 4. 1811 London Fashionable Morning &amp; Evening Dress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone reading it could at last compare their own clothes with those of the rich and well-connected in London. And so they were provided with the opportunity of experiencing a novel emotion: the feeling of being left out by history, by fashion, by everyone. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Up until then you could be left out, of course &#8211; but only by people who you knew, who lived around you. Your cousins didn’t take you berry-picking; the vicar didn’t ask you to dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The magazine, however, presented itself as revealing what every lady in the land was was wearing &#8211; except you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Actually ‘the Lady’ was not the disembodied voice of the spirit of the age speaking with universal authority. It was mainly concocted by a man called John Coote in a dusty little office, in an unprepossessing corner of London. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The new media of the 18th century was also teaching men the pains of missing out and being left behind: a yeoman farmer could learn from <em>The Spectator</em> that he was a clodhopper; <em>The Tatler</em> encouraged a local squire to recognise himself as a dull provincial. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The growth of modern technology created the opportunity for comparison. It needed better roads, more efficient printing, the use of special-coloured inks, an effective postal service to get a copy of the <em>Lady’s Magazine</em> into the hands of people in Newcastle and Exeter. And comparison opened the way to envy and disappointment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 18th century was introducing the world to the distinctive modern experience of comparison. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7695" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263.jpg?resize=400%2C570" alt="Sunday-Times-Style-Magazine-Cover-15.01-e1329304509263" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Officially, we are simply finding out about the world: we are informing ourselves about the lives of others &#8211; their style and achievements. We evolved as social creatures living in large groups: we’re<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>primed by nature to be very interested in social hierarchies. It seem innocuous: an article about the most chic ski resort in Europe; a photo shoot of a young woman with amazingly beautiful legs; the new trend for rooftop lap-pools and a profile of how Uber’s Travis Kalanick made his billions. It’s just information about what’s happening around the world, but what it’s doing in our head is very harmful. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Envy is dependent on knowledge and hope. We only envy things that feel as if they are within our reach. Yet the world of the magazine is highly selective. In the magazine, ‘everyone’ is fashionable, everyone seems to have plenty of money, is aged between 18 and 25 and has a perfectly-shaped nose. Our natural instinct for comparison goes haywire as a result. By the standards of the magazine world, we are barely acceptable, we are on the lowest rung. We come away with a nagging sense of being plain, dowdy and short of cash. The life we lead &#8211; which used to seem fine &#8211; now looks so disappointing, because it compares so unfavourably with the picture of existence conjured up in the media. And so we are required to continually fight an internal battle staving off the envy and humiliation provoked by overexposure to the lives of the freakishly successful and beautiful few.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">History dignifies our problems </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking at three big factors in Modernism &#8211; the rise of busy-ness, the growth of competition and the vast increase in the circulation of envy-inducing information &#8211; shows that our problems around work are not the result of personal failings. This doesn’t make the problem go away. What it does is transform its meaning. History helps us reframe what we’re going through. It guides the re-interpretation of our own experience. You understand your problem in non-hysterical, non-panicky ways. There are three specific consolations of history: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It depersonalises</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However intimate it all feels -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>the exhaustion, the relationship tension, the build up of demands, the ever increasing expectations &#8211; the fact is that one is not alone. Because these troubles arise out of big historical factors, they are necessarily going to be very widespread. You belong to a community of people who have this problem. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">It shifts the direction of blame </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us not to shout at the wrong person. It’s not your fault. And it’s not just some stupid managerial issue that’s getting you down. We can grasp why the problem won’t go away quickly or easily &#8211; why just changing jobs or getting divorced won’t necessarily solve the issue. History offers an insight into potentially mitigating factors around work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Participation in the Grandeur of History </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real root of your problem is not the Frankfurt contracts, it’s this high-cultural issue known as Modernism. In general, we understand how much it can mean to people to see themselves in grand historical terms. Mourners at the funeral of Winston Churchill &#8211; which took place at the end of January 1965 &#8211; knew they were recognising more than the death of a single individual. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7696" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="tumblr_nizyv8q6sD1s57vgxo2_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were collectively witnessing the passing of an epoch. The Grandeur of History isn’t only about positive things which are shared. There is grandeur in recognising the scale of the collective traumas we go through together; they are so much bigger than us; they set the stage on which we lead our lives, we have no control over them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We haven’t yet raised all the monuments we need: </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Arc de Triomphe gets us to see the grandeur of the huge, painful transformation of France during the Revolution.

We need Arcs to: the heroes of Media Saturation and to Those Whose Leisure has been Sacrificed in the Age of Competition. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OUR WORK &amp; OUR PARTNERS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work threatens to blow up our relationships. There are four key complaints that signal the mounting levels of tension. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint One: If you loved me, you wouldn’t work so hard</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So often, work has a difficult impact on relationships. (Though the absence of work can be even worse). There’s a long list of complaints: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you’re never around</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you’re always tired</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– I never get you full attention; you’re obsessive; your work always comes first (I wanted to watch an episode of <em>House of Cards</em> with you at 10pm and you were still bashing away at a report) </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– you come back stressed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The Ideology of Romanticism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we tend to see our relationships in terms that were invented mainly in the late 18th century.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The Romantic ideology of love emphasises: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– monogamy, sex as the expression of love</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– candour, the sharing of all secrets</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– the need to understand one another</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– the importance of doing things together all the time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These ideas were revolutionary when they were introduced. And they were introduced by very particular kinds of people: who were young, leisured, well-off. Romanticism was invented on long summer evenings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/517715075_f829f4f414_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7701" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/517715075_f829f4f414_z.jpg?resize=635%2C321" alt="517715075_f829f4f414_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The main manual of Romanticism &#8211; the book that more than any other taught people how to think of love in this way &#8211; was <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em>. It was written by the German poet and philosopher Goethe, when he was in his mid-twenties. It tells the story of Werther’s love for Charlotte. He meets her at a dance and falls in love with her. Every emotional shift is described in compelling detail: the thrill of looking into her eyes, the agony that she does not love him back, the desperate longing to see her again after every parting, the moments of transcendent tenderness. For thirty years it was the most famous novel in the world (Napoleon read it seven times). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As his love for Charlotte grows, Werther is not distracted by the demands of a job. At one point, Werther describes how he usually passes the morning &#8211; before going over to Charlotte’s place for the afternoon and evening. </span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Werter reading to Charlotte. He was next expected at work in two-and-a-half years</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a while Werther does have a job: he takes up a rather undemanding post as a diplomat. But for months on end he’s free to do as he likes. It’s not a coincidence. Romantic love began as a full time undertaking. It was invented as a privileged, leisured experience. The ideal romantic couple would spend all their time together, they would spend hours talking about every detail of their emotional lives, they would always be going on long walks together in the evening. And the point of getting married would be to be able to do this more and more. Any reduction in the time spent together or lessening of the level of openness would be experienced in very alarming terms: it would begin to signal the death of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Romanticism meets Modern Capitalism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romanticism and Capitalism are the two dominant system of ideas of our time: they guide the way we think and feel about the two things the usually matter most in our lives: relationships and work. But combining Romanticism and Modern Capitalism together is very, very difficult. It’s a hugely unfortunate historical clash. We live under two very powerful, but oddly incompatible systems. The impressive idea of Romantic love &#8211; with its ideals of closeness and openness &#8211; sits badly with the way work takes up so much of our time, fills our heads with complex demands and makes it very hard to switch off; and the insecurity around so much work makes it very hard to feel relaxed about taking things easy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The aristocratic tradition of marriage </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern view of work should ideally have been married up with the view of relationships that predominated in the French and English aristocracy up until the end of the 18th century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7702" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children.jpg?resize=635%2C504" alt="johann-closterman-john-churchill-1st-duke-of-marlborough-and-sarah-duchess-of-marlborough-with-their-children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A happy unromantic couple: John (far left) and Sarah (middle) with their children</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The John 1st Duke and Sarah Duchess of Marlborough had a very strong marriage. They were the most successful economic and political couple in early 18th-century Europe, whose partnership took them from obscure poverty to vast wealth and power. But they spent long periods apart. Neither one was particularly surprised if they didn’t see the other for six months. And the idea of sexual fidelity did not apply. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Their expectations of a relationship were clear, limited and pragmatic. They would produce legitimate heirs. They would secure mutual prosperity and assist each other’s careers. They could have moments of great loyalty and closeness &#8211; but it wasn’t an everyday thing. They were not expected to share the same bedroom, or even live in the same house all the time. They weren’t continually complaining about not spending enough time together or about being too occupied with work. But nor were they doing something strange and unusual. The way they lived was conventional and acceptable. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t realise to what an extent our feelings are guided by our sense of what is normal and of what we should expect from others. We are highly flexible creatures, but with a generally strong desire to fit in. There are many ways we could be living fine &#8211; if we had time to adjust and enough social support. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a revolution in marriage &#8211; from the current Romantic version to an updated version of the pragmatic, work-aligned<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>aristocratic idea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint Two: I don’t know what’s on your mind</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic vision of love is very keen on candour and sharing: according to the Romantic ideal, your lover is sensitive to and understands your moods and thoughts: you finish each other’s sentences; each knows what the other has on their mind. It can be a very attractive idea &#8211; but the level of communicative openness it assumes is at odds with the realities of a lot of modern work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It’s hard to explain what’s going on at work</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s hard to get your partner to really understand what your experience is like (and they may very likely be feeling the same way about you and their work). After a tricky day (or a tricky week) the tension has built up; the worries are circulating, work-related ideas fill one’s mind. All this preoccupation expresses itself in a range of not very endearing symptoms: grunting, sighing, brooding silence and a short-fused temper. The most innocuous sounding question ’how was your day?’ can elicit a growl or an explosion; a tiny irritation at home feels like this: one is already filled up with stress and irritation; a single drop more and a spill is inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One’s partner has to endure these symptoms without the real cause being properly explained. They can’t see all the stuff that is in the glass already. We find it extremely hard to lay out what has actually been going on at work in such a way that would lead the other person to understand what we’re going though &#8211; and therefore feel a degree of sympathy for our volatile state. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we find it extremely difficult to undertake the expected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>explanation. It’s not really our fault. There are several big reasons why this is the case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Description in general is hard </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work isn’t unusual in being hard to describe. The fact that something is very familiar to you doesn’t mean it is at all easy to put into words what it is like or what is going on. Bicycle gears are totally rational mechanisms for controlling the relationship between the speed the pedals are rotating at and the speed the wheels are turning. Describing in detail what is going on is fiendishly difficult (and very boring).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closeup_bicycle_gears_alex.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7704" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/closeup_bicycle_gears_alex.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="closeup_bicycle_gears_alex" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Impossible to put into words: like so much of work</h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Previously expectations of communication were much lower</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that explanation is tricky didn’t matter so much when expectations were low. When work was strongly divided on gender lines, there was often an assumption that work wouldn’t be much discussed at home, in a domestic setting. Family life was where the worker left work behind. The family didn’t feel shut out. It felt natural and therefore totally acceptable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in any case, jobs were often much simpler and their basic character was well understood by everyone. If you were a shepherd, a blacksmith, a miner or a housemaid, you were doing work that had been deeply familiar to everyone in the community for many generations. The advent of the factory system in the early 19th century brought new kinds of work &#8211; but often whole communities would be employed in roughly the same industries, so everyone would understand what it was like to glaze pottery (if you lived in Staffordshire) or operate a steam loom (if you lived around Manchester). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today’s jobs are weirder and more strangely specialised. You might be </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– advising on restructuring the billing system for an NHS trust; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a senior order entry specialist scheduling shipments to customers; </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– involved in the operational management of health and welfare benefit programs;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– a technical manager with extensive experience in IBM Data Collection suite, including Dimensions, with a track record in leading systems transformation projects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instructively, grown-up characters in children’s books rarely have such jobs. They are still more likely to be farmers, deliver the post or have a grocery stall at the local market &#8211; work that is essentially pre-modern. This tiny detail of modern publishing has a larger meaning: it’s a signal that we know that it’s very hard to explain modern jobs to a child, or indeed anyone else. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One’s work situation is changing fast… </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work is often like a fast moving, many stranded soap opera, with revolving characters and volatile themes. Keeping one’s partner on board would require constant updating:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘The other Sarah &#8211; not the one I was telling you about yesterday who had the fight with the New York office over the legal reforms in Argentina, but the<em> other</em> one &#8211; who I mentioned two weeks ago when she was trying to get Ted &#8211; remember Ted? &#8211; to take Alison off the review committee. You’re with me? So, other Sarah was suggesting that I rejig the approach to the Générale Occidentale account. For once, she’s actually got a point. But it means I’m going to be working late on Tuesday. Now, let me fill you in on the apparently subtle, but actually fundamental, shift in our strategy toward the French financial services sector&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Explaining properly -<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>about why one day was more demanding than another, why a particular project is so stress-inducing or why the relationship with certain people involves special degrees of angst &#8211; would require immense levels of patience on both sides. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It would help if… </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">There was general acknowledging that the explanatory task is very difficult. </span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Theoretical physicists have it easy to the extent that everyone admits that their work is important and yet bafflingly difficult for outsiders to understand. If we don’t understand we don’t blame them. We humbly admit it’s all just too complicated. We need this tolerance to spread more widely. So that one could comfortably say things like: ‘my partner is in logistics; of course their work is too complex for me to understand properly.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Art could take up some of the burden</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In late 19th century England, the best understood work was that of a country vicar. This was due not to the simplicity of their work (it was actually quite complicated) but to the great efforts to explain it undertaken by the most accomplished novelists of the age. George Eliot and Anthony Trollope wrote numerous highly successful and highly accomplished works detailing the working lives of the Church of England clergy. They explained in great detail (but in ways that won them huge audiences) the secret pains and quiet triumphs of such work.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Anthony Trollope &#8211; the leading 19th-century writer of entertaining novels &#8211; was determined to make the world understand the day-to-day working lives of Anglican vicars</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We haven’t yet seen this happen around more typical modern employment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint: I have to do all the shit work around here/I’m tired of picking up your socks</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the ways work is at odds with domestic life is expressed via intemperate conversations about who cleans the loo. (Or takes out the rubbish, or renews the household insurance or cleans the fridge.) It’s partly because when people are busy with job work there’s less time and energy left over for work around the house. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>The modern ideology of work assigns the domestic sphere a low status</em>. Work around the house isn’t paid, and that means it can’t be important. And it’s associated, historically, with socially subordinate positions: the scullery maid, the footman. So, we tend not to take household management seriously. We don’t give it patient and serious thought. We’re not used to recognising and admiring the relevant skills. (We admire people who can drive fast, but not those who can make a bed perfectly at high-speed.) In Modernity, paid work has sucked up all the prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>And our Romantic ideas about love are also not very concerned with household management</em>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dicksee-romeo_and_juliet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7709" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/dicksee-romeo_and_juliet.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="dicksee-romeo_and_juliet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">No one is worrying about who dusted the shelves</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our Romantic ideology privileges emotion over household management. It’s the intensity of the feeling the couple has for each other that counts &#8211; not the extent to which they can co-operate around cleaning the bathroom or managing the household accounts. If one were to ask is vacuuming more romantic than a weekend in Paris the answer &#8211; supposedly is too obvious to be worth giving. And yet a collaborative attitude to cleaning rugs is a better indicator of the health of a relationship than a shared interest in bars in the troisième. The irony is we play down the domestic as if it didn’t matter &#8211; yet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>actually this is where things so often get very fraught in relationships. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">An unfortunate historical moment … </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We live at a moment that is quite odd by historical standards: a period when pretty much everyone is involved (even if only a little) in housework. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we tend to think of the idea of having a servant as an ultra-high end luxury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/contents-butler.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7710" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/contents-butler.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Room Service" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But for large swathes of humanity, very large numbers of people in fact employed other people to help them domestically. In 1850 in the UK, for example, families with an income of GBP 300 a year (the basic income of any managerial job) would typically have two live-in servants. A clerk on half that (GBP 150 a year) would usually employ a full-time maid. Even just renting a room almost always meant having a shared servant. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The domestic service sector really came to an end because there were more productive things for people to do. In the most productive economies it has become prohibitively expensive to employ a fellow citizen to live in your house and make you cups of tea, dust the mantlepiece and clean the bath taps. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in the future, it is unlikely that there will be much domestic work for people to do (unless they want to do it for fun). The technological developments of the 1950s and 1960s – the vacuum cleaners and dishwashers and tumble driers – made domestic work a bit less cumbersome, but they didn’t bring it to an end. The long-promised robotic servants who really would take domestic chores out of our hands haven’t arrived yet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-008438AE00000258-160_468x306.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7711" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/article-0-008438AE00000258-160_468x306.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="F-CTF19313" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, of course, they will become standard &#8211; eventually. They might be cheap and common by 2050. So there will have been a gap period from about 1950 to 2050 where domestic work was neither the province of servants nor of robots. A century is nothing in the big sweep of history. It’s just odd and very challenging that we happen to be living in it at the moment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Complaint: You’re too busy for me</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both partners are tired and depleted. She wants him to see her friends. He wants her to do some complicated sexual thing. They’re too tired to please each other. And they each have what feels like a justified point of complaint against the other: you’re too busy for me. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> People feel guilty; they feel they should go to bed earlier. Perhaps if they took magnesium supplements, they’d feel more perky. But the real cause is probably just work: too much, too demanding, too relentless. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> We’ve been very reluctant to admit that the demands of certain areas of high-pressure modern work might really not be very compatible with having a relationship. In order to get on efficiently with other tasks, you probably shouldn’t be trying to have a relationship and possibly raise a family as well. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which raises a question that sounds deeply strange to us: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Might you really need to be celibate to do certain jobs? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For much of history, the question was taken very seriously &#8211; and quite often the answer was a definite ‘yes’. A whole range of jobs were seen as incompatible with relationships. They weren’t necessarily saying you need to be chaste and avoid sex; it was the demands on time and the emotions that was the real focus of concern. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">St Hilda of Whitby was one of the most powerful and accomplished women in the early history of England.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7712" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/StHilda.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="StHilda" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was a very senior administrator, running large agricultural enterprises; she was a management consultant to kings and princes. She was a leading educationalist. And she did all this while being noted for her good temper. Of course, she was unmarried. It’s not that because she was a nun she wasn’t allowed to get married and so had to make the best of her work opportunities without a supportive home life. The line of thought ran the other way round. She was able to have a stellar career and achieve so much for the community because she was free of the demands of relationships and domestic life. Being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>a nun meant she lived in an efficient collective household &#8211; she would be supplied with meals, laundry and heating without having to organise everything for herself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It was an approach to certain kinds of work &#8211; intellectual, administrative and cultural &#8211; that persisted for many centuries. In 1900, academia in the UK was still almost entirely a career for the unmarried.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7713" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/201011-formal-hall-big.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="201011-formal-hall-big" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Fellows of King’s College, Cambridge in 1900: not being married was one of the job requirements</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The view was that certain kinds of jobs require such effort and continuous devotion and they loom so large in your imagination that you really shouldn’t try to combine them with the duties of a relationship, a family and looking after your own home. To do them properly, you should live in very well-organised commune (like a monastery or a college), you should be single and you should socialise mainly with people who are involved in the same kind of work, because they will understand you and also be able to help you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This reminds us that we’re asking ourselves to do lots of complicated things at once. No wonder we squabble, feel resentment and the occasional burst of despair. We think it should be easy, if you’re a half-decent person, to be a success at work and an excellent domestic partner. But your job requires so much effort. Your sneaking background suspicion that someone who does your job might be too busy to empty the bins or make the bed could actually just be true. You deserve a lot of sympathy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CHILDREN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Accompanied by a discrete but substantial security detail, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, likes to take his daughter Florence to nursery school a few blocks from Number 10.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally, he’d do it every day. But the demands on his diary make it a rare event. </span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Sadly, a special occasion</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Historically, it is very odd for Prime Ministers &#8211; or indeed anyone with an executive role &#8211; to spend much of their day attending to the needs of their own children.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>People weren’t heartless, they just didn’t think that it was particularly good for children to spend a lot of time with their parents. Many people feared ‘spoiling’ their children by overt displays of affection. In fact, it wasn’t until the early 1950s that this view started to change dramatically. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> A number of researchers in the area of child development &#8211; especially an English doctor and psychoanalyst, John Bowlby &#8211; stressed the importance of continuous and close relationships with parents. He demonstrated the value of a warm, reassuring parental figure for the good development of the child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Bowlby.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7716" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Bowlby.jpg?resize=635%2C627" alt="John-Bowlby" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;All the cuddling and playing, the intimacies of suckling by which a child learns the comfort of his mother’s body, the rituals of washing and dressing by which through her pride and tenderness towards his little limbs he learns the values of his own…&#8221;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Such experiences teach a basic trust: that difficulties can be managed; that slip-ups are only that and can be put right, that we are naturally entitled to be treated with kindness and consideration, without having to do anything to earn this and without having to make special pleas or demands. &#8220;It is as if maternal care were as necessary for the proper development of personality as vitamin D for the proper development of bones.&#8221;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He didn’t mean for it to happen, but Bowlby’s insights into the principles of child development opened a new landscape of pain for modern parents. One is upset and worried about not making it back in time to read for bed. A tender part of us has been awakened and now aches.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31.jpg?resize=400%2C337" alt="300px-Duke_of_Normandy-31" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>\</p>
<h5 class="p1">Robert: unfazed by the number of unread stories</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it didn’t make Robert feel guilty or sad. Because in 11th-century Europe, being a very good father was not assessed in terms of quantity of contact. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the light of our improved understanding of the needs of the child, our vision of the decent parent has become much more demanding: a good parent devotes a lot of time and thought to their child, they are present at crucial moments. To be a good parent has become much more emotionally demanding than ever before. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our best &#8211; and very time consuming &#8211; ideas about how to raise a child have arrived on the scene at a very awkward moment. Because we’ve also discovered some crucial things about productivity and efficiency. Competitive, open markets have been astonishingly productive but they leave us challenged around time. Our best ideas about how to run an economy and our best ideas about how to raise families are completely at odds. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Against work-life balance </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finding a comfortable, harmonious balance between the demands of work and the needs of children is a very tantalising thought. It <em>sounds</em> like obviously such a good idea. And we can always find a few people in the world who seem to achieve it with ease &#8211; just as there are people who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>are good at high-wire cycling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/media-78819-282841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7718" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/media-78819-282841.jpg?resize=635%2C365" alt="media-78819-282841" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">There are also people who achieve work-life balance</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should understand that attempting to have &#8211; at the same time &#8211; a good home life and a good work life is an inescapably very difficult thing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s possible to pull it off: it does very rarely happen. But it’s very unlikely that you will be one of these people. We end up getting frustrated and angry with ourselves (and our partners) for failing to attain this very elusive condition. One might &#8211; with similar levels of justice &#8211; berate oneself for not combining a job in the accounts department of a supermarket chain with giving piano recitals at Grosser Musikvereinssaal in Vienna; or complaining that one’s partner is always failing to win vast sums in the Spanish lottery. It’s very unhelpful to imagine that we can have it all. Because even what are actually very worthy efforts look puny and disappointing by comparison. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The consoling thing is that the failure isn’t personal. It isn’t one’s own incompetence or lack of drive that sets work and home life at odds. We just happen to be living at a point in history where two big, opposed themes are very powerful. We have demanding ideas about the needs of families and relationships and we have demanding ideas about work, efficiency, profit and competition. Both are founded in crucial insights. It’s not our fault that they are opposed. But it does mean that we deserve a high dose of sympathy for the very tricky situation we happen to find ourselves in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For untold generations work was simply a matter of maintaining the status quo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/june.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7720" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/june.jpg?resize=635%2C624" alt="june" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Très riches heures (June)</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those who laboured in the fields might have had marginally better or worse years. But no matter how diligently they raked or with how much skill they wielded the scythe, they could never essentially change their lot. That was decided by birth &#8211; and could not usually be changed by their own efforts, however great. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7721" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="2cb70321f01f0e1c8625e7103a688c99" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the whole of the 19th century, the greatest place of hope in the world was New York, because it held open a fundamental idea &#8211; which overturned the static condition of the farm workers: irrespective of where you had started you could &#8211; through work and a good character &#8211; attain a full measure of success and prosperity there. Unlike almost anywhere else in the world, where your prospects were largely determined by the chances of birth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In particular, it was capitalism which seemed to be the bringer of opportunity. Everyone was familiar with its less alluring sides: unemployment, huge factories. But what capitalism promoted was the idea of personal progress through a job. Competition and free markets would give opportunity to hard work and talent. You could rise. And prices would fall &#8211; competition for sales would lead to higher standards of living and lower costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flights.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7722" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flights.jpg?resize=440%2C299" alt="flights" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1" style="text-align: center;">The beautiful idea of capitalism … Careers and happiness open to all</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now everywhere is New York. In a couple of respects, capitalism has delivered on this promise. The prices of many goods have fallen. The kinds of lives we can lead, in material terms, has been transformed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Across the UK in 1930, the average family spent 55% of its income on food. In fact, around 5% of all income went just on that. Today, for a typical British family, around 10% of the weekly budget goes on food. And only about 0.5% of a family’s income goes on bread. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there are other ways in which the capitalist dream has not turned out as expected. It doesn’t deliver the level of satisfaction and contentment that was anticipated around work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Five factors of modern work experience undermine the promise of capitalism. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The necessary failure of ambition</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalism distributes ambitions very broadly and in a way very generously &#8211; but also very cruelly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whartonnow-fal03-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7723" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/whartonnow-fal03-1.jpg?resize=468%2C285" alt="whartonnow-fal03-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Graduates of the of Wharton School 2004 Executive MBA</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By many measures, the graduates of a decade or so ago have almost all done very well. They earn well above the national average income. They hold responsible positions. They fly business class. But these external measures are not ones which have most psychological force. We measure ourselves against those we feel are in our peer group and in the light of our highest hopes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By these standards, capitalism has a stern message to send to the graduates of the world’s leading business schools. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To have any chance of getting to the very top, you have to be absolutely determined to get there. You have to invest you time, your efforts, your soul in getting there. You have to really want it. But, that won’t be enough. Most of you will fail in this ambition. And you will be haunted by that failure. You will look at the photo and envy the few who made it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> It is a statistical law. The number of CEO positions is very limited. The number of graduates for elite business schools is quite large. Many people are competing very eagerly for the small number of prize jobs. Most must fail. They fail by a very high standard. But, since it is the standard set by their own ambition, it is the one they use to measure themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6835109847_9573610cce_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7724" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6835109847_9573610cce_z.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="6835109847_9573610cce_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s constant envy. There are a couple of people who make it through the regular cullings at McKinsey; there’s someone who is linked to one of the great startups and has made a significant fortune; there’s the person who’s had a great run as a staffer at the White House. In comparison your own career feels lacklustre. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At social gatherings you wince at the sight of the words on your own business card: Associate Vice-President: a title designed to sound big to outsiders. But insiders &#8211; like all your friends &#8211; know it means your career has stalled. You worry that your partner doesn’t fully respect you. When you got together, a few years ago, you both used to talk a lot about the future. Now it’s as if your partner is avoiding the topic of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>The dreams invested in you &#8211; by your family, your earlier self &#8211; haven’t come true. You feel ashamed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to laugh at people without much money who hope to win the lottery. The desire to win makes sense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>- obviously. It’s just that the statistics are grim. They’re shooting at a tiny, very distant target. Failure is almost inevitable. But there’s an executive class version of this. And yet ambition &#8211; the hope of doing well in work &#8211; isn’t an optional add on. It’s actually central to how capitalism works: companies require all this competition for the top places; it needs a lot of people to aim much higher than they can achieve. For a few to succeed and be effective, many must try and fail. Collective efficiency is won at the price of many frustrated lives. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We have to abandon many version of who we could be</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1845 &#8211; when modern capitalism was moving into a higher gear, its most famous critic put a finger on one of its drawbacks, and dreamed of an ideal solution: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.&#8221; [</span>Marx,<em> German Ideology</em>, 1845]</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marx was tapping into a widespread longing. Each person has so much potential. The key exemplar &#8211; in Marx’s own lifetime &#8211; of the full human life was Goethe: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stieler_Goethe.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7725" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Stieler_Goethe.jpg?resize=635%2C472" alt="Stieler_Goethe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He was an individual who seemed to have fully explored the range of his ambition and longing &#8211; who had been married and had a family, but who also had a wildly adventurous romantic and sexual life; who had travelled and made a wonderful home; who had been a poet and thinker, but also a diplomat government minister, and political advisor, who had made discoveries in science. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Goethe is the grown-up, high-cultural version of a widespread instinct. Before they have much understanding of the reality of work, a child will typically lay out a long list of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>‘what I’d like to be when I grow up’: an astronaut, inventor, bus driver, champion trampoliner, model, doctor, explorer… Every one of these jobs has spoken to some part of the child’s identity. But the kind of life Goethe led (and that a child might want) has become ever more unusual. The ideal rounded, Renaissance individual has come ever more into conflict with the ideology of modern work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our hopes of a full life establish a standard by which we are almost certain to fail. It’s a harsh truth: we are all likely to die with significant, lovely parts of ourselves unexplored. Some of the best parts of our potential will remain undeveloped. Our best plans and projects will largely go unrealised. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Capitalism requires specialisation and devotion. So in order to survive and get on in a competitive, market-oriented economy, we‘re going to have to be very selective about the things we focus on, and we&#8217;re going to have to give huge quantities of time (huge parts of our lives) to these things. As a society, we benefit if someone has put 25,000 hours into dental hygiene or 36,000 hours into data entry systems &#8211; but the personal cost is the loss of all the other things we might have done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>or been. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can dream of so much more than we will ever be able to live out. Every day we will be reminded of what has had to be sacrificed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: It is impossible to be calm</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For much of western history, it would have been unthinkable to have had a major industry concerned with calming people down. Early nights, nothing going on, simple routines repeated day after day were not needed as special solutions to anxiety because they were, for so many people, the normal condition of everyday life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/131_MIS-scottish-croft-full.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7726" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/131_MIS-scottish-croft-full.jpg?resize=635%2C301" alt="131_MIS-scottish-croft-full" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Where everyone (almost) lived until the day before yesterday, historically speaking. Reducing stimulation was not necessary.</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s only when &#8211; as now &#8211; that anxiety and agitation are omnipresent in our lives that we built up a big collective interest in the search for tranquility. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This search started to take off at much the same time as the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, when towns were growing rapidly and factories springing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Increasingly, people started to delight in the idea that far away, in some new and unspoilt portion of the world, they could find true ease and relaxation. They could get away from the mounting pressure of home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The 18th-century artist William Hodges was especially taken by the calming aspects of the island of Tahiti (first visited by westerners only in 1768). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hodges_waterfall-tahiti.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7727" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Hodges_waterfall-tahiti.jpg?resize=635%2C396" alt="Hodges_waterfall-tahiti" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such images speak to our longing for calm and ease &#8211; for a simple natural, unanxious life. You too could have this life &#8211; they say &#8211; but you’d have to go to Tahiti, which will take five months and you’ll probably be attacked by pirates on the way; and it may not be quite as Hodges portrays it when you get there. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Today a huge industry exists to get us to these places. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bora-bora-pearl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7728" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bora-bora-pearl.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="bora-bora-pearl" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A large part of the modern meaning of luxury is that you will be able to calm down; you will be less pressured; you will be able to switch off and get away from it all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is an attitude to travel entirely at odds with that which prevailed in earlier ages, when the purpose of travel was to seek stimulation, adventure. It never quite works. The luxury cabanas of the Maldives are the recipients of extraordinary amounts of frustration and angst.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not our fault that we are agitated. Calm and tranquility depend on the thought that one has enough for tomorrow, that the challenges of the next period are ones we already know how to meet: we feel calm because we feel secure. But the conditions of modern life make such a feeling of calm very elusive. So even if we do get the prosperity and advancement that capitalism promised, we still end up anxious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: The permanent existential crisis of business </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work intersects with a basic feature of the human condition: we make the wrong choices. The natural ideal of a choice &#8211; of course &#8211; is that you are fully informed about the significance of the various options. You can then select the one that best fits your needs. But the reality isn’t usually like this, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Existentialist philosophers &#8211; most notably Jean Paul Sartre &#8211; were keenly attentive to the fact that usually, when we chose, we don’t know anything like enough about the various options.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7729" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi.jpg?resize=400%2C561" alt="6a00d8341c858253ef00e54f46c6f48833-640wi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sartre: We’re forced to choose, even though we don’t actually know what’s the right thing to do</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We lack the relevant information and experience. And yet we have to make decisions that will have huge implications for our own lives &#8211; and the lives of others. Should we expand into the South Korean market? Is this the time for a large scale rebranding exercise? Do I resign if I don’t get this promotion? Should I take the job in New York &#8211; or take up the offer in Tangiers? If my partner’s career takes them to Germany, do I follow, or do we break up over this? If there are children, do I take on more work (to pay for things) or less work (to spend more time around them)? Should you try to get into the property market now, or wait for a correction? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life demands choices constantly, and we will by definition screw a great many up so that by the time you’ve reached 35, you will have made 150 big decisions, and 15 might be very, very wrong and you will be paying for this for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Put someone long enough on earth and they will, through no particular evil quality, tie themselves up in extraordinary knots. They will be assailed by regrets. They will be eaten up every day by the thought that if only they had acted differently 10 years ago, things would be much better today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_1825-1905_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_1862.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7730" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_1825-1905_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_1862.jpg?resize=635%2C561" alt="William-Adolphe_Bouguereau_(1825-1905)_-_The_Remorse_of_Orestes_(1862)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Orestes pursued by ‘the Furies’ of remorse and regret: an extreme image of a normal experience</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> a </span>theme that Greek tragic writers were sympathetic to. They thought that the key to dealing with it was to acknowledge the inevitability of regret. They didn’t think that if only we were smart and honest and well-intentioned we could get through life with few regrets and without the pangs of remorse. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were particularly taken with the life story of Oedipus. On a journey, the talented and ambitious Oedipus was stopped by people he thought were robbers. He struck out at their leader and killed him. What no one knew at the time time was that the man he killed was actually his father. Of course, if this had been clear, everything would have been different. What the Greeks so liked about the story was the sense that it wasn’t the fault of Oedipus. But much later when he finds out what he’s done he is, of course, tormented by guilt and sorrow. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a message we benefit from hearing quite often. Because what helps with regret is the knowledge that &#8211; in fact &#8211; every life is burdened by regret in some shape or form. The ‘regret-free life’ exists only in French cabaret songs.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7623" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg?resize=450%2C583" alt="5.Darwin as monkey.jpg- acr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin was mocked because he caused deep offence</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By saying that ‘we’re descended from Apes’, Darwin’s reminding us that we carry with us a lot of baggage. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>evolved (in the distant past) because certain characteristics<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>worked well in environments very different from the ones we live in today. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolution (via gene mutation and reproduction) works to a very, very slow clock; big changes take hundreds of generations, so it lags weirdly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>when there are rapid changes to the human context. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve evolved to have a strong liking for sweet things (which worked really well when the sweetest things around was a papaya or a banana &#8211; because IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, a craving for sweet things is a good guide to what will help you flourish. But IN OUR ENVIRONMENT a craving for sweet things takes you to things that are unhealthy. But because this is an evolved desire, it’s very, very hard to turn it off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-Geladas.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7733" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-Geladas.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="800px-Geladas" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We&#8217;ve evolved to be suited to this kind of life. Evolution means we’re going to be saddled with some very inconvenient but maddeningly deep-rooted tendencies</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, we’ve evolved so that at times of conflict we get aggressive. It’s brilliant if what you are afraid of is a bear-size hyena or a saber-toothed cat. But if what you are afraid of is psychologically complex:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>getting trapped on a project with a colleague who doesn’t understand you or worries about being taken for granted, then ideally you want to approach this anxiety with as much cool reason and patience as possible; evolution, however, is still dealing with the terrors of the savanna and so pumps up our panic levels to the maximum. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve evolved to have relatively short attentions spans and to be very easily distracted by brightly-coloured moving things. Which worked beautifully when we needed to be on the look out for snakes in the long grass &#8211; and which goes some way to explaining why Times Square is one of the biggest tourist attractions on the planet. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7734" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/800px-New_york_times_square-terabass.jpg?resize=636%2C424" alt="800px-New_york_times_square-terabass" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this jumpy, highly visual kind of mind is ill-adapted to much of the work we need to do day-to-day at work. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Work-005.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7735" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Work-005.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Work" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The lag in genetic evolution means that our brains are brilliantly adapted to the situation we used to be in; but are tragicomically mismatched to our modern environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Evolution tells us why we struggle to fit the huge demands of work into our lives. We are trying to get ourselves to do something that’s very hard for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It changes the scale of our troubles. Although so often it seems incredibly personal that one fails to combine work harmoniously with family life or with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>exercise or with maintaining old friendships, the charge should not really be laid primarily against oneself. The fault lies with something much larger than our own individual failings (real though those are). It lies with where we are in history, with the nature of the economy and in the slow pace of evolution.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">For most of human history, people haven&#8217;t believed that the world changes very much, or that change is ever very good. Stability and security have been the ideals. News used to spread slowly, technology hardly evolved, few people ever travelled and trades were handed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Les_Très_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_février.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6659" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Les_Très_Riches_Heures_du_duc_de_Berry_février.jpg?resize=635%2C615" alt="©Photo.

<h6>Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry Manuscript</h6>
<p>But today, all that has changed. Most people regard profound, widespread and frequent change as inescapable and a good thing too. Change is now strongly associated with progress. A dominant picture has evolved of what the properly modern person is supposed to be like: someone who not only accepts change but who seeks it out, embraces it, drives it. When Steve Jobs wanted to convince John Sculley, president of Pepsi-Cola, to become CEO of the (then) much smaller Apple &#8211; he is reported as having asked him: ‘Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?’</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_522695099.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6660" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_522695099.jpg?resize=635%2C452" alt="640px-Steve_Jobs_and_Bill_Gates_(522695099)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The word ‘change’, in that famous phrase, has a powerful resonance. To change the world, Jobs seemed to be implying, is the most important, most admirable and most worthwhile thing a person can do with their life. And yet, the logical question &#8211; why is this change meant to be so important &#8211; does not get much of a look in.</p>
<p>We live in a culture that is always encouraging us to change. The fashion industry, for instance, thrives on rapid shifts of preferences. It has to persuade us that what was great last year isn’t much good this year. A car manufacturer wants to get us to change to their latest model. A new restaurant hopes to get us to alter our dining habits. There are many forces at play, encouraging us to feel that change is good and exciting, not because this is always a major truth &#8211; but largely because business models requires it.</p>
<p>Change may be inevitable. But our relationship to change can be better or worse. We can use change well or we can be baffled and distressed by change. We can grow or diminish. This essay explores the four key problems that can occur around change &#8211; and what we can do about them.</p>
<p><strong>One: When we expect too much of change</strong></p>
<p>In science and technology, progress can be immensely impressive. The prototype helicopter built by Paul Cornu in 1907 was a hugely gallant contraption of plywood, string and bicycle wheels. But it is much less good at vertical take-off and hovering than the latest Sikorsky. There’s no dispute. The direction of change is clear and the sense of progress is obvious. Medicine provides endless instances of the same kind. The compelling nature of such examples can seduce us into supposing that change in general brings marvellous benefits. They encourage an excess of optimism. We extend the hopefulness which is entirely justified in specific areas like rotor blades and antibiotics and extended it to other areas where its relevance and legitimacy are, in fact, much less secure.</p>
<p>Such as politics. Think of the people who climbed onto the Berlin Wall in November 1989. The popular uprising had succeeded. It was clear that the East German state was collapsing. The mood was buoyant. Their troubles were over. Now they were free. There were huge, euphoric celebrations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6662" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>At the Brandenburg Gate, 10 November 1989</h6>
<p>It may well be argued that life is indeed better now in the East than it was in the past, under Communism. But it is far from perfect. Competition has led to unemployment. For many people, life is less secure. Today almost half the population say that the old East Germany was more good than bad.</p>
<p>The Fall of the Berlin Wall was a momentous, profound change. Yet at the time many people overestimated the benefits it would bring. It is an historic instance of a more general truth. That we tend to expect too much of change. We believe it will deliver more than it really does. Changes which look as if they must be wholly positive, turn out to have unforeseen drawbacks. This may be a natural bias of the mind. In order to summon the will to action, to rouse ourselves and our society from inertia, it may be that we have to tactically overestimate the advantages that will accrue.</p>
<p>The same ambivalence can be witnessed around the advantages of marriage, divorce, moving country, inheriting a fortune, changing one’s family lawyers, shifting the children’s schools. It’s not to say that these <em>never</em> bring the results we hope. Sometimes they do. It’s just that very often we forget that there will be new problems &#8211; as well as some real gains.</p>
<p>The new house will never be everything we can imagine the perfect house being; the new spouse will still be maddening in some ways, the new school will be wrong for the children in new ways; the new lawyers will still be pedantic about law.</p>
<p>The antidote is history. That is, the encounter with how hope played out in the past. Political history is one place we can study this. In 1997, and again in 2008, newspapers around the world were filled with excitement at the election of Tony Blair and Barack Obama. In each case, it was confidently declared, the tide of the UK or the US was turning, great things would soon be happening. Change was in the air. But a respectful and fair analysis of what happened next is sobering. The results were very mixed &#8211; as these men would be the first to admit. There were as many failures as successes. Rather than condemn them, we should draw a lesson from the experience of these leaders. Things rarely work out as well as we enthusiasts think they will.</p>
<p>We need to generalise this historical wisdom. It applies not only to Presidents and Prime Ministers but to the lesser &#8211; and to us hugely important &#8211; changes we make in the running of our own lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/670px-Obama_portrait_crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6664" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/670px-Obama_portrait_crop.jpg?resize=635%2C623" alt="670px-Obama_portrait_crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>The lesson of the Berlin Wall is not that change has no benefits. It is, rather, that if we expect too much we end up not appreciating the less dramatic, but actually real, advantages. It’s a question of sensitivity to scale. The intense celebratory atmosphere of late 1989 implied the dawn of a golden age, the radical improvement of everything. By the standard of such expectations subsequent history is a terrible let down. If you are expecting fireworks, a lone sparkler is disappointing. A more mature theory of change builds in the idea that quite a lot will &#8211; obviously &#8211; turn out badly. The benefits will be low-key, but actual. You have to adjust to a more modest scale to appreciate them.</p>
<p><strong>Two: When we underestimate the power of change</strong></p>
<p>For many generations, people in the ancient city of Pompeii lived a prosperous life. The soil was good, the climate was kindly. They built gracious houses. They planted vineyards on the slopes of nearby Mount Vesuvius</p>
<p>But all the while, the pressure of the magna inside the mountain was building up beneath the crater. No one realised; they thought all was well. They tended their orchards, gave dinner parties, struggled for status, bought works of art and, all the time, a cataclysmic change was coming. They just didn’t know how to tell. Occasionally the mountain would rumble, from time to time, a plume of smoke would rise from a cave on the upper slopes. But this had been happening as long as anyone could remember.</p>

<h6>Portrait of Paquius Proculo</h6>
<p>And then, on the 24th of August &#8211; in the year 79 AD &#8211; came the fatal moment. The volcano erupted; the city was buried under metres of ash. And all traces of their once bustling lives was lost.</p>
<p>The story of Pompeii gave rise to a view of change: Vulcanism &#8211; named after Vulcan, the god of fire and volcanoes. The story of Pompeii is so moving because we can identify with the victims. Like them, we go about our ordinary business on the natural assumption that whatever feels secure and solid today will be solid and secure tomorrow. Then a huge change comes along. And because we have not anticipated it, we are badly caught out.</p>
<p>In 2007/8 UK financial institutions that had been household names and high-street staples for decades &#8211; RBS, Lloyds TSB, Bradford and Bingley &#8211; were revealed to be deeply compromised. Only massive government intervention could keep them afloat. The major stock market index dropped dramatically.</p>

<p>When Thomas Edison showed off the first light bulb, it hardly looked like the world was about to change. It was a bizarre-looking contraption, utterly unlike anything people would want in their homes. Potential backers were deeply sceptical. But when the great banker J. P. Morgan saw it, he grasped its possibilities. It looked ridiculous, but only in superficial ways. Morgan saw past what was odd and off-putting and recognised that the lightbulb was actually a very normal idea in a strange guise. Morgan wasn’t getting carried away simply because something was new. In fact, in his eyes, the electric lightbulb was hardly novel at all. It was simply a more elegant response to a completely classic problem: how to keep on doing things when it&#8217;s dark outside.</p>
<p>It was in fact the basic similarity to gas lighting and even candles that struck Morgan. Where other people saw a strange new thing, he saw something basically very familiar. He was good at pattern recognition. He had the confidence, and wisdom, to see continuity when other people thought only in terms of disruption. He’d seen it before, with railroads and steel &#8211; he’d understood that these were simply new approaches to age-old problems. He established and held a major share in General Electric &#8211; one of the most successful corporations in the history of US business enterprise.</p>
<p>Morgan had learned to read the early signs of volcanic eruption. A wisp of smoke from a crater might have been shrugged off by many people &#8211; such things are always happening, so what, life goes on just as before, it never leads to anything. But Morgan had &#8211; as it were &#8211; studied other exploding mountains. He’d been around the railway and steel eruptions. So when the people involved in the gas lighting industry ended up buried under piles of ash, Morgan not only escaped, but was thriving.</p>
<p>When we underestimate opportunities and fail to see the potential for radical change, we deserve a good deal of sympathy. It is usually wiser to stick with what already works. The people who turned down Edison’s proposals were not stupid to do so. (Just as the many editors who rejected the manuscript of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>, by a then totally obscure Scottish woman called J.K. Rowling, were not bad editors.) Because there are few reliable signs of the momentous future of a manuscript or invention or &#8211; indeed &#8211; of a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6668" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/730px-J._K._Rowling_2010.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="730px-J._K._Rowling_2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>When people first invoked the idea of a Volcano they were in search of a metaphor of random, capricious, mysterious change on a great scale. Why should the earth suddenly explode? They really did not know.</p>
<p>But the core error is this. It is believing that what is familiar will not change. You get used to gas lamps, so you find it hard to believe that in the space of a few years, they could largely disappear. You get used to a particular kind of book doing well and find it hard to imagine something very very different being a huge hit. You get used to your orchards being on the slopes of the hill.</p>
<p>The error has long fascinated philosophers. The best statement was provided by Bertrand Russell. He imagines a turkey which is used to being fed by the farmer. It hears the tread of the farmer&#8217;s boots and feels sure that &#8211; of course &#8211; it is about to be fed, as always. Then it’s the week before Christmas …. The problem was that the Turkey wasn’t a thinker. It relied too much on habit. True, when the farmer came round it was indeed to bring food, until the last day. A philosophical Turkey would have wondered why the farmer was doing this. And speculated on the reasons, so far unknown. The presence of a major unknown factor (‘why on earth does the farmer feed me …?’) would have haunted the imagination of the Turkey.</p>
<p>The response to complacency is not so much being continually on edge as the attempt to think more deeply.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6667" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan.jpeg?resize=635%2C502" alt="John_Pierpont_J._P._Morgan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>J P Morgan was unusually adventurous and alive to the potential for change because he was good at asking the underlying, philosophical questions. He was not fixated on what they happened to be doing &#8211; lighting their streets and houses using gas. It was natural to him to wonder why people wanted gas lamps in the first place. And the answer &#8211; to get light &#8211; applied even more directly to the electric bulb than to gas. Hence his accurate prediction that change in this area would be quick and massive.</p>
<p>It’s maddening &#8211; but true &#8211; that we can underestimate the consequences of change and also overestimate them. We are prone to two kinds of error, which are opposite in character. We think change will solve everything. Then again we shrug it off and think that nothing really changes. It would be so much simpler if human nature had only one way of getting it wrong around change.</p>
<p><strong>Three: When change is frightening</strong></p>
<p>Despite the prestige of change, in reality we are often deeply disturbed by change. It’s not surprising. We learn how to cope &#8211; and thrive &#8211; in a given order of things. You know how the system works; you feel you have come to understand what works and what doesn’t. Then a big change comes along and your hard won knowledge no longer seems to work. The rules have changed. You built up good relationships with people, but they no longer run the show. Strategies that proved themselves over many years, no longer bring the results you want. There’s a new vocabulary, new buzzwords, new expectations.</p>
<p>Barney Barnato was born in London in 1852. He was a ticket tout, a music hall entertainer and a prize fighter before heading off to Africa. He dug for diamonds, struck lucky and built a business. By his mid-thirties, he was seriously rich &#8211; with a fortune of something like a billion GBP in today&#8217;s terms. He returned to London and to the consternation of existing residents built himself a huge house in Park Lane &#8211; the most fashionable address of the period.</p>
<p>Such things had not really happened much before. It had not been possible to come from a background like his and in only a decade or so emerge as rich (or richer) than most of the earls and dukes whose fortunes had been around for generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barney_Barnato00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6669" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Barney_Barnato00.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="Barney_Barnato00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The existing elite reacted in a very defensive way. They used social snobbery to pretend it wasn’t happening. Barnato was an outcast. But it was a profound error. They dismissed change as unimportant because they didn’t like its effects. Instead of learning from him they rejected the lessons of his experience. They entrenched their views and were eclipsed as the dominant class by entrepreneurs. Instead of learning from his example &#8211; and renewing their own financial fortunes &#8211; they rejected everything he stood for, because he came from the wrong background.</p>
<p>Ironically, Barnato was not a real threat at all. In fact, his descendants were deeply interested in doing exactly the same things as the traditional elite. His son, Woolf Barnato, was educated at Cambridge, hunted, and became Chairman of Bentley Motors Limited. The only difference, was that Barnato’s descendants were very much better off.</p>
<p>And today Bentley’s ultra luxurious and chic handbag is named the Barnato, after Barney’s granddaughter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Inupiat in a kayak, Noatak, Alaska, c. 1929</h6>
<p>There is a general point to be draw from that specific story. Too often our fear gets in the way. It’s been discovered that the early Norwegian settlers in Greenland suffered terrible hardships, and eventually died out, because they refused to adopt the survival skills and strategies known to the Inuit inhabitants. The Norwegians could not believe that such strange looking &#8211; and apparently unsophisticated &#8211; people could teach them anything. To their fatal cost they refused to change, because the lesson was coming in a wrapping they didn’t much like. Likewise the English elite went into serious decline in the mid-twentieth century in large part because they were so resistant to learning about major economic changes. They refused the message because it came from people like Barney Barnato.</p>
<p>So the key move is to distinguish the fear of what is unfamiliar from what is a real threat. Barnato looked a bit rough, but he was not actually hostile. The Inuit had (to the Norwegians) weird things for lunch and odd mating rituals. But these things were merely unfamiliar and not genuinely a danger.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>The Nansen–Jackson meeting at Cape Flora, 17 June 1896</h6>
<p>The fear of change is really a way of addressing one of the most basic of all human concerns: establishing a hierarchy of value. We don’t go around every day announcing that we are trying to decide which of our values are primary and which secondary. Nevertheless, this is what deep down we are doing.</p>
<p>The grand people who didn’t invite Barnato to dinner were in effect saying that background is more important than achievement. This was the moral error that lay behind their anxiety about change. The same with the Norwegian settlers in Greenland. In their hierarchy of values, it (unfortunately) mattered more where an idea came from than whether it was any good. They would have coped much more successfully with change had they had a more accurate, better thought out, set of values. The philosophical challenge around change is to reassess the rankings of what we value.</p>
<p><strong>Four: When change is slow and messy</strong></p>
<p>In 1989, there was a photo shoot of Margaret Thatcher taken in the tiny kitchen of her flat in 10 Downing Street. The Iron lady, then in her last year as Prime Minister, can be seen smartly dressed squeezed between the sink and the stove. She’s just boiled the kettle and brewed a pot of tea.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the kind of photo op we take completely for granted today. We understand that Mrs Thatcher and her advisers were carefully exploring options for brushing up her credentials as an ordinary, likeable woman in touch with day-to-day reality. She puts the kettle on and makes everyone tea.</p>
<p>And yet, in previous ages, this sort of moment would have been deeply disturbing. If William Gladstone, when he was PM in 1893 had offered to go into a kitchen, find the tea and personally boil some water for the editor of the <em>Times,</em> his sanity would have been called into question.</p>
<p>The events leading up to Margaret Thatcher’s foray by the kitchen sink didn’t start on that particular day in 1989. They actually began about sixty-five years before with the Bloomsbury Group. A few young friends, mostly living in and around Gordon Square in North London, repudiated what they saw as the fussy, pompous attitudes of their parents&#8217; generation. At the time, their habits and attitudes were laughably eccentric. But gradually they spread.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SomeBloomsburymembers-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6673" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/SomeBloomsburymembers-1.jpg?resize=635%2C382" alt="NPG Ax140432; Lady Ottoline Morrell; Maria Huxley (nÈe Nys); Lytton Strachey; Duncan Grant; Vanessa Bell (nÈe Stephen) by Unknown photographer" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>Lady Ottoline Morrell, Maria Nys, Lytton Strachey, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell</h6>
<p>World War II put an end to domestic servants for the middle class and from the late 1960s, feminism started to challenge the idea that the kitchen was the woman’s realm. These successive waves of change eventually washed us towards the moment when the most powerful man in the nation would have to prove his ease by the kitchen sink. Far from seeming odd, it feels reassuring.</p>
<p>So, a huge number of diverse concerns overlapped and reinforced one another, and gradually the assumptions about what a trustworthy leader might look like changed.</p>
<p>In contrast to the dramatic, Volcano idea of change, the prime-ministerial tea-making shows the <em>Neptunist</em> vision of change &#8211; named after Neptune, the god of the sea &#8211; in action. Year on year, the waves gradually eat into the rocks, they shift the sand. Change occurs through little, imperceptible actions, day-by-day. We can’t believe that waves could win against the huge edifice of rock and turn it into sand.</p>

<p>The causal force is weak. It’s only water lapping. But repeated often enough the effect is monumental. This is deeply counter-intuitive. We find it hard to really grasp that such events can add up to great change. We know they do in theory &#8211; but we are often caught out. In fact, if you spend only a few hours at the beach, when the tide is going out, you might imagine that the sea itself is in retreat. But this, seen properly, is only a minor episode. It’s always ebbing and flowing but overall, decade by decade, the cumulative effect is huge.</p>
<p>Of course, we understand about tides. So we don’t panic when the water recedes and get terrified at the thought that the oceans are about to dry up. But in longer and more complex cycles we do indeed get very jittery. People new to the equity market often get overexcited by a sudden rise or unduly depressed by a steep decline. Judged hour by hour, it is wildly unstable.</p>

<p>There are moments where the direction of movement is uncertain. Yet in the long-run &#8211; despite all the huge number of small variations &#8211; the overall trend is clear.</p>
<p>People tend to be adept at recognising and responding to small, short-term changes. It’s not surprising. That’s what comes naturally. We have evolved to be good at it. Yet, in order to deal well with the big challenges of life we need to be able to grasp and deal with long-term changes. And the tricky thing is that often the pattern is far from obvious close up.</p>
<p>So, in 1989 the situation was much less obvious than it is now. At that crucial moment, political aides were trying to assess where the nation was, psychologically, on the idea of a leader pouring tea in a pokey kitchen. Was this going to come across as homely, or as fake? As impressive, or as a distraction. Might not voters worry that the Prime Minister should be attending to more weighty matters?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: Permanence</strong></p>
<p>However much the external world changes, it is put in the shade by the alterations that occur at an intimate and personal level. The shift from being a child of eight to a youth of eighteen is utterly momentous. The change from being younger than most people to older than most can be profoundly unsettling. The person you got swept away by in a magical romance might turn into an annoying, cold-hearted spouse. Someone you admired from a distance, eventually becomes your friend and confidant. The child who was in awe of you and deeply impressed by everything is a few years on at loggerheads with your attitude to the politics of developing nations. The body that raced across the tennis court to return a treacherous backhand volley is (five minutes later &#8211; or so it feels) cautiously going down stairs or beset by strange pains. Personal change is along our own path to mortality.</p>
<p>It may be because we are so exposed to change in ourselves that &#8211; ultimately &#8211; we seek to make or protect things that will outlast ourselves. We have to learn to cope with change but often find ourselves deeply interested in things that resist change, that survive. The discussion of change leads to an intimate, and perhaps deeply important, question &#8211; what does one hope will not change?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don’t often think about it – and may never discuss it with others at all – but pretty much everyone has voices in their heads. Not in any sinister or disturbing way: just the murmuring stream of thoughts that runs along inside our minds most of the time. Sometimes, the voice is more explicit, encouraging you to run those final few yards: ‘you’re nearly there, keep going, keep going’. Or you might find yourself berating your ex in your head: ‘You never understood how much you hurt me, I tried to tell you, but you’d never take it in. You were always running away from the truth about yourself, weren’t you?’ And maybe the tone here is more assured and calmer than in fact you ever quite managed to be with them on that topic.</p>
<p>But sometimes, the inner voice is simply not very nice at all. It is defeatist and punitive, panic-ridden and humiliating. It doesn’t represent anything like our best insights or most mature capacities. It’s not the voice of our better nature. We find ourselves saying: ‘You disgust me, things always go to shit with you.’ This might feel natural, but another person in a similar situation might have in <em>their</em> head a very different kind of inner monologue: ‘you’ve been here before and it was OK; it’s tough and that’s fine, you’re going to pull through, just keep calm.’</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2106069013_c00dda691c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6106" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2106069013_c00dda691c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2106069013_c00dda691c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Where do inner voices come from? An inner voice always used to be an outer voice. We’ve absorbed the tone of a harassed or angry parent; the menacing threats of an elder sibling keen to put us down; the words of a schoolyard bully or a teacher who seemed impossible to please. We internalised the unhelpful voices because at certain key moments in the past they sounded compelling. The authority figures repeated their messages over and over until they got lodged in our own way of thinking.</p>
<p>To change our inner voices we need to encounter equally convincing and confident, but also helpful and constructive varieties of voices over long periods. We need to hear them often enough and around tricky enough issues that they come to feel normal and natural responses – so that, eventually, they come to feel like things we are saying to ourselves; they become our own thoughts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we are very much more likely to have the irritated voice of a teacher berating us (aged seven) for not knowing the four times table than to have the voice of Donald Winnicott playfully and lightly encouraging us to take perspective. Or it’s more likely we’ve got the words of Melissa Fry (aged 13) making us feel eternally inadequate for having the wrong haircut, skinny shoulders or the wrong kind of bike burnt into our imaginations, rather than the voice of Montaigne reminding us wryly of the universal character of folly and reminding us that (in truth) no one worth caring about judges other people in those terms.</p>
<p>Slightly brutish voices tend to be the ones that speak loudest, while the nicest, kindest, wisest and most constructive voices are comparatively quiet. So, if we want to internalise the better voices, we need to have a deliberate and active strategy for making this happen. Leaving things to chance won’t do, because the odds are we won’t meet these really benign voices at the moments when we most need them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>El Greco, <em>St. Dominic Praying</em> (1588)</h6>
<p>In the past, religions took the idea of voice-internalisation very seriously – and developed a variety of rituals and concepts to help this to occur. One of them was prayer. Certain prayers involved the frequent, regular repetition of helpful turns of phrase, like: ‘I have sinned in my thoughts and in my deed; in what I have done and in what I have failed to do&#8230;’ &#8211; which is an attempt to internalise humility.</p>
<p>Catholicism introduced the practice of the conscious ‘imitation’ of the saints, where one was invited to ask what a particular saint would have thought or said on a stressful or tempting occasion. Catholicism sets before its believers some two-and-a half thousand of the greatest, most virtuous human beings who it feels have ever lived, offering them up as potential friends whom the faithful can talk to, look at and be inspired by. These saints are each in their different ways exemplars of qualities we should hope to nurture in ourselves. Saint Joseph, for instance, may teach us how to cope calmly with the pressures of a young family and how to face the trials of the workplace with a modest and uncomplaining temper. There are moments when we may want to break down and sob in the company of Saint Jude, patron saint of lost causes, whose gentle manner can grant us comfort without any need to find immediate solutions or even hope. At times of anxiety, we could turn to Saint Philip Neri, who would never underplay our problems or humiliate us but would know how to tease out our sense of the absurd and make us laugh therapeutically at our condition. We might find it particularly consoling to guess at how the imperturbable Saint Philip would handle the hazards of a family reunion or the crash of a computer&#8217;s hard drive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Guercino, <em>Philip Neri</em> (1656)</h6>
<p>To enhance our imaginative connections with the saints, Catholicism provides us with calendars that list their birthdays, so that we may have regular occasion to withdraw from our social circle and contemplate the lives of people better than we are, for example, people who gave away all their money and wandered the earth doing good works while wearing a rough tunic to crucify the flesh (St Francis) or who used their faith in God to magically reattach a severed ear to its distressed owner&#8217;s head (St Cuthbert).</p>

<h5>An opportunity to remember positive inner voices: a sixteenth-century English psalter, tabling the birthdays of, among others, Saints Hugh, Katherine, Theodore, Edmund, Clement, Barbara, Lucy and Osmund</h5>
<p>The Christian idea of a ‘patron saint’ is really a device for getting us to internalise a voice that is useful at times of difficulty or anguish.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Andrea_Mantegna_088.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Andrea_Mantegna_088.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="Andrea_Mantegna_088" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Andrea Mantegna, <em>St. Sebastian</em> (1480)</h6>
<p>Saint Sebastian (who was shot by Roman archers on the orders of the Emperor Diocletian in 288 AD) is the archetypal voice of  courage and commitment; he’s urging us to stand firm, to stick with our convictions even though people might be saying very critical or mean things, and to believe that suffering and being treated unjustly are normal (though horrible) parts of the well-lived life. We can admire the determination of these Catholic saints to shape constructive, helpful, sane and kind inner voices – without entirely agreeing on what those voices might be saying.</p>
<p>In addition, Catholicism perceives that there is a benefit to being able to see our ideal friends around the house in miniaturised three dimensional representations. After all, most of us began our lives by having nurturing relationships with bears, bunnies and other animals, whom we would talk to and would be tacitly addressed by in turn. These animals were skilful at conveying their consoling and inspiring personalities to us. We would talk to them when we were sad and were comforted when we looked across the bedroom and saw them stoically enduring the night on our behalf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Internalising teddy’s voice: teddy is calm, cheerful, gentle… everything we want to be ourselves</h5>
<p>Catholicism sees no reason to discontinue the structure behind such relationships and so invites us to buy wood, stone, resin or plastic versions of the saints and place them on shelves or alcoves in our rooms and hallways. At times of domestic chaos, we can look across at a plastic statuette and inwardly ask what Saint Francis of Assisi would recommend that we say to our furious spouse or hysterical children now. The answer may be inside us all along, but it doesn&#8217;t usually emerge or become effective until we go through the exercise of formally asking the question of a saintly figurine.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.saintfrancisgarden.com/images/st-francis-statue.png?resize=264%2C368" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><em>                                            </em>  St Francis: What would he do next?</h5>
<p>A well-functioning secular society should take more care with its role models and &#8216;voice&#8217; internalisation processes. The harshness of our inner voices could be corrected by having access to a range of imaginary friends, whose fortifying wisdom we would regularly and ritually be able to remind ourselves of. An absence of religious belief in no way invalidates a continuing need for patron saints of qualities like Courage, Friendship, Fidelity, Patience, Confidence or Scepticism. We can still profit from moments when we give internal space to the voices of people who are more balanced, brave and generous-spirited than we are. Like children with their favourite stuffed animals, we might spend time with mature beings, through whose imaginary presence we could hope to reconnect with our calmest possibilities.</p>
<p>There are essentially six different types of stress – and six kinds of ‘inner voice’ we need to foster in order to deal with them.</p>
<p><strong>One: ANGER-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<p>One of the major kinds of stress can be termed ‘anger-stress’. This is when the feeling of not being able to cope is translated into shouting, rage and slammed doors. One seems merely angry, but beneath the theatrics, there is – importantly – a particular kind of panic at work.</p>
<p>Anger-stress arises in response to unexpected setbacks. For example, when a sudden drilling starts up in the street outside, just at the moment when one is settling down to do some concentrated work: the drill seems to be attempting to shatter one’s mind rather than the pavement. Last week it was the drains, now it’s the cable guys doing their nonsense. How can one live in a city like this?</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14638999_23c9f794cf_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6964" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14638999_23c9f794cf_z.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="14638999_23c9f794cf_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or else panic sets in when bureaucracy shows its most intransigent face: one is at the airport, there are 19 minutes until the plane is due to takes off, one can see it through the window, but the staff member insists that regulations require one to be 20 minutes ahead of the gate push-back time in order to board. One has a meeting to go to in a foreign city, 30 people are waiting, it’s crucial for business; one begs and cajoles, but to no avail. One ends up – very shamefully – calling the check-in person a ‘stupid fu***** automaton’ and banging the desk in fury like a child.</p>
<p>Or else the brilliantly slim and light laptop we’ve just bought freezes up and displays an error message just ahead of sending colleagues an important document. One curses those oily optimistic people at Apple, who seem so damn indifferent to one’s fate.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>The cause of the anger-stress is a seeming deep injustice which appears not to be recognised by the world. A particular craziness, unreliability, meanness, obtuseness appears not to have received enough attention – and therefore one erupts into anger in a vain attempt to correct or protest at the indifference of others. The outburst draws energy from a desire to externalise the pain the world has inflicted and to strike back with equal force (even if only by flinging a cushion against the wall). Our anger is a (doomed) attempt to communicate the degree to which our sense of justice has been violated. We want everyone to know that the behaviour of the airline is outrageous, that the roadworks are profoundly wrong and that it is absurd that the richest corporation in the world should make laptops that routinely crash. We make a lot of noise because no one else seems to realise how terrible it all is.</p>

<p>Our rage comes down to a betrayed optimism: a dramatic gap has opened up between how we expected things were going to go and how they have actually turned out. We had believed that the morning at home would be tranquil; we had believed boarding the flight would be easy, we had assumed the computer was reliable&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>The priority is to redraw one’s underlying image of what is normal in a more gently pessimistic direction. One is suffering not merely because things have gone wrong, but because they have gone wrong against a backdrop where one expected them to go right; and it is this second, aggravating factor that is both vicious in its effects and yet eminently amenable to treatment.</p>
<p>Stress-anger is laced with strong doses of paranoia. It seems one has been singled out for suffering. So one has to open the lens and see that one’s mishaps, though maddening, are neither unique nor representative of anything in one’s character. No one is specifically out to get us. Many millions have suffered computer malfunctions. Airline staff are known the world over for their intransigent manner. The laying down of fiber optic cables has turned all streets into drilling zones. We need to get more acquainted with the ample role of frustration in every ordinary and good life.</p>

<p>It’s important that such bad news be broken to us in a particular way; a voice which seems gentle, kind and unhurried. It should feel as if a sympathetic arm was being put around our shoulder by someone who has lived long and seen a great many sad things, which hasn’t embittered them however, but has afforded them a melancholy wry look on the trials of existence. They tell us that ‘of course’ life is frustrating and that in many ways, it would have been better never to have been born. They know how it feels, they have been there too (our rages which we’re now embarrassed about are things that every decent human being sometimes goes through; it’s nothing to be proud of, but nor is it a reason to hate oneself indefinitely. We&#8217;ve all had our hysterical moments).</p>
<p>It is helpful not just to know these arguments in theory, but also to have an example of someone who put them into practice in their own life. We need a patron saint of experienced, wry pessimism; a patron saint to help quell the rash optimism that lies beneath our most vicious outbursts.</p>

<p>Born in Danzig in 1788, Arthur Schopenhauer is one of the world&#8217;s finest philosophers and most adorable grumps: “There is only one inborn error,&#8217; he tells us, &#8216;and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy… So long as we persist in this inborn error… the world will seem to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of maintaining a happy existence… hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear the expression of what is called disappointment.”</p>
<p>Schopenhauer is always speaking in the voice of mature pessimism: of course, things work out pretty badly, he tells us, with a glint of humour in his eyes. They usually do. What else can one expect? The world is populated by bastards, fools and selfish egoists. I get it. They’ve let you down. ‘I know’, he tells us down the ages. The same kind of thing happened to me just about every single day of my life&#8230;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schopenhauer tells us without bitterness that life is quite sad. He’s free of bitterness because he is not expecting it to be wonderful; he’s not surprised or amazed or even particularly disappointed when marriage, career, travel, social life – and the mending of the roads – turn out to be a bit awful.</p>
<p>If we can internalise his words and the attitude they express and draw upon them we we need them, then our rage and bitterness are lessened, we are still faced with problems – of course – we still have to book the flight, get on with working or sort out the power supply, but with a slightly less panicked and persecuted air.</p>
<p>Feast on the consoling, stress-reducing pessimism of this noble patron saint:</p>
<p>&#8220;We can regard our life as a uselessly disturbing episode in the blissful repose of nothingness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Human existence must be a kind of error… it may be said of it, &#8216;It is bad today and every day it will get worse, until the worst of all happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is like a soap-bubble which we maintain and inflate for as long as possible, yet with the absolute certainty that it will burst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is a sorry business, I have resolved to spend it reflecting upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes I speak to men and women just as a little girl speaks to her doll. She knows, of course, that the doll does not understand her, but she creates for herself the joy of communication through a pleasant and conscious self-deception.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We should always be mindful of the fact that no man is ever very far from the state in which he would readily want to seize a sword or poison in order to bring his existence to an end; and those who are far from believing this could easily be convinced of the opposite by an accident, an illness, a violent change of fortune – or of the weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After his fortieth year… any man of merit&#8230; will hardly be free from a certain touch of misanthropy”</p>
<p>And finally, a sentence that should be written above all airport entrances and on the back of computers: “Human existence must be a kind of error.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Two: HUMILIATION-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>Stress is always closely tied to a fear of failing at something. Humiliation-stress is a particular subcategory where what one most fears about failing are &#8211; in essence &#8211; the imagined mean reactions of others. One is stressed about being laughed at and denigrated, about having one&#8217;s faults cruelly discussed, about being the butt of jokes; one is going to fail and lose one’s dignity and good standing.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209413578_77a5a61623_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6120" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209413578_77a5a61623_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="3209413578_77a5a61623_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>This is the stress that kicks in minutes before one is due to go on stage to give a presentation; or when one is going to finally launch an online business that one left a secure job in order to start; or when one is publishing a book, standing for office or will be ranked in the office sales force hierarchy.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>In states of humiliation-stress, the mocking and contemptuous voice has come right inside one’s head. It’s no-longer simply stating the mean thoughts of other people, it’s become the voice of one’s own fears – whatever the outside world is actually saying. One is always ready with a highly dispiriting narrative about who one is. At times, one can just about tolerate oneself. With lots of success, one can stay one step ahead of the inner denigrator, but every time a challenge looms, the critical voice comes back: ‘I am indeed, as the critics say, an idiot, a failure and a fool’.</p>
<p>Humiliation-stress is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because we’re so nervous around possible humiliation – because this fear is so active and powerful – we get flustered and make extra mistakes, we lose focus, we stumble and get confused. And then of course we do become the targets for the harsh, humiliating judgements of others.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209421302_5bc8c81501_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6121" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3209421302_5bc8c81501_z.jpg?resize=635%2C402" alt="3209421302_5bc8c81501_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The root cause of humiliation-stress is the belief that love, respect and kindness only ever come via worldly success or competence. Deep down we have become convinced that certain kinds of imperfect action (not being able to make a public speech, taking time to learn to drive a car, not being especially brilliant at sales, writing a mediocre book) rightly debar anyone from the warm embrace of love and appreciation. Only those who succeed can be loved.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We urgently need to incorporate a voice that separates out achievement from love: that reminds us that we may be worthy of affection even if we fail and that being winner is only one part, and not necessarily the most important part, of one’s identity.</p>
<p>This is – traditionally – the voice of the mother, but perhaps also of the nine-year-old child chatting to his or her mum or dad about a stress at the office. It is the voice of a person who loves you for being you, outside of achievement.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, knowing one is loved whatever happens to one in the world sets up ideal preconditions for doing well. It gives one the energy to take risks and feel resilient – without letting acute anxiety get in the way of performance.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: GUANYIN</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13801979266.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6122" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13801979266.jpg?resize=635%2C617" alt="13801979266" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>Guanyin, 12th Century</h6>
<p>In Buddhism, Guanyin is a reassuring female deity one goes to visit in temples and chats to about one&#8217;s largest woes. Like the Virgin Mary, she hears us in our distress, meets us with tenderness and strengthens us to face the tasks of life. She is the person one thinks of when one can’t cope, when one just wants to weep, pull the duvet over one’s head and craves to be forgiven by someone deeply kind and gentle. We should be mature enough to allow ourselves moments when we regress to be in the company of such a voice.</p>
<p>The centrality of maternal figures in both Buddhism and Christianity suggests that adult lives share moments of deep self-doubt – and longings to recover some of the security of childhood. We need to be reassured that these wishes are not a sign that we have failed as human beings.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2236162299_acdef877fa_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6969" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2236162299_acdef877fa_z.jpg?resize=635%2C594" alt="2236162299_acdef877fa_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guanyin’s role is to hear us in our distress, to listen with mercy and tenderness to our fears. She gives voice to the thought that adult life inevitably will involve moments of deep self-doubt, and feelings that one cannot cope alone. Such vulnerability is not to be read as a sign we have failed as a human. Guanyin&#8217;s implicit thesis is that being loved and worldly success are two separate things. You deserve compassion not because of the excellence of what you do, but because you exist. Achievement is not the currency of kindness.</p>
<p>We need to make this voice our own and to summon it inside our own heads when faced with humiliation-stress. It doesn’t make the task go away. One will still have to make the speech, get better at selling (or find another job); but these real tasks can now be faced with a little more poise. Because a little less is on the line. The root of the extreme stress was not purely the fear that one might fail. Rather it was the incendiary thought that failure would mean you deserved to be ridiculed and abandoned. When the threat of that emotional catastrophe is lifted, one is better placed to get on and cope with the practical tasks to hand.</p>
<p><strong>Three: PANIC-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>You’re up against a huge challenge: you’ve recently taken up rock-climbing as a sport. You’re in Scotland, several hundred meters above the ground, on a cliff face. Suddenly, you panic. You can’t do this. You’re meant to keep climbing another thirty meters, veering to the left, making use of the drier limestone, before you reach flat ground and can make it gently down to Fort William. The problem is, you’re unable to make even a single move. Fear has frozen you. You’re going to drop down and meet your end at the base of the cliff. You have had a look below and the trees seem like matchsticks. You have a wife (who told you this wasn’t a good idea) and three children at home.</p>

<p>Or, to take another example, you’re supposed to get a report done before Tuesday, but there are three big sections that you’re not quite on top of yet. You are also supposed to give a briefing on Monday about the Swedish strategy and there’s a problem emerging with the new key legal person you hired last month. You feel that the problems are too hard and multiple and that you will soon be found out by the management. You put your head in your hands and are deeply tempted to walk across to the corner office and hand in your resignation.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES:</strong></p>
<p>In deciding whether or not panic is appropriate, we don’t calmly scan the horizon, measure our strengths, take a cool assessment of our own capacities and mobilise our forces in strict response to the demands of the situation. We respond by instinct – and these instincts are often nothing more than the incorporated voices of some distinctly panicky others from way back.</p>
<p>Many of us grew up around nervous people: people who lost their tempers the moment the parking ticket couldn’t be found, who were knocked off course by relatively minor administrative hurdles (the electricity bill), who felt daunted by the prospect of going on holiday (there were always screams on the way to the airport) and who grew jumpy every time they momentarily mislaid the house keys&#8230; These people had no faith in themselves and therefore – without necessarily wanting to do us harm – couldn’t have much faith in our own abilities. Every time we faced an exam, they got more alarmed than we did. They always asked multiple times if we had enough to wear when we went outside. They worried about our friends and our teachers. They were sure the gap year was going to turn into a disaster.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1466951877_bd59b406c6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6127" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/1466951877_bd59b406c6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="1466951877_bd59b406c6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now these voices have become our own and cloud our capacity to take an accurate measure of what we are capable of. We have internalised voices of irrational fear and fragility.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>It’s a symptom of panic that our alarmed response feels – at the time – deeply plausible. It doesn’t reveal that it is an exaggerated response that is blinding us to an accurate assessment of our possibilities.</p>
<p>At such moments, we need an outside voice that can pause our runaway fears and remind us of the strengths we have latent within us, which the currents of panic have hidden from us.</p>
<p>Fear is catching, but – just as importantly – so can confidence be. If another person whom one respects tell us with calm authority that (from where they are standing) they sincerely think we can do it, we may just be able to find the wherewithal to side with their verdict. We respond well to having a good image of ourselves to try to live up to – as every good leader knows.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: GENERAL EISENHOWER</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower_d-day.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6125" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Eisenhower_d-day.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="Eisenhower_d-day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6>General Dwight D. Eisenhower addresses American paratroopers prior to D-Day</h6>
<p>General Eisenhower led American troops through some of the most fearful events of World War II. He was legendary for spending a lot of time with his soldiers on the front, and in particular, with managing to transmit a high degree of confidence to them.</p>
<p>When he told his troops (as he often did) ‘I know you can do it,’ this wasn’t a vapid bromide thrown out to encourage hapless cannon fodder before he bolted back to the comforts of his command centre. It reflected a real faith that his young American charges truly had a very good chance of pushing back the German forces that controlled northern France. Though the Germans had been victorious in the West since 1939, Eisenhower understood that in the long-term, the advantage would necessarily go to the Allies: they had the largest number of troops, superior technology and men motivated by a love of freedom rather than fear of dictatorship. His confidence wasn’t bluster, it was based on seeing virtues in his men that fear had blinded them to. His words bridged the gap between what they were capable of, and what – on the night before parachuting into Normandy – they could remember of themselves through the fog of their anxiety.</p>
<p>We should – when facing our own more modest challenges – have a version of Eisenhower in our own minds, ready to remind us that (tomorrow morning) we will surely have the strength to do what the task demands of us.</p>
<p><strong>FOUR: SHAME-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong></p>
<p>This is the stress one feels in the wake of having done some shameful things: stayed in bed all day when we should have been at work; downloaded pornography on the family computer; shouted at a guy at the office; procrastinated for three weeks with a report; flirted with the person in charge of North American sales&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14496537236_932d9a9acd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6971" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14496537236_932d9a9acd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="14496537236_932d9a9acd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>© Flickr/Holly Lay</h6>
<p>It’s evident that normal, kind, sensible, mature people aren’t meant to do these things. There’s something wrong with us. We are one of the sick, warped ones. We are worried, fearful for the future, but more than that, ashamed of who we are.</p>
<p>This isn’t just unpleasant. This limits one’s ability to move on. The existence of the bad thing becomes a reason never to develop. ‘If you’re here, you’ve got to stay here’, says the inner voice. Or, even more brutally, ‘You’re doomed not to be a freak.’</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>The panic is rooted in an inability to get a clear picture of what is actually normal. The panicked person suffering from shame-stress can’t believe that quite good people have been through similar rather contemptible moments.</p>
<p>People who otherwise displayed loyalty, dedication, seriousness, grandeur also went through stages where they were extraordinarily lazy, or mean or did some strange things around sex.</p>
<p>These lapses may not be anything to be proud of, but they have a role in the narrative of an ordinary well-lived life. People whom one admires have been here too.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We need to broaden our sense of how much contemptible stuff can go on in an otherwise good life.</p>
<p>We don’t need a voice that condones our bad sides: we need one that can calmly recognise them and accept them as the price people sometimes have to pay in order to move on to a further stage of growth.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: MADAME DEVAUCAY</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image24.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6129" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/image24.png?resize=507%2C661" alt="image24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In 1807, Ingres painted the portrait of Madame Antonia Devaucay de Nittis, a beautiful young woman living in Rome, who had been the mistress of many men at the top of Napoleonic French society and was at that moment the girlfriend of the French Ambassador to the Holy See, Charles Jean Marie Alquier. Antonia and Charles were having to navigate some choppy diplomatic waters: Napoleon had forcibly summoned Pope Pius VII to Paris in 1804 to attend his coronation as Emperor. The Pope resented but couldn’t ignore French power. Madame Devaucay needed to be political and persuasive without in any way seeming to be.</p>
<p>In Ingres’s remarkable picture, we contemplate not merely the appearance of a particular woman, as she was in Rome in 1807. We see the sort of person who might be able to rehabilitate us in our own eyes after a shameful episode. She is a corrective to shame-stress.</p>
<p>Something about Madame Devaucay’s mouth and smile speaks of worldly tolerance. It is easy to believe that we could tell this mouth almost anything (how we hadn’t paid our taxes or had done something bad in the French Revolution or had unusual sexual tastes), and its owner wouldn’t hold us primly to account, wouldn’t react with shock or moralising or provincial censorship; she would know her fair share about how troubled our souls can get without losing their claim to a fundamental decency.</p>
<p>Irritation with oneself can mount to unbearable levels because it feels so unusual to be foolish, sexual, furious, lazy&#8230; The inner voice says: you are the worst person, unique in your capacity for stupid behaviour (losing your temper, making a clumsy attempt to kiss X, wasting money, telling a lie to save your skin). By contrast Madame Devaucay is the voice of complex understanding.</p>
<p>She was very good at consoling people (Ingres included). She wasn’t frightened or shocked by admissions of frailty or failure. We can imagine her down the centuries saying: ‘I know you feel an idiot, but everyone is a bit like that sometimes; I understand. Actually, tomorrow it will seem quite funny and we’ll joke about it together. I’ve seen so much worse, from people you wouldn’t believe, even respectable and dignified ones whom we all admire&#8230;’</p>
<p><strong>FIVE: EXAGGERATION-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>This is the sort of stress where, to an outsider, it is at once apparent that perspective has been lost:</p>
<p>– someone has missed the train, now they’re saying they want to kill themselves.<br />
– someone has had an argument with their partner over the washing up, now they want to break up.<br />
– someone didn’t come first in the exam; now they feel their entire career is over.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>In the visual arts, having perspective means a capacity to see different things in their true spatial relations: what is far away looks distant and smaller, what is near looks closer and larger. It was surprisingly difficult for artists to learn how to achieve perspective on a canvas – which suggests that the manoeuvre may be equally challenging in other areas of our lives.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6130" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="56a77f3cd1f8cd918df57ce512da296c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6>Before the discovery of perspective: a swan is bigger than a tree and people would never fit through the doors of the houses</h6>
<p>In our lives, having perspective involves an ability to compare an apparently traumatic event in the present with the experiences of humanity across the whole of its history – in order to work out what level of attention and fear it should fairly demand. How stressed should we be – really – about the argument, the delayed plane, the less than stellar result?</p>
<p>With perspective in mind, we soon realise that – contrary to what our inner voices suggest – hardly anything is totally unprecedented, few things are truly amazing and very little is absolutely terrible. The sacking will not mean the end of us; it will just change a lot of things in many different small and complicated ways. The economic indices are grim, but we have weathered comparable drops many times and even the worst scenarios only predict that we will return to a standard of living we had a few years ago, when life was still possible. A bad flu may disrupt international travel and defeat known drugs for a while, but research laboratories will eventually understand and contain it. The floods look dramatic, but in the end, they will affect merely a fraction of the population and recede soon enough. Cancers and heart-attacks have multiple causes that we may never understand completely, but eternal life was never on the agenda. Rome fell, but six hundred years later, everything was almost back to normal again.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>We need our dramas to be returned to size. We need to be made to feel small.</p>
<p>To be made to ‘feel small’ is, to be sure, a painful daily reality of the human playground. But to be made to feel small by something mighty, noble, accomplished and intelligent is to have wisdom presented to us along with a measure of kindness and persuasiveness. There are sights in the natural world (icebergs, mountains, stars) that can induce us to surrender our egoism without in any way humiliating us. We can set aside our ordinary concerns and take on board (in a way we never dare to do when we are under direct fire from other humans) the miniscule size of our dramas. We can survey ourselves as if from a distance, no longer offended by the wounds inflicted on our self-esteem, feeling newly indifferent to our eventual fate, generous towards the universe and open-minded about its course.</p>
<p>In moments of frustration and disaster, the philosopher Spinoza recommended that we consider what befalls us from a cosmic perspective or in his famous and lyrical coinage, &#8216;under the aspect of eternity&#8217;, <em>sub specie aeternitatis</em>. Fascinated by the new generation of telescopes and the knowledge of other planets that they yielded, Spinoza proposed that we imaginatively step out of ourselves and practice submitting our will to the laws of the universe, however contrary these might be to our intentions.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spinoza1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Spinoza1.jpg?resize=635%2C556" alt="Spinoza" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We should comfort ourselves for our humiliations not by trying to puff ourselves up, but by taking steps to further appreciate our nothingness. The modern world lacks rituals to put us gently in our place. It surreptitiously incites us to consider the present moment as the summit of history and the achievements of our fellow humans as the measure of all things – a grandiosity destined to plunge the majority of us into continuous swirls of anxiety and envy.</p>
<p>Religion used to restore perspective: at morning prayer and the weekly service, at the harvest celebration and the baptism, greater or lesser moments when we imaginatively step out of the earthly city and recalibrate our lives according to a larger, more cosmic set of measurements.</p>
<p>If there is any point of access to this process of re-evaluation open to both atheists and believers, it is via an element in nature that looms large in Spinoza&#8217;s <em>Ethics</em>; it is through the contemplation of the stars that we are afforded the best chance of accessing redeeming feelings of awe.</p>

<p>Sadly, the scientific authorities officially in charge of interpreting the stars for us rarely realise the therapeutic import of the material they oversee. In austere scientific language, space agencies inform us of the properties and trajectories of heavenly bodies, yet they seldom consider astronomy as either a source of wisdom or a plausible answer to suffering.</p>
<p>However, science should matter to us not only because it helps us to control parts of the world, but also because it shows us what we will never master. We would do well to dwell daily, as the religious do on their God, on the nine and half trillion kilometres in a single light-year or on the luminosity of the largest known star in our galaxy, Eta Carinae, 7,500 light years away, 400 times the size of the sun and 4 million times as bright. We should punctuate our calendars with celebrations in honour of VY Canis Majoris, a red hypergiant in the constellation Canis Major, 5,000 light-years from earth and 2,100 times the size of the Sun. Nightly, after the main news bulletin and before the celebrity quiz, there should be a moment of solemnity as we dwell upon the 200 to 400 billion stars in our galaxy, the 100 billion galaxies and the 3 septillion stars in the universe. Whatever their value to science, the stars are in the end just as valuable to mankind as solutions to our megalomania and anxiety.</p>
<p>In recognition of our need to be repeatedly connected through our senses to ideas of transcendence, we should ensure that a percentage of all prominently positioned television screens be connected to live feeds from the transponders of our extraplanetary telescopes.</p>
<p>We would then be able to ensure that our frustrations, broken hearts, hatreds of those who haven&#8217;t called us and regrets for opportunities that have passed us by are continuously rubbed up against, and salved by, the thought of galaxies like Messier 101, a spiral structure 23 million light years away, sitting in the bottom left of the constellation Ursa Major, majestically unaware of everything that we are and consolingly unsaddened by all that tears us apart.</p>

<p><strong>SIX: HUMOURLESS-STRESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>
<p>A lot of stress has the incidental quality of being extremely earnest. With immense solemnity, we worry to an extraordinary extent about the results for Q3. Profits are marginally down in the Asia-Pacific region, and it seems as if someone had died. An interviewee is five minutes late, and everyone in the room is starting to twitch, look at their phones and remember all the other, far better things they could be doing.</p>
<p><strong>CAUSES</strong></p>
<p>As in exaggeration-stress, perspective has been lost, an ostensibly small things have started to loom very large.</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>When dealing with exaggeration-stress, the strategy is to <strong><em>minimise</em> </strong>the stressful situation in order to usher in calm.</p>
<p>But when dealing with humourless-stress, we need to take a different line: we need to <strong><em>exaggerate</em></strong> the stressful situation to such an extent that it becomes a source of comedy and therefore of a certain kind of calm too.</p>
<p>The strategy is to maximise the exaggeration to the point where even the worrier can see that their stress has grown far larger than its cause.</p>
<p><strong>PATRON SAINT: MICKEY SACKS (WOODY ALLEN)</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In <em>Hannah and her Sisters </em>(1986)<em>,</em> Woody Allen plays Mickey Sacks, who is like you and me, except a little more so. Everything we might worry about, he is onto already and he worries so much, with such theatricality and whining New York intonations, it has the peculiar effect of calming us down and making us laugh at our own exaggerations.</p>
<p>What we worry about every now and then, Mickey worries about at every moment. He worries about sex, the meaning of life, his relationships – and most of all, he worries about dying.</p>
<p>He is constantly detecting symptoms of his mortal diseases. Recently, he’s started to hear a slight buzzing sound in one ear. It can mean only one thing… He is dying of a brain tumour. This is how he interacts with his colleague Gail, as recorded in Woody Allen&#8217;s script for the film:</p>
<p><em>The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen. She takes off her glasses and squints.</em></p>
<p>GAIL<br />
Mickey, what&#8217;s the matter with you? You&#8217;re all white!</p>
<p><em>The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands. He walks over to Gail. The phone continues to ring.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
I feel dizzy. Sshh, you know, I don&#8217;t feel well.</p>
<p><em>He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
Do you hear a ringing? Is there, is there a, is there a ringing sound?</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
(gesturing)<br />
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I hear, I hear it.</p>
<p><em>She sits down and picks up the phone.</em></p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
(shaking his head)<br />
N-n-no, not that.</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
<em>(overlapping, into the telephone)</em><br />
Hello?</p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
<em> (turning to Gail, gesturing nervously)</em><br />
Sssss, if I have a brain tumour, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m gonna do.</p>
<p>GAIL<br />
You don&#8217;t have a brain tumour. The doctor didn&#8217;t say you had a brain tumour.</p>
<p>MICKEY<br />
No, naturally. They&#8217;re not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th&#8211;, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell &#8216;em. Oh, God!<br />
<em>(looking around worriedly and touching Gail&#8217;s shoulder: the phone is ringing again)</em><br />
Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?</p>
<p>Mickey is the voice of comic exaggeration. He helps us feel less stressed – and cope better with our worries because he makes them look so large, even we’re forced to concede that perspective has been lost. Most of the time, we tend not even to notice that we are exaggerating. That&#8217;s why we need comic voices. From the inside it feels simply so serious what time the taxi is going to come, or who said what to the boss or what the doctor will say. Mickey shows us how to deflate our exaggerations by pushing them further and further until their absurdity become obvious, and we willingly take the air out of them.</p>
<p>For this to work, the comedy has to be generous. If we simply mock Mickey (ourselves), we don’t gain any therapeutic benefit. Ideally satire and parody don’t leave us humiliated, because that’s no help in trying to cope better with anxiety. Rather, they teach us to be witty about our troubles and sorrows.</p>
<p>It’s a slightly weird truth that a lot of anxiety (and conflict) grows because we haven’t got a good way of backing out. We sort of know we are being silly in our massive worries and especially in our arguments with those close to us. It’s just that we don’t know how to climb down without being humiliated and perhaps conceding too much to the other person’s equally exaggerated contrary views.</p>
<p>Funniness, self-parody, irony, wry wit and humour all allow an attractive method of backing down while preserving one’s self-respect.</p>

<p>In different ways, these six voices are correctives to our most vicious and unhelpful inner narratives. We should take care to rehearse them at moments when we can lay claim to a measure of sanity and calm &#8211; so they&#8217;ll be with us the next time the drilling starts or the plane is delayed.</p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">What it says on the tin: theoretical physics is really hard</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Einstein’s blackboard makes it totally plain why one won’t be able to make fundamental advances in science without thinking very deeply. The process is incredibly complicated<strong><em> and looks very complicated too</em></strong> – which is a bonus. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, many other impressive results don’t come with a public reminder of the thinking that went into them. They look simple, natural and easy.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6975" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o.jpg?resize=635%2C428" alt="13980689711_4dc7546ac9_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<h6>© D68 Design+art</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It looks as if anyone could have designed this in about two minutes</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the principles advocated by Dieter Rams, Chief Design Officer at Braun from 1961 to 1995 – is that good design makes products unobtrusive and intuitively understandable. In other words, it has a paradoxical effect: the better the design, the less you notice the labour that has gone into it. The design team might be slogging away for years, discarding imperfect versions and bashing their brains to simplify the product. But when they succeed, they make us – the consumers – feel as if none of that ever happened. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some problems hide how tricky they are. So we forget how long it takes to get them right. We forget how much difficulty they exact &#8211; and tend to rush and get impatient when we stumble over them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to think hard not only about physics, but also about the big everyday challenges that trip us up: how to form stable relationships, how to master emotions, how to bring up children, how to find careers that can satisfy our talents, how to deal with the defensive member of our team&#8230; Each of these is a devilishly complicated matter, almost as hard as Einstein’s conundrums, but sadly for us, the difficulties get concealed.</span></p>
<p class="p1">We should ensure we have an accurate map of difficulty and won&#8217;t be undermined by the idea that certain troubles are unworthy of minute attention.</p>

<h6 class="p1">Engines Audi 3.2 V6 FSI</h6>
<p class="p1">This is one of the most efficient petrol engines ever constructed. The V6-FSI by Audi has gone into the new A5 generation of cars: it produces 199kW at 6500 rpm and torque of 330 Nm occurs around 4000rpm. Part of the reason that it is so efficient – and part of what makes us human beings comparatively inefficient – is that the V6-FSI has only <em><strong>one</strong></em> goal. And that goal is exceptionally clear: it has to propel a car along tarmac roads.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a general principle: no entity can be optimally efficient at <strong><em>more than one thing</em></strong>. A robot that has to both climb stairs and make pancakes will be far less efficient than two distinct machines each of which can focus exclusively on one task. The more limited the goals, the higher one’s chance of efficiency. A multipurpose machine – human or corporate – is always going to be less efficient than one which is dedicated to a single purpose.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4018079840_74d09959c5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6980" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/4018079840_74d09959c5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4018079840_74d09959c5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/biologycorner</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"> Knowing what we want this to do is half the battle</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unlike the V6 engine from Audi, our brains are not specifically designed or evolved to be maximally efficient at one thing. Instead, this cognitive and emotional machine is profoundly generalist – it comes moderately well equipped for a huge range of possible activities: to write a novel, spear a fish, bring up a child, drive very fast up Fifth Avenue, sit in the office all day, live in New Guinea, marry, plot an assassination, live in an ice cave, go into politics, stay single, or expand a small business into the Asia market. </span></p>
<p class="p1">Although focus is something we value, it isn’t &#8211; and can’t be &#8211; the only thing we care about. It has to be put into the mix with other concerns. We might well accept a measure of inefficiency – in professional and personal life – in exchange for diversity and less boredom.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Focusing on one thing to the exclusion of all others has its costs, as anyone who has ever spoken to an athlete about extra-curricular issues tends to find out.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no such thing as work-life balance. Everything worth fighting for unbalances your life</span></h5>
<p class="p1">In short, we have to choose &#8211; but we rarely know if we have chosen wisely. This is the dilemma at the heart of Existentialism – a philosophy developed in Denmark in the 19th century, which drew compassionate and intelligent attention to the difficulties created for humans by having insufficient knowledge and time to make optimal choices.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kierkegaard.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6067" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/kierkegaard.jpg?resize=635%2C445" alt="kierkegaard" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Søren Kierkegaard (1838)</h6>
<p class="p1">The great Existentialist Soren Kierkegaard wrestled all his life with the issue of who he should marry. For a time, he thought he’d found the answer: a young attractive woman called Regine Olsen. Regine rejected him for a while, then finally she accepted him, at which point he began to have doubts. The whole saga took up a good 10 years of his life and caused enormous damage on all sides.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The frustration led Kierkegaard to one of the most beautifully intemperate passages in his masterpiece <em>Either/Or</em>:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Marry, and you will regret it; don’t marry, you will also regret it; marry or don’t marry, you will regret it either way. Laugh at the world’s foolishness, you will regret it; weep over it, you will regret that too; laugh at the world’s foolishness or weep over it, you will regret both. Believe a woman, you will regret it; believe her not, you will also regret it&#8230; Hang yourself, you will regret it; do not hang yourself, and you will regret that too; hang yourself or don’t hang yourself, you’ll regret it either way; whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy.”</span></p>
<p class="p1">The Existentialists offer us a useful corrective to the normal, pernicious view that choice might be easy. A Kierkegaardian approach should never be a first move, but once we&#8217;ve done our best to pick wisely, the philosophy usefully tempers the modern sentimental notion that we could potentially have it all and that perfect choice is within reach. That  you suffer from the agony of choice isn’t an anomaly. It’s one of the most interesting and predictable things about being alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><strong>I. Office Victorians</strong></p>
<p class="p1">In the 19th century, British explorers were famous for not getting stressed. They might &#8211; like David Livingstone in his travels in central Africa between 1851 and 1883 &#8211; get attacked by a lion, suffer pneumonia, see most of their companions die of malaria and dysentery &#8211; and yet remain calmly optimistic. Livingstone’s journal (written in berry juice when the ink ran out) isn’t a record of his gripes or personal anxieties. It’s filled with tranquil speculations about central African water-systems and careful observations about goat trading.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Rencontre_de_Livingstone_-_How_I_found_Livingstone_(fr).png?resize=688%2C427" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>After going missing for several years, when Livingstone finally met up with his fellow explorer Henry Morton Stanley, there was no great show of emotion. For Victorian missionaries and explorers, stress was not an acceptable state of mind. One had to be positive and in control at all times.</p>
<p class="p1">This attitude didn’t disappear at the end of the 19th century. Of course, it is now quite unacceptable within relationships, but it flourishes in another major area of life: work. Modern business is full of people who deny their inner suffering &#8211; and who are, despite lots of surface differences and outward markers of casualness and openness, in their own way just as buttoned up as legendary Victorian explorers enduring the tropics in crisply-ironed khaki.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/457193030.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6983" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/457193030.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="Simon Cowell : Photocall - MIPCOM 2014 In Cannes" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Whatever the rhetoric, being tough is currently crucial at the office. There’s a prevalent and distinctly brutish idea at large that one should be hard to impress, harsh in identifying people’s defects and unmoved by failure in others and oneself: empathy for the weak is itself a fatal weakness.</p>
<p class="p1">Because self-doubt is taboo, it can be hard to recognise that it even exists. The world’s offices are full of people (let’s call them Office Victorians) who come across as unyielding and coldly confident, when the strange, underlying fact is that they are terrified &#8211; and yet they see business as too dangerous a place in which to own up to being afraid and in doubt. It takes a courage and a trust in one’s own authority which is easy to lack in order to admit that things may be spinning out of control. Far easier to settle into a composure of grim stolidity.</p>
<p class="p1">For those of us who have to work around Office Victorians, it is useful to know that outwardly very intimidating people might be scared, rather than mean. If we have to deal with their rigid certainties and barked orders, we shouldn’t respond to the iciness, but need to go beneath the surface behaviour in order to try to deal with the frightened child within. It will be tricky, though, because they’ll make that interpretation feel entirely inappropriate. That’s part of their self-defence.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">Office Victorians give the impression that stress is something one should be ashamed of when in fact, real bravery involves a capacity to admit to worry and fragility.</p>
<p class="p1">Once one looks at the office as a place full of the walking wounded, there&#8217;s no shortage of evidence for how hard it is to cope. Someone who has been doing well in the company for a few years starts, perhaps quite suddenly, to be beset by large worries about the purpose of work, the direction of their career and the state of their relationships. They get very interested in travelling; they’re always checking up prices of flights to Istanbul or Airbnb options in Sao Paulo. They make some weird remarks: ‘We’re all going to die, so why are we worrying about the China market?’ They mention ‘the death of God’ at a meeting of regional sales reps. During a break in a planning session, while pouring a cup of coffee, they ask a colleague ‘Are you ever struck by the thought that it might have been better never to have been born?’ or ‘What do you think it would be like to be a cloud?’ On two Monday mornings in a row they come in looking haggard. Emerging from the lift, it looks as if they have been crying on the way up to the 15th floor. They look out of the window a lot. They are going through what might be called an ‘existential’ crisis – named in acknowledgment of the mid-twentieth Century French philosophers, the Existentialists, like Camus and Sartre, who were especially interested in the panicked feeling that one’s current life is meaningless.</p>

<h6 class="p1">Albert Camus, 1957</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The first instinct would be to say that these are all signs of a bad employee. Their work is definitely suffering; other people are getting bothered. The company might start to think about how much it’s going to cost to let them go. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But management shouldn’t be scared. An existential crisis doesn&#8217;t mean someone is a bad employee (though something does need to be done). We need to give ourselves much less alarming accounts of what’s going on when an individual falls into a state where they are puzzled, angry, worried or unduly thoughtful about the purpose and direction of their life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Going through such mental anguish from time to time, at least every few years, is a natural, even inevitable part of being human. You don’t get confused and troubled because you are misguided, weak-willed or selfish, but because you are complex, thoughtful, fragile and – like everyone – slightly broken.</span></p>
<p class="p1">At a collective level, we’ve given ourselves unfrightened accounts of what’s going on when teenagers sit moodily staring out of the window and can&#8217;t answer when someone asks them what is going on or requests them to pass the salt. We know these young people aren&#8217;t heading directly for a life of delinquency; we can stay confident that a reconciliation with the demands of the world will emerge.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/533076346_ef3273c830_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6986" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/533076346_ef3273c830_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="533076346_ef3273c830_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1">We should expect analogous periods of confusion and loss of direction to punctuate the lives of every employee. We are not automatons, but highly complicated volatile collections of protein that need careful and sympathetic administering. The good, mature corporation makes room for the fact. They see their task not as that of shepherding an army of the mentally invulnerable, but rather of stopping periods of angst from turning into full-blown disasters.</p>
<p class="p1">A lot of large companies now recognise the need for a gym. They realise there isn’t a conflict between health and working hard. Stretching your biceps of course doesn’t have direct, immediate pay offs for work. But there’s an acknowledged correlation between being a good employee and taking time to administer to the needs of the body.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6307273092_83c436a5ba_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/6307273092_83c436a5ba_b.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="6307273092_83c436a5ba_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something similar must eventually develop around mental health. Setting up an employee gym for the mind, otherwise known as a therapy centre, wouldn&#8217;t directly close a deal or pep up a presentation. But it would signal that a company understands and affords legitimacy to the needs of the emotional self. We need companies that can calmly take on board the idea that total sanity won&#8217;t be possible for any of us all the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>II. Sensitive Souls</strong></p>
<p class="p1">Human beings are astonishingly sensitive creatures. Our ears can pick up sounds between 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz: which means anything from the rustling of a sheet of paper in the room next door to the minute sound of water dropping into a can five floors away. Our eyes are no less acute, with a capacity to detect a luminance range of 1014, or one hundred trillion (100,000,000,000,000) (about 46.5 f-stops), from 10−6 cd/m2. At the end of our fingertips are 2,500 receptors per cm2, ready to appreciate the contrast between Central American cotton (gossypium hirsutum) and its slightly smoother Egyptian cousin (gossypium herbaceum). As for the 40 million olfactory receptor neurons in our noses, they can distinguish between one trillion different odors. The memory storage capacity of our mind is no less prodigious: the brain contains one billion neurons, each of which makes around 1,000 connections with other neurons, resulting in a total network of a trillion connections. Our computers may be impressive, but our brains continue to be more so, for they can hold about 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes) of memory: which means that if it worked like a video recorder, you’d need to leave the TV on for 300 years to fill up your mind.</p>
<p class="p1">These capacities have been wonderful for politics, engineering, chemistry, biology &#8211; and especially for art, where the results of human sensitivity are perhaps easiest to notice and marvel at. Only an animal as well sensorily-well-equipped as we would have bothered to arrange the 10,000 pieces of coloured glass that go into the large rose window of Chartres cathedral.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://hearttoharp.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/chartreswindow.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="539" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Rose window in the Notre Dame cathedral, Paris</h6>
<p>Or would have been able to manipulate five different kinds of blue to produce an extraordinarily life-like sleeve, as Titian did:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.wga.hu/art/t/tiziano/10/21/01bluesl.jpg?resize=456%2C559" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">Titian&#8217;s Portrait of a Man</h6>
<p class="p1">Only an animal of dazzling neuronal complexity would be able to read (let alone write) a passage like the one below from Marcel Proust’s <i>In search of Lost Time</i>, where the central character, Swann, finds himself deeply moved by a piece of music:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>But tonight, at Mme. Verdurin’s, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth—and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend’s drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in </em><em>the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann’s features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown &#8211; and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil’s sonata for the piano and violin.</em></p>
<p class="p1">This is the good side to being human. Unfortunately, we buy our sensitivity at a very high price. Our capacity to notice, remember and imagine so much is responsible both for the glories of civilization and for an awful lot of everyday frustration and stress.</p>
<p class="p1">Marcel Proust was driven almost to madness by his sensitivity. The writer Andre Gide once described him (with compassion) as ‘a man born without a skin.’ He was capable not only of arranging words with superlative grace on the page, but also of hearing noises three apartments below his (requiring him to line his bedroom with cork) and of suffering from a difference in altitude between Versailles and central Paris (83 meters).</p>
<p>Even when we’re not Proust, we notice rather too much. Moment by moment you might be aware of a sound in the next room, traffic outside (a car slowing down, another going over a speed hump, the tiny variation in sound as a vehicle turns a corner); you’re aware there’s a meeting coming up next month that needs special attention, that you’ve got to pick up the dry cleaning tomorrow; that you never heard back from X; that Y didn’t smile this morning; that the take-away coffee was a bit weak and your brain feels a touch slow; that’s there’s a slightly dry patch on the roof of your mouth, that your left shoulder feels tense, that you never heard back from Z, that there’s a package waiting for you at home, that you wish you don’t really like the shoes you are wearing … The list could be extended indefinitely.</p>
<p class="p1">Stress is the over-stimulation of the sensory apparatus. Because stress is so unpleasant, it’s tempting to hate ourselves for suffering from it and to see it as some form of unique curse or personal weakness. But at the level of our very organs, we are creatures fundamentally predisposed to over-stimulation. Stress is intimately bound up with our strengths, it’s a weakness related to our talents as a species. That we are prone to mania, can’t sleep, feel weary, crazy or burdened by strange thoughts is not unusual or motive-less: it’s a logical outcome of, and a heavy price we all have to pay for, our astonishing mental capacities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In the modern economy, some of the fundamental obstacles to the growth of businesses are related to the mindsets of employees. Enterprise is hampered by a number of psychological quirks that undermine efficiency, energy and harmony. The most hard-headed capitalist therefore has good incentives to address the psychological needs of those they have hired.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few of the many emotional problems that undermine the daily performance of staff:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/150782900.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5712" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/150782900.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="Shadow of a woman on a frosted glass pane, Symbolic photo to the topics: anonymity, fear, uncertainty, unsteadiness, personal secrets etc." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Denial</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine a business with a complex logistics system behind it. There’s a problem developing with a supplier. However, the person dealing with this is prey to the phenomenon known as denial: that means he doesn’t pass the news up the management chain. Instead, he buries the bad news. Two weeks later, it’s become a major problem and everyone knows about it – too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The denier is in the grip of an unconscious belief that it is always too dangerous to pass on disturbing information. This habit of thinking typically has roots in early experience. Long before an unfortunate protectiveness was directed at their boss, it was a pattern required by an important early figure. For instance, as a child, they are likely to have had to step very gingerly around a fragile or explosive adult, someone who couldn’t bear to be disturbed by uncomfortable truths, giving rise to an overall terror at the consequences of imparting certain kinds of information.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The denier doesn’t trust that powerful people are ever able to absorb and deal confidently with challenging things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, the burier of bad news has an excessively fragile picture of life in general and commerce and enterprise in particular: they think that if things are to work out long term, everything must be positive every step of the way. They have not internalised a vision of business in which it is normal for there to be crises pretty much all the time and for big things to be going dangerously wrong almost every day. They underestimate how much suffering and anxiety is normal in the process of doing pretty much anything impressive. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems that a readiness to face bleak daily possibilities is central to the ability to avoid overall catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You try to point out that it would be great to receive a document a few days ahead of the meeting. You politely suggest that the figures don’t seem to be exactly right. You try to hint that the deadlines are in danger of being missed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the result is an immediate collision and fury. The defensive person interprets a local complaint as a global attack. Nothing about them is right any more, they are being accused not just of failing at this or that task, but of being a fundamentally worthless person. They lash out, weep or threaten to resign. The person who has tried to criticise an aspect of their work isn’t just pointing out a thing or two, in truth, they are out to question their right to exist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/72543792.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5713" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/72543792.jpg?resize=635%2C497" alt="Father discussing poor report card w/daughter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Somewhere in the past of the defensive person lies a trauma around education. They were, at an early age, unable to face their own weakness without a risk of humiliation. They rushed to lay claim to a maturity and competence that they hadn’t in fact fully earned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensive people are perfectionists in flight from the terrors of criticism, and often put in superhuman efforts to make sure they can stay ahead of any negative evaluation. But because no one can ever know everything from the start (especially if they are engaged in complex work), defensive types are guaranteed at some point to run into the feedback they so fear &#8211; despite all their hard work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tragedy is that the defensive person has stopped learning from other people. Their resistance to facing up to ignorance and incompetence is so great, it hampers their ability ever to put up their hand and simply admit they can’t cope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What the defensive person requires is enormous amounts of patience and reassurance. They need to hear they are loved and have a place in the greater scheme of things even if they forgot to send that email – but their behaviour is so proud, brittle and aggressive, they’re unlikely to secure the eulogies and good-will that they crave. Their desire always to be faultless ends up becoming their fatal liability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Social Awkwardness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An employee has the chance to step into a more senior role. It will involve a lot of travel and the need to get strangers on board fast. But they seem unable to tackle the social skills required. They blush when talking to new people, never look anyone in the eye and come across as slightly shifty, surly or even unfriendly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness is at base linked to a mistaken belief about other people: that of supposing that they are more together than in fact they are. The awkward person overrates their own distinctiveness. They don’t accept that other people are – if seen from the inside – bundles of anxieties, strange desires, off-beat thoughts and fluctuating emotions. In other words, everyone is the same. But the awkward person gives too much weight to appearances and so supposes that people who appear calm and confident have no inner turmoil.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/108963361.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5714" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/108963361.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY BEATRICE DEBUT -" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness rests on the idea of being distinctive. It is – in its way – a form of egocentricity. The solution lies in accepting that it is, in the end, entirely normal to be weird, and no reason to greet the world with crippling embarrassment or shame.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Excessive Pessimism </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Businesses thrive on intelligent hope. To get anywhere requires a capacity to focus on the upside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the office pessimist sees it as a mark of intelligence to look past the superficial hopes of others. They’re not thrilled about the new American branch or the online expansion plans. They keep quiet when the new CEO arrives and don’t have much to contribute when the extraordinary opportunities for the Chinese market are outlined.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This conviction of pessimism is, ironically, often a response to excessive hope in the past. Gloominess is a defence against over-excitement – which at some point went very wrong. A way to never suffer the agonies of disappointment is to keep telling oneself – and anyone else who will listen – that failure is inevitable and that things never work out. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187388841.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5715" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187388841.jpg?resize=635%2C524" alt="Carlo Carvaglio, by Sironi Mario, 20th Century, 1933, oil on canvas, cm 199 x 120" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">Mario Sironi,<em> Carlo Carvaglio</em>, 1933</h6>
<p class="p1">Pessimists resist a sense of grandeur. They are gripped by the idea that great things only happen to other people. There is an inner feudalism at work in their psyches that wrongly asserts that they cannot be allowed to participate in anything major.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They’ve learned to keep their head down because they have developed a very frightening picture of ambition: it does not look like a strenuous, sane and intelligent desire to do something very difficult but worthwhile. It seems like grandiose egotistical mania – which it is (of course) usually far from being.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Excessive Optimism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They seem, at first, the most engaging people in the office. They are sure the sales targets can be met. They reassure clients that everything will work out. They have about them an air of buoyancy and bonhomie.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in the subtle internal equilibrium that separates hope from naivety, something has gone wrong. They are beset by a grievous resistance to digging into issues to discover the real troubles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/482267787.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5716" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/482267787.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Mauro Masi smiling" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This attitude gets entrenched when a person has too many traumatic experiences around finding things out. At some key point in their development, it was indeed very disturbing to discover what was really at play below the surface: there might have been disguised money troubles in the family, or a parent who was hiding a serious illness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such wounding experiences give rise to a general reluctance to investigate. The over-optimist isn’t just leaning on the cheerful end of uncertainty, they need everything to be absolutely OK. They worry that everyone needs to be jollied along. They fear that if anyone admits that things are less than ideal, everyone will get depressed. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Manic Independence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, they are a joy to be around. They just seem to get on with the task, not asking anything very much of their colleagues.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But gradually, a darker picture emerges. It isn’t that they are merely competent, they are chronically averse to inviting others to help out on tasks or to lending others a hand. When it comes to praise, they want to be the sole recipient. They know teams are meant to be a good thing. But only in theory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The manically independent person is suffering from a version of sibling rivalry. Their colleagues are viewed as competitors for the attention of a parental boss figure. There is, in their unconscious reading of the situation, not enough love to go around, and they must therefore be sure to shine independently of others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/499291063.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/499291063.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="499291063" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every bit of love given to another is a little less given to them. ‘I can’t be part of the gaggle of other children,’ presumes the manically independent worker, thereby condemning themselves and their team-mates to eventual weakness and mediocrity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">                                                                                        **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The obstacles to productive office life are, in various ways, all versions of emotional immaturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This means that knowing how to run a business at heart involves the challenge of helping employees to be more mature. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It sounds like an odd idea, given that we expect businesses to be engaged merely in practical tasks. But at this point in the evolution of capitalism, the challenges most workers face are, to a large extent, psychological in nature, which means that emotional well-being can’t any longer be seen as merely a luxury or an after-thought. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know well enough how important emotional maturity is in relationships and family life. It turns out that it is no less important at the office. Optimistically, given how long we spend at our desks, it might be that the office won’t just be a place to work, it could – if we use it properly – also be a training ground for a maturity that we can take back out into the world, and put to use in the kitchen as much as in the weekly management meeting.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For most of human history and in almost all places it would have seemed absurd for employers to give their employees personal feedback. It was out of the question that the boss could get together with a member of staff and appraise their work, ask about their feelings, attitudes, hopes and ambitions. The basic relationship was of command on one side and obedience on the other. In teaching, there was a strict separation of master and pupil; there were those who gave the orders and those who did what they were told. And if they were slow to do so, there were plenty of punishments on hand. The most widespread management tool was the whip.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Things have changed today for one central reason. Not because bosses are nicer, but because the tasks of business are more psychologically complex than in the past. There’s been an entirely practical and hard-nosed realisation that to get the best performance, people need to be psychologically in a good place: which means well-motivated, in good spirits, even enthusiastic and eager around the tasks they are doing. This is the only way not to waste a lot of money.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/561977001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5701" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/561977001.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Businessmen At Conference Table" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the past, when much work was purely routine, and dependent primarily on flexing the body, management didn’t care so much about what was happening inside the head of the workforce. An unhappy person can type, or hack coal, as fast as a jolly one; a broken-hearted individual can add figures or stick labels as quickly as one who has a spring in their step. The psychology of the worker or employee didn’t seem like a significant factor in the success of an enterprise. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, however, command is no longer enough. Shouting is ineffective as a way of getting people to perform particular tasks well. The whip has ceased to be useful. Work has changed from being physical or mechanical in character to becoming much more psychological. The task might be to come up with a more intriguing kind of packaging; to get the front of house staff to listen more empathetically to the demands of difficult customers; to get a sales force to believe in the merits of a new product, so they can sell it wholeheartedly; to get an IT manager to be more creative in the way they interact with other sectors of the business. For all these kinds of tasks it becomes crucial to get the employee into the right frame of mind. Their sheer technical skill isn’t enough. Their motives, attitudes, outlook – their character – become important factors in how the business goes. So, even if they don’t especially relish the task, the senior management need to take the mental well-being of the employee very seriously. We have moved from the era of <em>physical management</em> to that of <em>psychological management</em>.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is also a more inspiring idea that can be taken from elite sports. The very best tennis players don’t only spend a lot of time working to perfect their service or backhand crosscourt return. They have long ago realised that the top tournaments are won, in significant measure, in their heads. Their ability to master a range of psychological skills are at the heart of their success. They need to know how to be unruffled by huge pressure; how to handle self-doubt; how to have the confidence to come back after a string of errors&#8230; The great player has a life full of psychological feedback &#8211; and is good around it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The office feedback session is currently our society’s main way of addressing what we can call the <em><strong>Psychological Obstacles</strong></em> to the success of a business. Companies recognise that they need to give feedback on various habits of mind – on the distortions or neuroses of character – that get in the way of good performance and hence of profitability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/161115606.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5694" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/161115606.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="forsale" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In any office, the <strong><em>Psychological Obstacles</em> </strong>of staff will – for certain – include some of the following: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Denial: the manic burying of bad news.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dangerous Independence: the loner who doesn’t share information or who is averse to drawing on the skills and insights of other people. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Disguised Ignorance: the person who tends to hide whatever they don’t know. They give the impression of being entirely on top of an issue, only for it to emerge later that they were very unsure of what they were doing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poor teaching skills: someone who can’t transmit, effectively, what they know to those who need to share it. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poor learning skills: the individual who doesn’t listen properly when something is being explained.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Despair and pessimism: the trait of always anticipating disaster and spreading gloom around the office. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over-optimism and naivety: the resistance to digging into issues to discover the real troubles. Breeziness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Reluctance to accept guidance, because guidance is experienced as humiliating.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A tendency to under-confidence and lack of ambition; the person who doesn’t like to acknowledge the scale of the opportunity: a lack of grandeur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impatience: primarily interested in ticking the boxes fast; they don’t enter into the spirit of the tasks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cynicism: the person who doesn’t believe the company is honourable; they feel the employers don’t care about them: they’re disengaged, resentful and a bit sullen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social awkwardness: a lack of confidence and shame makes people unable to present themselves confidently and with a measure of charm to others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each of these habits of mind is connected to how a project could fail. They are psychological obstacles to prosperity. To be more profitable, you need to crack these. Their collective costs to the economy is quite simply immense. Businesses currently recognises these symptoms, but are generally not at all able to cure them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Feedback was invented to get more out of employees and thereby to lift the productivity and the profitability of the company. But it’s difficult for a number of reasons. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Fear of the Employer</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As an employee, it’s easy to feel that employers are being mean or cruel if they point to a problem. The employee typically is not privy to the range of anxieties and pressures that are going on off-stage. The employer is frantic because the business is facing a very tough year and the employees are making a hash of some major projects. So the person giving the feedback is themselves under pressure. They can’t necessarily be the ideal parent and be endlessly forgiving, generous and patient. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/171163368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5698" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/171163368.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2013 NHL Stanley Cup Final - Game Four" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Defensiveness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s often extremely hard for us to accept negative information about ourselves; to hear that we haven’t met expectations, that there’s a problem with what we’re doing or that we need to change in some way. We easily slip between hearing a local point (about the delivery of a report, the handling of a negotiation) and a global point (about one’s whole life and character). So we readily feel persecuted, upset and deeply hurt by what should really be understood as specific details. Our sensitivity and touchiness is not something that can be overcome by abrasive assertion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">It still isn’t normal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ritual and what is taken for granted helps us cope with tricky things. If it is entirely expected – and a time honoured tradition – that at a certain point people say what they think is wrong with one another, the personal sting of feedback is lessened. It doesn’t feel weird or indecently hostile and frankly scary if someone (at the sanctioned time) says: OK, so there are five things wrong with you… And you know that this happens to everyone: it’s going on in the boardroom as well. But, at present, feedback still has the power to feel persecutory and arbitrary.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">There isn’t enough training</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The human brain is such a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>complicated, strange entity. Trying to adjust a person’s outlook or habits is a little like attempting to perform surgery. Except around surgery the difficulties have long been acknowledged. Removing a cataract, say, is reserved for highly trained experts, working in very carefully designed environments. However, the average company assigns feedback, which is a no less delicate and important task – the task of attempting to sort out someone’s thoughts in their head and reform their character – to an executive who has read a couple of journal articles and, at best, attended a one day seminar in a hotel outside the city. There’s, astonishingly, still not much training. The company doesn’t really take the task of overcoming psychological obstacles seriously – the senior people don’t spend a lot of time talking to each other about how to improve feedback and how highly they regard anyone who is good at it. We’ve broadly accepted the idea that work is a place where you acquire skills. But we’re still only just getting round to the notion that one of the skills – and maybe the most important – is that work is, and has to be, an agent of emotional education, a creator of maturity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Work tests all of us hard: not simply in our technical capacity, but in our ability to face psychological difficulties with some degree of confidence, to accept failure, to be generous to the needs of others, to know our limits and be canny about our strengths. These are not simply assets in the work place. These are the psychological building blocks of good partners in a relationship, of good parents and of mature citizens. Work reveals our psychological flaws and – ideally – educates us to overcome them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Scepticism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Businesses will always contain a lot of people who are very sceptical of anything that isn’t immediately about selling more of the products or cutting costs. There’s an idea of what it is to be serious about business which militates against a psychological approach and that, in the name of rigour and financial maturity, refuses to recognise psychological training as legitimate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dealing well with the psychological obstacles requires a move beyond recognising their symptoms. It requires a map of the real nature of the problems and of their causes. The solution isn’t going to be about presenting a true large insight on one grand occasion (the yearly review), and expecting transformation. That’s because the problems have the character of habits, and changing habits is a different kind of undertaking. The corporate atmosphere will need to be calm, unafraid and very patient.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166796508.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5699" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/166796508.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Puppy Mills, 10 Million Caged Hens Fuel Humane Society?s CEO" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">The psychological dividend </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every business is less successful than it could and should be because of the very much less than ideal states of mind of its employees and leaders. Successfully addressing the<em><strong> psychological obstacles</strong></em> releases a <em><strong>psychological dividend</strong></em>. Depending upon the field of business the psychological dividend, in purely financial terms, is an increased profitability of between 25 and 30 percent. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Feedback may seem at first like a small issue of office routine. But it is a place where we can see the economy of the future starting to emerge. It begins to address the question of the kind of education we need, collectively, in order to get a great economy. We are still at the very early stages of psychological training in the workplace. Businesses have long accepted the need for special education – and know they can’t do it all themselves alongside their normal activities (it wouldn’t occur to businesses to train people to write; they accept there needs to be schools for this sort of thing). In the utopia, all Business Schools would be providing a very thorough and astute emotional education. At the moment, maths and the sciences tend to be most highly valued. This fashion derives from an analysis of what was most missing from business in the past. Today, we can get machines to do the maths. What we are short of is psychological sophistication and health. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is six o’clock on a late-February morning, in a village fifty kilometres from London, in the Berkshire countryside. To define what is painfully coming to an end, thanks to the pitiless insistence of an electronic beep, as ‘being asleep’ doesn’t scratch the surface of what has really been going on for the last seven or eight hours in thousands of different dreams, animated by unexpected faces and emotions.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1863" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteA1.jpg" alt="London, England, Britain - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How quiet the nation was only forty-five minutes ago, and yet how much hair-rinsing, necktie-tying, key-searching, stain-removing, child-goading and spouse-shouting will occur over the next thirty, in homes within a gigantic circle drawn around the English capital, from Folkestone to Aylesbury, from Haslemere to Chelmsford.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually, there comes the scramble for bags and coats and the walk in the chill air to the train station. Once outside, it seems extraordinary that the natural world should still exist and be so apparently undisturbed and serene, so indifferent to human concerns, with a new sky which has wiped away yesterday’s squalls and holds no grudges, a scene of innocent beauty that bolsters any attempt to search within oneself for reserves of resilience and good humour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1864" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteB.jpg" alt="UK Train Travel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p2">The train will be on time, say the screens at the station. On the platform, under Victorian arches almost spongy with the paint of decades, there are advertisements for West End plays and day excursions to historic castles. A plane crosses high overhead, a veteran of a still earlier departure, perhaps with a child on board at this very moment gazing down and seeing, within the circumference of a window, the full extent of the railway line threading its way from the coast to the city. Back on the ground, from a distance, swaying slightly from side to side, its headlamps on and sparks flashing around its wheels, a green-liveried train comes into view, sounding its toy-like horn against a wide horizon.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Entering the carriage feels like interrupting a congregation. The cold air cuts into daydreams which must have begun far up the line. The settled passengers neither look up nor give any other overt sign of taking notice, but they betray their awareness of any new arrival by dextrously readjusting their limbs to allow them to struggle past them to one of the remaining unoccupied seats. The train moves off, resuming its rhythmical clicking along tracks laid down a century and a half ago, when the capital first began plucking workers from their beds in faraway villages.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1865" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteC.jpg" alt="London, England, Britain - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p2">© REX/Mode</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is something improbable about the silence in the carriage, considering how naturally gregarious we are as a species. Still, how much kinder it is for the commuters to pretend to be absorbed in other things, rather than revealing the extent to which they are covertly evaluating, judging, condemning and desiring each other. A few venture a glance here and there, as furtively as birds pecking grain. But only if the train crashed would anyone know for sure who else had been in the carriage, what small parts of the nation’s economy had been innocuously seated across the aisle just before the impact: employees of hotels, government ministries, plastic-surgery clinics, fruit nurseries and greetings-card companies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Newspapers are being read all around. The point is not, of course, to glean new information, but rather to coax the mind out of its sleep-induced introspective temper. To look at the paper is to raise a seashell to one’s ear and to be overwhelmed by the roar of humanity. Today there is a story about a man who fell asleep at the wheel of his car after staying up late into the night committing adultery on the internet – and drove off an overpass, killing a family of five in a caravan below. Another item speaks of a university student, beautiful and promising, who went missing after a party and was found in pieces in the back of a minicab five days later. A third rehearses the particulars of an affair between a tennis coach and her thirteen-year-old pupil. These accounts, so obviously demented and catastrophic, are paradoxically consoling, for they help us to feel sane and blessed by comparison. We can turn away from them and experience a new sense of relief at our predictable routines; we can be grateful for how tightly bound we have kept our desires, and proud of the restraint we have shown in not poisoning our colleagues or entombing our relations under the patio.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Familiar vignettes stream by outside: a power station, a patch of waste ground, a postal depot, a copse of ancient trees, a group of schoolgirls in grey-and-blue uniforms, a band of cumulus clouds spreading from the west, a shopping mall across a motorway, some underwear swaying on a line, and then gradually, the backs of suburban villas, heralding the train’s arrival into central London itself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1867" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-commuteD1.jpg" alt="Commuters Head To Work As The U.K. Economy Continues To Recover" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Employees are already beginning to course through the plate-glass doors of countless offices. They have stepped off railway carriages at Victoria and Farringdon, London Bridge and Waterloo, driven through tunnels, been rattled by diesel buses, run down airport concourses, jogged across parks and cycled over hills and high streets. What varied breakfasts they have eaten, too. Danish pastries, the remains of last night’s curry, sausages, scotch eggs and bowls of Cheerios and Coco Pops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To feel at home in an office is not to notice the strange silver sculpture in the lobby and to forget how alien the place felt on the first day. The start of work means the end to freedom, but also to doubt, intensity and wayward desires. Our ten thousand possibilities are reduced to an agreeable handful. We have a business card which we hand over in meetings and which tells other people – and, more meaningfully perhaps, reminds us – that we have a place in this world and are not just a vaporous transient consciousness in an incidental universe. How satisfying it is to be held in check by the assumptions of colleagues, instead of being forced to contemplate, in the loneliness of the early hours, all that one might have been and perhaps never will be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There might be a meeting scheduled for nine-thirty, leaving time for a muffin and coffee. The start of the day in the office has burnt off nostalgia as the sun evaporates a coat of dew. Life is no longer mysterious, sad, haunting, confusing or melancholy; it is a practical stage for clear-eyed action.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Almost certainly, you’ve been having a bad time at work. In a perfect world, work should do so much for us: lend us purpose and a sense of achievement, offer us meaning and comradeship. But invariably, something goes wrong: our talents feel like they’re not being recognised, the company seems unfit to sacrifice a life for, the day-to-day tasks are mundane and stressful and many in management are like grown-up versions of playground bullies.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2531" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/33501571.jpg" alt="Office Reprimand" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are readily drawn to blaming ourselves for the mess: we were impulsive in our career choices, we were vain and lazy; we haven’t got the drive of a classmate from university (she now runs an empire). Yet for all the truths that self-condemnation might contain, many of the factors that cause our dreams to run into the sand in fact lie outside of our direct control, in the very structure of employment within the capitalist system. To blame ourselves is to misunderstand the nature of reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What follows is a run-through of some of the factors that might explain our unhappiness at work outside of individual failings:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. I’m in the wrong job</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You feel – often on Sunday evenings – that at some point you took a wrong turn. Becoming an architect was, in retrospect, an insane focus for your talents. It was a piece of babyish absurdity to confuse the pleasure of reading magazines with the hell of working on them. At the outset, commercial litigation seemed glamorous; now you know it is an excuse to turn your clients’ entanglements into obscene sums for the partners on the 46th floor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you wonder why you made such momentous errors, the reason is painfully simple: you simply had no idea what was at stake. Long ago, you were left alone with a decision that you had no capacities to address sensibly. And now you are trapped in a cage built for you by a blind 20-year-old version of yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our culture is mesmerised by the experiences of a small number of exceptional people who know from a young age what their talents and inclinations are and how best to direct them in the adult world. These people – the writer, the orchestra conductor, the priest, the scientist – are propelled by a calling and apparently guided by the hand of destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impressed by these characters, our societies have fallen prey to the charming but reckless democratic idea that everyone has a professional destiny – and should be left alone to discover it. But, in truth, almost no one does have such a thing. Most of us hover weakly between multiple possibilities; we have no sense of what we would deeply enjoy, what is available and what we would be best suited to. Panicked, we therefore choose blindly, in a hurry, under pressure – and, inevitably, erroneously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before choosing, we are often sent to a career counsellor for a session or two – in order to decide the nature of our work on this earth for the next 40 years. We spend more time choosing a car or a holiday.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Career counselling should have become one of the major growth-areas of our times. Scientists should be competing to develop ever more accurate technology in the field. The stars of the profession should be on television. Yet currently, the job feels on a par with being a brain surgeon in medieval times, a mixture of quackery and guess work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2532" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1982315a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© REX</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, we stumble and drift – or rush headlong into a career on the basis of uncertain insights. What happens as a result is not principally our fault. We are just very poorly advised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. This is just meaningless</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every day, in large corporations, people daydream about leaving to run a little B&amp;B somewhere in the countryside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It mostly remains a fantasy (fortunately), but it’s one that all the same tells us something very important about what we want from work. We long to find it meaningful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work becomes meaningful whenever we feel in some way able to help another human being to be happier through our labour, either by reducing their suffering or by increasing their pleasure. It may be a major intervention, like repairing a heart valve. Or it could be a minor one, like bringing them a cup of tea, showing them a sunny spot in the garden or suggesting a great place for dinner nearby.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Almost all corporations make promises about happiness to their customers. But the demands of Profit have a grievous tendency to conflict with the Promises of Happiness. From a corporate point of view, it makes perfect sense, for instance, for a computer company to design obsolescent software or for a biscuit company to soak their products in glucose. It’s the logic of the market. But from the point of view of employees, it is disastrous at the level of meaning.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A business can only feel meaningful when its employees are able to take a degree of pride in what the entity is setting out to do. The tragedy of most businesses is that their true objective – their deepest aim – is not to help or be genuinely useful, but first and foremost, it is to reward their shareholders, a goal which employees must always rightly resent sacrificing their lives for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. What have I achieved today?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We reach the end of the working day and wonder what we have really done. We are one of 15,000 people in an organisation on three continents working on projects that will come to fruition in five years time. The vast time horizons and huge corporations of modernity contribute to destroy any tangible impression of being able to make a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the olden times, it was easier on this score. In a matter of hours, the cobbler could produce the shoes that he would see other people walking about in with satisfaction for months afterwards. The baker produced the rolls in the middle of the night that were sold at breakfast time, lending him a direct feeling of the way his work impacted positively on the lives of his neighbours.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, for reasons first explained by Adam Smith in the latter part of the 18th century, that way of experiencing work has disappeared from modern economies. Capitalists recognised that it would be a great deal more profitable for them to split the tasks formerly done by one person in a single day into hundreds of tasks carried out by thousands of people over whole careers. The age of specialisation had begun and with it, gradually, the mania for incomprehensible job titles: Logistics supply manager, Packaging coordinator, Communications and learning officer…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certainly things have grown more efficient. Customers get things more cheaply. Profits have risen. But for most of those working in the businesses themselves, it has become ever harder to feel what the point of work might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The regional deputy packaging manager of a gargantuan biscuit manufacturer is in truth connected by precise steps to the moment when a customer consumes a chocolate biscuit with her morning tea. But the extreme specialisation of work means that neither the employee, nor anyone else in the firm, ever really feels that they have made the decisive difference to the tea-break of a customer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Why are my salary and benefits so low?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crucial promise of Capitalism is that things will be cheap. Competition looks great when we want to pay less for an air ticket to Toronto or for a ready-made penne chicken alfredo. But if you are the cabin crew or a chicken farmer, competition is misery. Bargain prices mean less security, fewer benefits and lower pay scales.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There might be other ways. Governments could insist on minimum prices, determining a level that ensured decent employment and products. A single egg, for instance, might have to cost 35p if a chicken were to be properly fed, and live in an adequate environment and if the farmer and his team were to make a proper living. At present eggs sell at 16.3p. We call it a ‘bargain’: a euphemism for someone else taking on an unfair burden of suffering.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other solution would be public education. The economy is ultimately driven not by businesses but by consumers. Corporations just supply whatever customers are willing to pay for. There’s a mass market in cheap eggs because so many people don’t much care about the suffering of chickens and farmers. But what people care about is not a dictate of nature. It can change. We can be led to weep over the fates of strangers and feel sympathy for subjects we might previously have never known existed. Our behaviour is a cultural creation, open to education – and through education, someone might come to the conclusion that they fervently wouldn’t want to breakfast on an egg from a bird that had been manhandled by a degraded workforce.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. There’s too much to do</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so busy. If we stop for a moment, we feel guilty. We can’t relax in the evening – except with too much alcohol. We are constantly emailing and checking websites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2537" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481206595.jpg" alt="Social Media Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to blame the technology which keeps us on call all the time. But there’s something beneath our addiction to technology: fear.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are busy because we are afraid and we are afraid for good reasons. We stick to our desks because it appears, and may even be, excessively dangerous to leave them. We experience life as something akin to a battle. The suggestion that we relax and take more holidays can sound as though a medieval knight were being advised to take his helmet off during combat and enjoy a picnic comfortably within range of the enemy archers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world is so deeply competitive, the penalties of underperforming are so harsh, an addiction to work is not an unreasonable response.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The workaholic doesn’t need to be upbraided for their compulsive behaviour, as they often are (particularly by spouses). They require sympathy; they need the rational basis of their anxieties to be respected. Though people’s excessive commitment to work may place an intolerable burden on their health and their relationships, it sadly isn’t unreasonable. The constant commitment is the logical consequence of a murderously competitive commercial environment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. I can’t bear my colleagues</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every job requires interactions with people who, given a free choice, we would carefully avoid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are all easily hurt. We might not be keen to admit it, but a single cruel word or snide remark can throw us off balance for the day. In private life, we can show our wounds. We can complain, we sulk, we argue. But at work, we can do nothing. We are at the mercy of others, with very little protection against low level infringements of our dignity, peace of mind and self-esteem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2538" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rbcm_84.jpg" alt="rbcm_84" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Work makes us submit to power. The person in charge doesn’t have to care about our feelings. We have exchanged our right to communicate our pain for a monthly paycheck.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Why have I been passed over?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are more fantasies of great destinies than there are great destinies themselves. Almost all businesses are structured like pyramids, and every passing year, brings us closer to the summit – or not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2539" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/105698844.jpg" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The structure of corporations writes disappointment into the contract for almost everyone. There can only be one winner in every cohort filled with potential leaders. Who will get the job won’t even hinge on pure talent, there will be no race we can enter and be judged fairly in. It will be shockingly haphazard: who happens to click with a particular board member; who recently had a nice lunch with whom… These are not scurrilous factors; but they are arbitrary enough to be responsible for decades of extraordinary resentment and injury in the hearts of all those who won’t succeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">**                                  **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of these problems can be easily removed. But once we understand their structural nature, we should be allowed to feel communally distraught over, rather than individually persecuted by them – and by all the agonies and stresses that work inevitably directs our way, on this long, wearying day as on so many others.</span></p>
