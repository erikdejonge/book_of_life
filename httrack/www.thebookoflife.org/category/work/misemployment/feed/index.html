				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is common to hear that unemployment has been caused by our genius at mass producing things and systematising processes; we have become so efficient at making goods and generating services, there is now a great deal less work for people to do. We have run out of needs, and therefore, of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the developed world, it may seem as if we simply all have enough now &#8211; enough fridges, clothes and cars &#8211; and, therefore, that consumption has reached a kind of limit &#8211; and employment along with it. As a result, a large share of the population seems fated to have nothing to do other than survive on charity and government hand-outs, for there is simply nothing for them to do: our needs have been met. We may be prepared to grant that unemployment in the undeveloped world is a little different; there’s so much to do there after all, and one can point to factors such as poor skills, corruption, lack of access to finance and bad transportation as the central reasons why employment prospects in these less fortunate lands have been held back. But in the rich world, it can seem as if economies have stagnated principally because we’ve run out of things we want to buy from and sell to one another.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2385966735_fdb4436673_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9203" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2385966735_fdb4436673_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="2385966735_fdb4436673_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, we can always conjur up some vain and unnecessary desires &#8211; yet another fashion fad or more unnecessary phone apps or video games &#8211; but this doesn’t take away from the main thrust of the argument. We’ve run out of true needs &#8211; and that’s why there isn’t enough good, meaningful work about.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this cannot &#8211; on closer examination &#8211; really be true. The rich world remains full of genuine unmet needs and therefore full of honest employment possibilities. To get a sense of the untapped opportunities, we need only think of all the things that make us miserable on a day-to-day basis: behind most of our quotidian frustrations and griefs, entire industries are waiting to be created. There will be no so-called legitimate, deserved unemployment until the day when all our needs have been met or, put another way, until everyone is content and satiated. We’re still rather a long way off this point. The unemployment that currently exists is in no way inevitable or necessary: it is a symptom of our inability to identify and then adequately organise ourselves to satisfy our needs.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14533418893_8afc9d383b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9205" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14533418893_8afc9d383b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C400" alt="14533418893_8afc9d383b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some might say that we know what our needs are well enough; we just don’t have the right technology to meet them. This line insists that what is holding back the development of new industries is first and foremost technological stagnation. Until innovation in technology allows us to fix a fresh range of issues, we must just sit out our days idly and wait for the scientists and engineers to catch up with our needs. This belief is lent credence by all the cases where technological developments did indeed lead to the creation of high-employment industries. We can think of the consequences of the development of the combustion engine, computer code or stem cell treatments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, an absence of technology cannot be held responsible for all the needs we have that are currently going unmet &#8211; and therefore all the unemployment which dogs our societies. We know from history that a great many of our once unmet needs were later fulfilled (with huge implications for employment) in ways that didn’t depend on the development of any particularly radical kind of technology. There may well have been a process of standardisation and industrialisation, but no genius-level scientific fix was needed. In fact, more interestingly, new jobs were created because certain of our needs came into focus; they entered our imaginations as things we wanted; we became more aware of things that were missing in our lives &#8211; and jobs followed on a large scale.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20849391140_255f97f491_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9208" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/20849391140_255f97f491_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="20849391140_255f97f491_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take for example, the development of the enormous industry that surrounds seaside holidays. The sea has been around a long time. Yet it’s only relatively recently that humans have discovered the pleasure of bathing in salt water, then lying on a towel in the warmth for a few hours. Mountains too have been around for a while, but only in the last 200 years have a sizeable number of humans thought of gaining inner peace, health and perspective by going to wander around in them &#8211; with enormous implications for employment. Everything needed to build comfortable sofas has been known for centuries, but it’s only in the 20th century that we’ve seen the point of mass manufacturing furniture on which to loll. The same arguments could be made in relation to other new and enormous industries: those that provide us with sparkling water and toilets, aerobic instructors and marriage counsellors, pop songs and sushi, national museums and children’s playgrounds, football and pizzerias, daily newspapers and gardening centers, management consultancies and insurance firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retrospectively, we can see how difficulties that people once regarded as just part of life, acts of god, were gradually systematically addressed. The satisfaction of latent demands has not been frivolous; awakening them has meant the deployment of intelligence, imagination and kindness: the recognition that certain valuable, even sometimes crucial things for a good life, were missing.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16677352530_fe94e80261_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9214" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/16677352530_fe94e80261_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="16677352530_fe94e80261_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same point holds for us today: we retain many demands that don’t require technology to fill. If we run through some moments of a representative day we can pick up on a wide range of unsatisfied needs. At each point of these moments of dissatisfaction and disappointment we are encountering the early hints of what, in the future, should be major areas of new employment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the following sources of frustration or longing:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the ugliness of most cities and the desire to find nicer places to live</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inability to control our moods</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our failures to sleep very well</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the dramas around our relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our sense that we have wasted our talents at work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our feeling that we don’t have enough good friends or satisfying conversations</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the challenges of raising children</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- our desire to live more communally rather than in our own restricted families</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9017668520_98d5e43401_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9217" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/9017668520_98d5e43401_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="9017668520_98d5e43401_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these anxieties, reservations and disappointments are &#8211; seen from another angle &#8211; emergent demands and if these demands came into full focus, and were properly interpreted, they could generate new &#8211; highly useful &#8211; products and services and many new employment opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think of relationship crises. One or other of you is sullen, then there&#8217;s a painful altercation. Suspicion and disappointment circulate. Voices are raised. A door gets slammed. Someone might end up sleeping on the couch. It’s awful. But we’re accustomed to feeling this is something we absolutely have to sort out ourselves. We don’t as yet treat it like having a broken arm or a faulty boiler: things that are automatically recognised as calling for specialist assistance (and employment). If in the future this latent demand were fully acknowledged, there would be large numbers of jobs connected to helping us in our relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17417282709_c68fec5005_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9219" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/17417282709_c68fec5005_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="17417282709_c68fec5005_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far from being at a late stage of development of the workforce, we have as yet only learned how to meet a small portion of our major needs: only a small proportion of the things that go wrong in everyday life belong within the market as it is currently configured.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The obstacles to the development of the products and services we need &#8211; and hence to the creation of new jobs &#8211; isn’t solely or predominantly technical or financial. The real obstacles are a lack of specialised skills around the identification and then the satisfaction of needs. There are perhaps three areas of skill that need to come together in order for a latent desire to be translated into a profitable and benign business that can generate future employment: Perception, Industrialisation and Persuasion. To look at these in a little more detail:  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">One: Perception </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of need &#8211; like the ones we’ve been noting &#8211; have to be clearly recognised. Underlying insights have to be firmed up; problems have to be seen as issues that can be addressed rather than as painful givens of nature. This is an act akin to artistic creation &#8211; the entrepreneur, like the artist, has to pick up on faint tremors in the human soul, and clearly define their nature and causes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8056046148_df2d458836_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9223" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/8056046148_df2d458836_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8056046148_df2d458836_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two: Industrialisation</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then come the challenges of industrialising and systematising solutions. It isn’t enough to cobble together responses. One has to create organisational flow charts, carefully identify job descriptions and scout for the right talent, manage large numbers of employees, research and develop specific products and services, organise finance, meet deadlines, cajole business partners, deal with complex regulatory and tax requirements, keep costs under control and be intensely focused on efficiency, competitiveness and profit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three:  Persuasion</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But none of this will work unless enough people can realise that they do in fact need a particular service or product. This means getting large numbers of people to recognise a problem as one they have &#8211; and to feel excited by the idea of a solution. They have to be moved not only to admit this is an area of difficulty but also to have a basically optimistic orientation. The relevant skill, here, is consciousness raising: getting others to find an appetite in themselves.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14154227507_8cb318a166_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9221" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/14154227507_8cb318a166_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="14154227507_8cb318a166_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considered separately, all these skills exist, but their integration is highly challenging and elusive. People who are good at perception, are often weak at persuasion and lacking in industrial knowledge &#8211; so their originating insights can’t develop, while people who are good at industrialisation tend to be much less focused on perception. And persuading skills are generally subordinate to industrial abilities. Which means we’re not well placed to create new industries &#8211; and new work. The roadblocks are cognitive; we aren’t thinking properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The search to reduce unemployment and create jobs has normally been focused on bluntly economic levers: keeping down inflation, tax breaks, regional support, the reduction of red tape around taking on new employees. But we can see another larger prior factor: the need to cultivate a particular mentality in which imaginative and executive skills are united. Unemployment is a tragedy that stems from our inability to understand ourselves well enough, then properly exploit what we have realised about our needs with the use of managerial and financial discipline.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the UK, and some other parts of the developed world, unemployment continues to fall – if only very slightly. It’s good news. It’s something to cheer that productive forces in the economy are growing and that there is a little more money in people’s pockets.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if one gets more ambitious about human potential, a darker picture emerges – darker than that suggested by the figures from government bodies like the UK Office of National Statistics.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2624" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentA.png" alt="PM-210214-unemploymentA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">UK unemployment (ILO) February 2014 © CESI</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should draw a further distinction. Employment means being, generically, in work. But misemployment means being in work but of a kind that fails to tackle with any real sincerity the true needs of other people: merely exciting them to unsatisfactory desires and pleasures instead. The way Primark, Patek Philippe and youporn.com might.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4335" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-210214-unemploymentB.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Nathan's Famous Hot Dog re-opens in Coney Island, New York, America - 23 May 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Dressing up as a hotdog to entice customers: misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A man employed by the casino chain Las Vegas Sands to hand out flyers to tourists so as to entice them to use slot machines is clearly ‘employed’ in the technical sense. He’s marked as being off the unemployment registers. He is receiving a wage in return for helping to solve some (small) puzzle of the human condition of interest to his employers: that not enough tourists might otherwise leave the blue skies and cheerful bustle of a south Nevada city’s main street to enter the dark air-conditioned halls of an Egyptian-themed casino lined with ranks of ringing consoles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5975684097_da7c929170_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6897" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5975684097_da7c929170_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="5975684097_da7c929170_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Misemployment in the logistics industry</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The man is indeed employed, but in truth, he belongs to a large subsection of those in work we might term the ‘misemployed’. His labour is generating capital, but it is making no contribution to human welfare and flourishing. He is joined in the misemployment ranks by people who make cigarettes, addictive but sterile television shows, badly designed condos, ill-fitting and shoddy clothes, deceptive advertisements, artery-clogging biscuits and highly-sugared drinks (however delicious). The rate of misemployment in the economy might be very high.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2627" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentD.jpg" alt="This photo shows 11 June 1999 the exterior of Prix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Architects and construction workers were misemployed here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while we may be genuinely grateful for a job and give our best to do it well, at the back of our minds we do – as employees – nurture the hope that our work contributes in some real way to the common good; that we are making, modestly, a difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not just the most dramatically harmful kinds of work that register as misemployment. We intuitively recognise it when we think of work as ‘just a job’; when we sense that far too much of our time, effort and intelligence is spent on meetings that resolve little, on chivying people to sign up for products that – in our heart of hearts we don’t admire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Economists and governments have, with moderate success, been learning techniques to reduce the overall rate of unemployment. Central to their strategy has been the lowering of interest rates and the printing of money. In the language of the field, the key to bringing down unemployment has been to ‘stimulate demand.’</span></p>
<p class="p1">Though technically effective, this method fails to draw any distinction between good and bad demand and therefore between employment and misemployment.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2628" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-210214-unemploymentE.jpg" alt="INDIA-BRITAIN-ECONOMY-AUTO-BOLLYWOOD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Headlamp designers, paint engineers and models: all misemployed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, there are real solutions to bringing down the rate of misemployment. The trick isn’t just to stimulate demand per se, the trick is to stimulate the right demand: to excite people to buy the constituents of true satisfaction, and therefore to give individuals and businesses a chance to direct their labour, and make profits, in meaningful areas of the economy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a nation properly concerned with misemployment, the taste of the audience would be educated to demand and pay for the most important things. 20 per cent of the adult population might therefore be employed in mental health and flourishing. At least another 30 per cent would be employed in building an environment that could satisfy the soul.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1">Not yet gainfully employed</h5>
<p class="p1">To achieve such a state, it isn’t enough to print money. The task is to excite people to want to spend it on the right things. This requires public education so that audiences will recognise the value of what is truly valuable and walk past what fails to address their true needs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not suggesting the employment figures are irrelevant – they matter a great deal. They are the first thing to be attended to. All the same the raw figures mask a more ambitious index: are we deploying human capital admirably?</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the few ambitions shared by politicians across the political spectrum is that of creating a fully meritocratic society, that is, a society in which all those who make it to the top do so only because of their own talents and abilities (rather than thanks to unfair privilege: upper-class parents, a friendship with the boss etc.). Throughout the Western world, all governments have (in theory!) the common goal of trying to create a hierarchy based on actual ability, replacing posh, chinless halfwits with the meritorious, wherever they may be found and whatever age, colour or gender they might be.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This meritocratic ideal has brought opportunity to millions. Gifted and intelligent individuals who for centuries were held down within an immobile, caste-like hierarchy, are now free to express their talents on a more or less level playing field. We have largely turned the page on a western world that was once filled with rulers who were too sick or stupid govern, lords who couldn’t manage their estates, commanders who didn’t understand the principles of battle, peasants who were brighter than their masters and maids who knew more than their mistresses. No longer is background an impassable obstacle to advancement. An element of justice has finally entered into the distribution of rewards.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is, inevitably, a darker side to the idea of meritocracy: for if we truly believe that we’ve created (or could even one day create) a world where the successful truly merited all their success, it necessarily follows that we have to hold the failures exclusively responsible for their failures. In a meritocratic age, an element of justice enters into the distribution of wealth, but also of poverty. Low status comes to seem not merely regrettable, but also deserved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, succeeding financially (without inheritance or contacts) in an economic meritocracy endows individuals with an element of personal validation that the nobleman of old, who had been given his money and his castle by his father, had never been able to feel. But, at the same time, financial failure has become associated with a sense of shame that the peasant of old, denied all chances in life, had also thankfully been spared. The question of why, if one is in any way good, clever or able, one is still poor becomes infinitely more acute and painful for the unsuccessful to have to answer (to themselves and others) in a new meritocratic age.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There has turned out to be no shortage of people willing to answer the question on behalf of the poor. For a certain constituency, it is clear (and perhaps even scientifically provable) that the poor owe their position to their own stupidity and degeneracy. With the rise of an economic meritocracy, in certain quarters, the poor have moved from being described as ‘unfortunate’, the target of the charity and guilt of the paternally-minded rich, to being described as ‘failures’, fair targets of contempt in the eyes of robust self-made individuals, who are disinclined to feel ashamed about their mansions or shed crocodile tears for those whose company they have escaped. In the harsher climate of opinion that can gestate in the fertile corners of meritocratic societies, it has become possible to argue that the social hierarchy rigorously reflects the qualities of the members on every rung of the ladder and so that conditions are already in place for good people to succeed and the dummies to flounder – attenuating the need for charity, welfare, redistributive measures or simple compassion.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was the sociologist Michael Young who first explored the downside of a belief in a supposedly just social system. ‘Today all persons, however humble, know they have had every chance,’ he explained in The Rise of the Meritocracy. ‘If they have been labelled “dunce” repeatedly they cannot any longer pretend…  Are they not bound to recognise that they have an inferior status, not as in the past because they were denied opportunity, but because they are inferior?’ To the injury of poverty, a meritocratic system has added the insult of shame.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a symptom of our greater faith in meritocracy that it’s largely become impossible to explain away our failures as the result of ‘bad luck.’ While it is granted that luck maintains a theoretical role in shaping the course of our careers, the evaluation of people proceeds, in practical terms, as if they could fairly be held responsible for their biographies. It would seem unduly (and even suspiciously) modest to ascribe a victory to ‘good luck’ and, more importantly in this context, pitiable to blame defeat on the opposite. Winners make their own luck, insists the modern mantra: which would, for example, have puzzled the ancient Roman worshippers of the Goddess of Fortune. It is alarming enough to have to depend for our status on contingent elements. It is harder yet to live in a world so imbued with notions of rational control that it has largely dismissed ‘bad luck’ as a credible explanation for defeat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But of course, there never can be a truly meritocratic system, because the ‘merit’ of an individual is far too complex and subtle a thing to be determined by what job you have. Those who have faith in meritocracy are essentially subscribing to an insane, and certainly arrogant assumption that ordinary humans (employers, customers) can handily take over the solemn responsibilities that past ages more wisely left in the hands of a God who, helped along by the angels, was due to weigh the souls of each person on the Day Judgement.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To free ourselves from some of the more punishing side-effects of a meritocratic worldview, it would be wise to cease investing something as haphazardly distributed as jobs and money with moral connotations – and to retain a little of the old-fashioned, modest belief in a distinction between what someone earns and what their souls are like.</span></p>
