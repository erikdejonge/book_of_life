<p>For Romantics, compromise in a relationship sounds so boring. Ideally, they think partners should love everything about each other. That&#8217;s kind of a pity – given that learning the art of compromise is the most romantic thing you&#8217;ll ever do, the secret to enduring love.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, you felt burdened with thoughts, feelings and opinions that didn’t seem to make much sense to anyone else. You sometimes wondered if you were going mad. There were people you didn’t like, but everyone else seemed to think they were terrific and so you held your tongue. You got anxious and uncomfortable on social occasions when everyone else seemed happy and relaxed. There were things you would have quite liked to try in bed, but they felt shameful and you would not have dared to mention them even to your best friend. You learnt to keep secrets in order to be liked.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then finally, you met a very special person. What made them so special was that, at long last, you no longer had to dissemble around them. You could admit to important truths. You could confess, and be rewarded for sharing, your deepest self. It was a favourite game in those early months. You pushed yourself to go as far as you could go. The deeper the secret, the better. No area of the self seemed beyond investigation, no secret too shocking or explicit. You could explain that you found a mutual acquaintance arrogant, narcissistic and mean. Or that you thought some supposed ‘masterpiece’ of a book very boring. You could explain that you liked pulling hair during sex or had always been excited by ropes. Love seemed to be born out of this new possibility for honesty. What had previously been taboo gave way to exhilarating intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7289983774_432bf0b7de_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7852" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7289983774_432bf0b7de_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7289983774_432bf0b7de_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relief and excitement at unburdening ourselves of all the secrets that life in society demands is at the heart of the feeling of being in love. It is almost as if being in love is the ability to show someone who we really are. This sense of mutual conspiracy underlies the touch of pity that every new couple feels for the rest of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this sharing of secrets sets up in our minds – and in our collective culture – a powerful and potentially problematic ideal: that if two people love one another, then they must always tell each other the truth about everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4470" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait1.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">In his Confessions, the French writer Jean Jacques Rousseau argued that we owe it to one another to be completely honest about our experiences. It’s a sign of corruption to put up facades. Real people are direct, they can own up to who they really are. Even if Rousseau didn’t quite live up to this ideal himself, he presented it so eloquently and seductively that it has become common sense. The idea continues to be an influence on your relationship to this day.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, inevitably, there came a moment of crisis. Perhaps you were in a restaurant, sitting with your lover, the beloved person who had joined you in your innermost convictions about the right way to cook pasta, the nicest places to visit in Italy, the best way to perform cunnilingus and the merits of Salman Rushdie’s novels. And now with equal confidence and trust – in the spirit of having no more secrets – you mentioned that you were a little turned on by the fascinating character reading a book in a corner table on their own. But, on this occasion, there was no more conspiratorial smile and shy but decisive agreement. There was no eager leaning forward, no whispered corroboration. Just a slightly pained, quizzical look from the partner, the trusted recipient of every secret to date. Perhaps it wasn’t even around sex. Maybe on a Sunday morning, you were reading a review of a new biography of Margaret Thatcher, and the left-wing critic’s words struck you as a little harsh and you said so, but at once you got the sense that this was a topic on which no quarter could be given. Even a trace of sympathy for the former British Prime Minister was simply an impossibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are up against a fundamental conflict within the modern understanding of love. Keeping secrets seems like a betrayal of the relationship. At the same time, the complete truth would appear to place the union in mortal danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"> <a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/16660433558_c413bb13c1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7853" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/16660433558_c413bb13c1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="16660433558_c413bb13c1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Jake Stimptson</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of honesty is sublime. It presents a deeply moving vision of how two people can be together and it is a constant presence in the early months. But there is a problem: we keep wanting to make this same demand as the relationship goes on. And yet in order to be kind, and in order to sustain the relationship, it ultimately becomes necessary to keep a great many thoughts out of sight. We are perhaps too conscious of the bad reasons for hiding something; we haven’t paid enough attention to the noble reasons why, from time to time, true loyalty may lead one to say very much less than the whole truth. We are so impressed by honesty, we have forgotten the virtues of politeness, this word defined not as a cynical withholding of important information for the sake of harm, but as a dedication to not rubbing someone up against the true, hurtful aspects of one’s nature. It is ultimately no great sign of kindness to insist on showing someone one’s entire self at all times. Repression, a certain degree of restraint and a dedication to editing one’s pronouncements belongs to love as much as a capacity for explicit confession. The person who cannot tolerate secrets, who in the name of ‘being honest’, shares information so wounding it cannot be forgotten, is no friend of love. Just as no parent tells a child the whole truth, so we should accept the ongoing need to edit our full reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And if one suspects (and one should, rather regularly, if the relationship is a good one) that one’s partner might be lying too (about what they are thinking about, about how they judge one’s work, about where they were last night…), it is perhaps best not to take up arms and lay into them like a sharp relentless inquisitor, however intensely one yearns to do just that. It may be kinder, wiser and perhaps more in the true spirit of love, to pretend one simply didn’t notice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche187c1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4473" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche187c1.jpg?resize=635%2C531" alt="Nietzsche" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Friedrich Nietzsche departed from philosophical wisdom as it had been defined hitherto by insisting that the truth is not always the most important thing for us to be concerned with. What matters is what we are able to do with what we know: one can use the truth to damage someone, or one can use it to help. This should determine the degree of our dedication to it. We don’t have to tell each other the truth all the time unless it genuinely helps us to accomplish our goals. In Nietzsche’s words, often it really does not: ‘We need art’ (that is, strategic deceptions) ‘lest we die of the truth.’</span></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aw14_tsol_website-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3792" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aw14_tsol_website-2.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="aw14_tsol_website-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott developed the idea of a Transitional Object. He wanted to draw attention to the very important work done by children’s much-loved teddy bears. At first a baby feels fused with the mother. But gradually a child will become independent, able to live successfully alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How does one manage this transition? A teddy bear can help by being a bit like the mother – a source of tenderness and sweetness and comfort. And yet, it is really the child who gives the bear these qualities. So the bear is a lovely thing: a halfway house, a resting place between the utter dependency of the baby and the emotional independence of the adult. But we don’t ever entirely resolve this problem. We are always, to some extent, in transition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we recognise that the demands of independence are getting a bit too much – when we’ve had to be too adult, too sensible, too reliable for too long – we need to let ourselves be dependent and insecure. This transitional object is named Donald in honour of Mr Winnicott, the first person to think with appropriate depth about the value such a creature might have for us. He was created in collaboration with designer Donna Wilson by a team at The School of Life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern societies are deeply invested in the idea of big, glamorous weddings. We have evolved highly-detailed collective ideas about what a proper wedding is supposed to be like, down to the specialised floral arrangements, seat covers, presents for bridesmaids and the correct order of the speeches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1278" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486957427.jpg" alt="I do." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These belong to our culture’s current way of expressing the notion that a wedding is an important event in terms of the success of a marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the results don’t seem very encouraging: the link between the quality of the wedding and that of the subsequent relationship is tenuous at best. However grand the ceremony might be, marriages break down at an alarming – yet predictable – rate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1279" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1902387a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we know as the wedding day emerged historically out of a variety of motives: it was an event designed to show off one’s status, to embed one in the community, to invite God to witness one’s union… These ambitions don’t now feel particularly relevant. Therefore, it’s sometimes argued that we don’t need wedding ceremonies at all. Let’s junk the whole idea. We don’t need to waste so much money and go to so much trouble. A piece of paper at the registry office would be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this seems to overlook the benefit of rituals. In theory, rituals serve a hugely important function, for they orchestrate and give public expression to a sequence of emotions and actions that it would be too tricky for any one set of individuals to arrive at on their own. They give structure to interior life – and best reveal their advantages in religious rituals like the Jewish Day of Atonement or the period of mourning known as ‘iddah’ following a Muslim funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90982750.jpg" alt="Ultra-Orthodox Jews Perform Tashlich Ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that the wedding day is – in its current form – an appallingly badly designed ritual. It needs a thorough overhaul, guided by a mature, modern understanding of the underlying purpose of the occasion, which is simply to help a marriage go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, redesigning wedding days sounds odd. We fully accept redesigns and novelty when it comes to technology. No one would think it was a good idea to keep driving a hundred-year-old car. Yet when we’re dealing with social practices, we strangely cling to the ancient with deluded fervour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4315" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg?resize=635%2C488" alt="Back View Of Car With &quot;Just Married&quot; Sign." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do so out of fear: because marriage is such an uncertain business, we quell our anxieties by following what people have always done, attempting to insure ourselves against some new follies we might commit, but thereby ignoring that marriages have been rather catastrophic throughout history and therefore that sticking stubbornly to precedent has all the wisdom of adhering to the methods of medieval plumbing or brain surgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In redesigning the wedding day, we should wipe the slate clean and ask simply: what kind of ceremony would help a marriage to survive? How could one design a day that would make a proper contribution to the maintenance of a union?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The need for new vows</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vows are promises we make on behalf of people who don’t yet exist about circumstances that we can’t yet fully imagine. Still, they serve an important function in at least attempting to guide our responses to the tensions of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with current vows is their optimism, which should be radically tempered, so as to avoid rage and resentment. Vows should accurately anticipate what will make us want to get divorced – and confirm to us that our subsequent sadness will not be an unusual or personal curse. Here is a selection of vows that would be made by a couple in the utopia:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I accept that I am – in countless ways I don’t yet know – very hard to live with.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>We accept not to panic when, some years from now, what we are doing today will seem like the worst decision of our lives.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When you are mean, when you call me a c*** and a fucking bastard, I will strive to remember that at heart, it is because you are hurt – not that you are fundamentally nasty.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Everyone has some very significant things wrong with them. We promise not to look around. There isn’t anyone better out there really. Once you get to know them, everyone is impossible.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1282" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158035124.jpg" alt="Same-Sex Couples Legally Wed in Seattle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Being allowed never to insert one’s penis into a new person, or have someone else new insert their penis into oneself, is one of the tragedies of existence. I apologise that my jealousy and your jealousy have made this peculiar, but entirely necessary self-immolation necessary.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">[Silence from the audience, followed by a melancholy rendition of Pergolesi’s Stabat Mater, during which an asparagus and a lemon, symbols of free sexuality are buried in a three-metre-deep hole in the ground covered with marble or concrete.]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple then repeats: <i>We accept to witness the slow death of our sexuality. We realise we won’t be doing it that often from now on.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I won’t have affairs, not because you’re so perfect, but because I’ve decided to be disappointed by you, and you alone, and you’ll be disappointed by me, and me alone, rather than both of us foisting our troubled selves on innocent members of the community, who would be deeply annoying too once one got to know them.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>[In unison with the audience] Many days we’ll be unhappy; many days, we’ll suffer, many days we’ll regret we ever did this crazy thing. It’s not congratulations we need, it’s commiserations.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Lots of guests</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a growing trend, often driven by financial concerns, towards slightly smaller weddings but a big crowd is, in fact, supremely important (even if the budget only stretches to a sandwich for them later).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One needs a maximum number of people there for a simple reason: so as to cause maximum embarrassment in years to come at the idea of having to call them all up and announce news of divorce. The larger the crowd, the slower one will be to pick up the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/120209645.jpg" alt="Guests arrive for the wedding between En" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This gives due recognition to an important fact about marriage: it’s a social institution, in which we often stay for reasons that go way beyond our own emotional desires. It involves us, but it’s not just about us. It’s about the dog, the children, the grandparents, the friends who got married in imitation of us and whose own relationships would suffer if we split… This sense it isn’t just about us should come as a huge source of relief. There’s nothing harder than to be required to be happy in and for ourselves. What relief to know we will, with time, also be living for others and that our own frame of mind won’t always be such a big deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Different sorts of presents</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian Wedding, the guests would offer the couple different sorts of presents. Primarily, they would arrive with accounts of why their own marriages were difficult and why they were themselves awkward people to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1284" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76590233.jpg" alt="Wedding Ceremony Of Hong Kong Actor Lawrence Ng Kai Wah" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing makes us happier than news of the troubles of others, as these presents would implicitly recognise. At dark moments in the marriage, one would turn to these gifts and flip through descriptions of the marital troubles of one’s friends and relatives – and would come away feeling that one was cursed certainly, but – importantly – in no way alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If single guests were unable to produce such things, they would arrive with vouchers for couples’ therapy, to contribute to the enormous sum that will have to be spent on therapy over the lifetime of any decent marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Speeches</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A typical marriage recognises the key role of parents and gives them a platform. The father of the bride often makes an elaborate speech telling the world how great his daughter is. This is sweet, but in no way protects the daughter he claims to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1285" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1284280a.jpg" alt="USA Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/West Coast Surfer/Mood Board</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents are in command of some vital information that can help a marriage. They know how disturbed they themselves are and the particular family patterns of emotional neuroses which they have witnessed and then unleashed on their own children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wedding day offers a stellar opportunity for the parents of both the bride and the groom to stand up and address their children and their friends on the subject of: ‘The particular ways in which we have messed up the children.’ There would be an added speech on the topic of: ‘How we think our children will be hard to live with, given what we know of them.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This will be crucial information, far surpassing childhood photos and home movies in utility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: A certificate of marriage worthiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, you would get married by a philosopher/psychoanalyst (rather than the two useless current figures, a priest or a local government official). The wedding ceremony would be a passing out celebration for a couple who had been through a substantial course (no less than 12 months) of self-knowledge and mutual education in the psychology of relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic culture suggests that relationships are essentially founded on emotional states: like tenderness, the feeling of missing the other person and sexual passion. This is evidently reckless and in the utopia, there would be a new more logical, classical approach which would recommend strenuous conscious attempts to achieve a mature understanding of love. Many of the skills of marriage would overlap with those of a bomb disposal expert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1286" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/71083487.jpg" alt="Atomic Cake" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the wedding day would be like a graduation ceremony, a culmination of a year of intense study of one of the trickiest and most academic subjects in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Symbols</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The symbols currently associated with marriage (silver horseshoes, bells, white dresses, confetti) can seem to fall somewhere between the merely charming and the obviously superstitious. Few people feel a bridal veil offers robust protection against evil spirits. It’s tempting to think we should jettison symbolism entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the point of a symbol is to make an idea stick in your mind. In the Utopia, the couple would accept small sealed boxes from each other. The box would represent the idea that there will be parts of the other person one will not understand – or perhaps even know – and yet one will have to accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4316" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="William Holden Hiding Present From Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The box would be accompanied by a ‘Tolstoy’ – a brief, but very honest, confession of one’s failings and weaknesses. The Russian novelist gave his wife a written account of his earlier sexual life and an ample description of the flaws of his character, so she would know what she was letting herself in for. The content would be prepared and discussed in the lead up to the marriage; the book would stand for the willingness to listen to – and bear with – one’s partner’s troubles. The exchange of Tolstoys would symbolise a shared ability to cope with the other person’s confusion and distress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Wedding photos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of photos is to bottle the essence of the wedding and make it available to us when we need it later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1288" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1042074x-1.jpg" alt="Carolyn and Fabio wed in the remote village of Airor on the Knoydart Peninsula in the Scottish Highlands, Britain  - 11 Nov 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Angus Blackburn</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a wedding album should not only or even primarily be a visual record of a particular day, and evidence of who was in attendance. The task of the photographer is to create a series of works of art, made on many days, and perhaps not at all on the day of the wedding itself, that would remind the couple of answers to some key questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(i) Why did we get together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(ii) What virtues did we see in one another when we got married?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iii) What impact does each person’s family have on the relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iv) How normal are marital problems in society at large?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking back at one’s ‘wedding photos’ in subsequent years would then take its place within the overall purpose of the wedding: it would help, in a small way, to persuade us to stay married.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a wedding – and the elaborate rituals that surround it – do not at present have our real needs in focus. But that doesn’t mean to say that we’d be better off jettisoning the whole ceremony. We still need ceremony and institutions, just better ones. We should take very seriously – and be collectively ambitious about – what wedding days could and should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian thinking sounds like dreamy stuff. But in truth, one of the uses of Utopian thinking is to move us away from silly fantasy. Instead of seeing the ‘dream wedding’ in terms of palm trees and infinity pools, we should be asking what a wedding would be like if it properly helped marriages to go better. That should give us inspiration as we set about reforming the mediocre marriage practices we currently have</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Perhaps you never had such a figure in your life, but let’s imagine for a moment what a good mother might have been like: when you were a baby, she fed you in the night; you cried at 3am and she got up to comfort you until you eventually found your way back to sleep an hour later. When you had a cold, she brought you toast and soldiers in bed. She was very interested in small things about you, like how you did in the school geography exam or the graze you got on your knee in the running race. Nowadays, she wants you to be happy, that’s what counts. Professional success isn’t the point. And when you mess up, your troubles are hers. She will put her own needs aside for you. She won’t demand that you take her difficulties as seriously as she takes yours.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">
<p class="p2">She applauded even when your efforts were nothing special, yet she won’t remind you of any of it or even expect much gratitude. You are likely to understand – eventually – what she did, but only years later, and maybe too late to return the kindness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an extraordinary image of what love could be. As adults, we often demand this sort of love of each other – and are likely to make a bitter discovery in the process: that we cannot now find again the love we knew as children. We rage against this and blame the other person for their inability to perfectly intuit our needs, until the day we reach a true maturity, realising that the only release from our longing for this sort of love is to stop demanding such love for ourselves and to learn to give it to somebody else, perhaps a child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2089" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-130314-mummyB.jpg" alt="PM-130314-mummyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is one of the most fascinating aspects of religions that they fully recognise the strength of our need for a mummy. In Catholicism, in shrines around the world, the sorrowful, the sad and the desperate will glance up at an image of Mary, light candles, say prayers and speak of their individual griefs to a mother who is symbolically the mother of all believers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/499075211_f85faf748c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/499075211_f85faf748c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="499075211_f85faf748c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From a robustly rational perspective, devotion to Mary seems to exemplify religion at its most infantile and soft-headed. How could any reasonable adult trust in the existence of a woman who lived several thousand years ago (if she ever lived at all), much less draw comfort from a projected belief in her unblemished heart, her selfless sympathy and her limitless patience?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The drift of the question is hard to refute; it is simply the wrong question to raise. The apposite point is not whether the Virgin exists, but what it tells us about human nature that so many Christians over two millennia felt the need to invent her. Our focus should be on what the Virgin Mary reveals about our emotional requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the broadest sense, the cult of Mary speaks of the extent to which, despite our adult powers of reasoning, our responsibilities and our status, the needs of childhood endure within us. While for long stretches of our lives, we can believe in our maturity, we never succeed in insulating ourselves against the kind of catastrophic events that sweep away our ability to reason, our courage and our resourcefulness at putting dramas in perspective and throw us back into a state of primordial helplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At such moments we may long to be held and reassured, as we were decades ago by some sympathetic adult, most likely our mother, a person who made us feel physically protected, stroked our hair, looked at us with benevolence and tenderness and perhaps said not very much other than, very quietly, ‘of course’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be seen, in any way, as babyish, childish or in need of mummy is to risk being scorned as an incompetent adult. Yet the needs are real. And we pay a price for dismissing them. We become desperate and feel very lonely. We might turn harshly on ourselves – getting angry because we feel ashamed of being weak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-130314-mummyD.jpg" alt="PM-130314-mummyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">For their part, Buddhists have evolved the figure of Guanyin for the very same reasons as Catholics invented Mary. She too has kind eyes and can suggest alternatives to despising oneself. In temples and outdoor plazas across the East, adults allow themselves to be weak in her presence. Her gaze has a habit of making people cry – for the moment one breaks down isn’t so much when things are hard as when one finally encounters kindness and a chance to admit to sorrows one has been harbouring in silence for too long. Like Mary, Guanyin has a measure of the difficulties involved in trying to lead a remotely adequate adult life. Guanyin does not act powerfully to solve our problems. The point is that just being heard; feeling that one’s pain is recognised, and taken seriously, is – in itself – a great help. She regards us with tenderness, when no-one else will, and strengthens us to face the tasks of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern society struggles to update what such figures as Mary and Guanyin represent. We don’t have a contemporary version of the publically available nurturing ‘mother’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is easy to label as childish needs which should really be honoured as more generally human, for there is in truth no maturity without an adequate negotiation with the infantile and no such thing as a grown-up who does not regularly yearn to be comforted like a child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity describes the capacity to accept the idea of one’s ongoing child-like nature as a mark of moral and spiritual health. Psychoanalysts would agree. Only the brittle and unnaturally haughty would attempt to deny their weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In religious ages in Europe, images of loving mothers were displayed in multitudes of shrines, temples and churches or on the sides of buildings. So the reassuring, generous message could reach people wherever they happened to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-130314-mummyE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4475" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-130314-mummyE.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="2832750a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we have no problem at all with messages being displayed in public places – only they are more likely to concern the possibility of buying a special kind of sports shoe or advising us on how we can save a bit of money on car insurance. We’ve given over so much of this public terrain to people who are primarily concerned with making money out of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a culture that recognises our common, widespread, deep need for maternal care – and the benefits of being reminded of the need. This is a political task – though it is one that does not (unfortunately) figure on the agenda of any major political party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be useful if architects and artists were occasionally to create works which took parental care as their central theme. Spaces for Tenderness, where we could, in the best sense regress; contemplate maternal images in a twilight ambience, while lying on cushions under the cover of soft woollen blankets of the sort that once swaddled us in our earliest days.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It used to be when you’d hit certain financial and social milestones: when you had a home to your name, a set of qualifications on the mantelpiece and a few cows and a parcel of land in your possession.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10218912636_98775ae40c_k-11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4481" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10218912636_98775ae40c_k-11.jpg?resize=635%2C463" alt="10218912636_98775ae40c_k-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when, under the influence of Romantic ideology, this grew to seem altogether too mercenary and calculating, the focus shifted to emotions. It came to be thought important to feel the right way. That was the true sign of a good union. And the right feelings included the sense that the other was ‘the one’, that you understood one another perfectly and that you’d both never want to sleep with anyone else again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These ideas, though touching, have proved to be an almost sure recipe for the eventual dissolution of marriages – and have caused havoc in the emotional lives of millions of otherwise sane and well-meaning couples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1625" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/162996015.jpg" alt="Fletcher Jones III And Dalene Kurtis Wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a corrective to them, what follows is a proposal for a very different set of principles, more Classical in temper, which indicate when two people should properly consider themselves ready for marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are ready for marriage…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">1. When we give up on perfection </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should not only admit in a general way that the person we are marrying is very far from perfect. We should also grasp the specifics of their imperfections: how they will be irritating, difficult, sometimes irrational, and often unable to sympathise or understand us. Vows should be rewritten to include the terse line: ‘I agree to marry this person even though they will, on a regular basis, drive me to distraction.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/174302513.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/174302513.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Nicoletta Orsomando wearing a wedding dress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, these flaws should never be interpreted as merely capturing a local problem. No one else would be better. We are as bad. We are a flawed species. Whomever one got together with would be radically imperfect in a host of deeply serious ways. One must conclusively kill the idea that things would be ideal with any other creature in this galaxy. There can only ever be a ‘good enough’ marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For this realisation to sink in, it helps to have had a number of relationships before marrying, not in order to have the chance to locate ‘the right person’, but so that one can have ample opportunity to discover at first hand, in many different contexts, the truth that everyone (even the most initially exciting prospect) really is a bit wrong close up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">2. When we despair of being understood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Love starts with the experience of being understood in a deeply supportive and uncommon way. They understand the lonely parts of you; you don’t have to explain why you find a particular joke so funny; you hate the same people; they too want to try out a particular sexual scenario.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1634" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141554915.jpg" alt="Alain Delon And Romy Schneider" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This will not continue. Another vow should read: ‘However much the other seems to understand me, there will always be large tracts of my psyche that will remain incomprehensible to them, anyone else and even me.’</span></p>
<p class="p1">We shouldn’t, therefore, blame our lovers for a dereliction of duty in failing to interpret and grasp our internal workings. They were not tragically inept. They simply couldn’t understand who we were and what we needed – which is wholly normal. No one properly understands, and can therefore fully sympathise with, anyone else.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">3. When we realise we are crazy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is deeply counter-intuitive. We seem so normal and mostly so good. It’s the others…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But maturity is founded on an active sense of one’s folly. One is out of control for long periods, one has failed to master one’s past, one projects unhelpfully, one is permanently anxious. One is, to put it mildly, an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we are not regularly and very deeply embarrassed about who we are, it can only be because we have a dangerous capacity for selective memory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">4. When we are ready to love rather than be loved </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Confusingly, we speak of ‘love’ as one thing, rather than discerning the two very different varieties that lie beneath the single word: being loved and loving. We should marry when we are ready to do the latter and are aware of our unnatural, immature fixation on the former.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We start out knowing only about ‘being loved.’ It comes to seem – very wrongly – like the norm. To the child, it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand to comfort, guide, entertain, feed, clear up and remain almost always warm and cheerful. Parents don’t reveal how often they have bitten their tongue, fought back the tears and been too tired to take off their clothes after a day of childcare. The relationship is almost entirely non-reciprocal. The parent loves; but they do not expect the favour to be returned in any significant way. The parent does not get upset when the child has not noticed the new hair cut, asked carefully-calibrated questions about how the meeting at work went or suggested that they go upstairs to take a nap. Parent and child may both ‘love’, but each party is on a very different end of the axis, unbeknownst to the child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1635" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/176501414.jpg" alt="Bormes-les-Mimosas (Cote d'Azur, French Riviera)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is why in adulthood, when we first say we long for love, what we predominantly mean is that we want to be loved as we were once loved by a parent. We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be ministered to and indulged. In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want, be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, act selflessly and make it all better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is – naturally – a disaster. For a marriage to work, we need to move firmly out of the child – and into the parental position. We need to become someone who will be willing to subordinate their own demands and concerns to the needs of another.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There’s a further lesson to be learnt. When a child says to its parent ‘I hate you’, the parent does not automatically go numb with shock or threaten to leave the house and never come back, because the parent knows that the child is not giving the executive summary of a deeply thought-out and patient investigation into the state of the relationship. The cause of these words might be hunger, a lost but crucial piece of Lego, the fact that they went to a cocktail party last night, that they won’t let them play a computer game, or that they have an earache…</p>
<p class="p1">Parents become very good at not hearing the explicit words and listening instead to what the child means but doesn’t yet know how to say: ‘I’m lonely, in pain, or frightened’ – distress which then unfairly comes out as an attack on the safest, kindest, most reliable thing in the child’s world: the parent.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We find it exceptionally hard to make this move with our partners: to hear what they truly mean, rather than responding (furiously) to what they are saying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A third vow should state: ‘Whenever I have the strength in me to do so, I will imitate those who once loved me and take care of my partner as these figures cared for me. The task isn’t an unfair chore or a departure from the true nature of love. It is the only kind of love really worthy of that exalted word.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">5. When we are ready for administration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic person instinctively sees marriage in terms of emotions. But what a couple actually get up to together over a lifetime has much more in common with the workings of a small business. They must draw up work rosters, clean, chauffeur, cook, fix, throw away, mind, hire, fire, reconcile and budget.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">None of these activities have any glamour whatsoever within the current arrangement of society. Those obliged to do them are therefore highly likely to resent them and feel that something has gone wrong with their lives for having to involve themselves so closely with them. And yet these tasks are what is truly ‘romantic’ in the sense of ‘conducive and sustaining of love’ and should be interpreted as the bedrock of a successful marriage, and accorded all the honour currently given to other activities in society, like mountain climbing or motor sport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1636" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1923778a.jpg" alt="Mid adult man looking at iron over colored background" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A central vow should read: ‘I accept the dignity of the ironing board.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">6. When we understand that sex and love do and don’t belong together</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic view expects that love and sex will be aligned. But in truth, they won’t stay so beyond a few months or, at best, one or two years. This is not anyone’s fault. Because marriage has other key concerns (companionship, administration, another generation), sex will suffer. We are ready to get married when we accept a large degree of sexual resignation and the task of sublimation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both parties must therefore scrupulously avoid making the marriage ‘about sex’. They must also, from the outset, plan for the most challenging issue that will, statistically-speaking, arise for them: that one or the other will have affairs. Someone is properly ready for marriage when they are ready to behave maturely around betraying and being betrayed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The inexperienced, immature view of betrayal goes like this: sex doesn’t have to be part of love. It can be quick and meaningless, just like playing tennis. Two people shouldn’t try to own each other’s bodies. It’s just a bit of fun. So one’s partner shouldn’t mind so much.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1637" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3364132.jpg" alt="Jealous Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But this is wilfully to ignore impregnable basics of human nature. No one can be the victim of adultery and not feel that they have been found fundamentally wanting and cut to the core of their being. They will never get over it. It makes no sense, of course, but that isn’t the point. Many things about us make little sense – and yet have to be respected. The adulterer has to be ready to honour and forgive the partner’s extreme capacity for jealousy, and so must as far as is possible resist the urge to have sex with other people, must take every possible measure to prevent it being known if they do and must respond with extraordinary kindness and patience if the truth does ever emerge. They should above all never try to persuade their partner that it isn’t right to be jealous or that jealousy is unnatural, ‘bad’ or a bourgeois construct.</span></p>
<p class="p1">On the other side of the equation, one should ready oneself for betrayal. That is, one should make strenuous efforts to try to understand what might go through the partner’s mind when they have sex with someone else. One is likely to think that there is no other option but that they are deliberately trying to humiliate one and that all their love has evaporated. The more likely truth – that one’s partner just wants to have more, or different, sex – is as hard to master as Mandarin or the oboe and requires as much practice.</p>
<p class="p1">One is ready to get married when two very difficult things are in place: one is ready to believe in one’s partner’s genuine capacity to separate love and sex. And at the same time, one is ready to believe in one’s partner’s stubborn inability to keep love and sex apart.</p>
<p class="p1">Two people have to be able to master both feats, because they may – over a lifetime – be called upon to demonstrate both capacities. This – rather than a vow never to have sex with another human again – should be the relevant test for getting married.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">7. When we are happy to be taught and calm about teaching</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are ready for marriage when we accept that in certain very significant areas, our partners will be wiser, more reasonable and more mature than we are. We should want to learn from them. We should bear having things pointed out to us. We should, at key points, see them as the teacher and ourselves as pupils. At the same time, we should be ready to take on the task of teaching them certain things and like good teachers, not shout, lose our tempers or expect them simply to know. Marriage should be recognised as a process of mutual education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">8. When we realise we’re not that compatible</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of marriage stresses that the ‘right’ person means someone who shares our tastes, interests and general attitudes to life. This might be true in the short term. But, over an extended period of time, the relevance of this fades dramatically; because differences inevitably emerge. The person who is truly best suited to us is not the person who shares our tastes, but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently and wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate difference that is the true marker of the ‘right’ person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have accepted that it is a truly good idea to attend some classes before having children. This is now the norm for all educated people in all developed nations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1638" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3369718.jpg" alt="Healthy Marriage Initiative Classes Held In Pennsylvania" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Yet there is as yet no widespread acceptability for the idea of having classes before getting married. The results are around for all to see.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The time has come to bury the Romantic intuition-based view of marriage and learn to practice and rehearse marriage as one would ice-skating or violin playing, activities no more complex and no more deserving of systematic periods of instruction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For now, while the infrastructure of new vows and classes is put in place, we all deserve untold sympathy for our struggles. We are trying to do something enormously difficult without the bare minimum of support necessary. It is not surprising if – very often – we have troubles.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">President Obama was out the other week inspecting the navy at the largest US mainland base in Norfolk, Virginia. A month ago, he was out at the Wright-Patterson air force base in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can look rather impressive. He’s in charge. The generals have to do what he says, and they will. Around the world, the tanks, the aircraft carriers, the fighter planes and the combat troops are all waiting for his orders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2080" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyA.jpg" alt="PM-140314-daddyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so painfully aware of what can go wrong when power is abused that we tell ourselves we never like authority. Yet there are important parts of ourselves that want to feel protected; we want someone to be there to anticipate danger, someone to stand in the front line and to confront whatever threats and harms may be lurking in the wider world with a tone of authority and command.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maturity has unfairly come to be associated with an overcoming of all emotions connected to being passive or submissive towards others. So we think that if we are to pass muster as plausibly smart and worldly we have to stress how free we are of any desire to have politicians as guardians of our safety, as father (or mother) figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One way this is expressed is as a reluctance to admire politicians. Admiration is an admission of inequality and of need – it puts you in a vulnerable position. When you admire someone you look up to them, you recognise they can do something you can’t. You might wish you could do it but in admiration you’re honest enough to admit their superiority.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2081" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyB.jpg" alt="Obama 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lodged at the back of our minds are deeply traumatic images of enthusiasm for authority going catastrophically wrong. We think that if we like authority at all we are only a hair’s breadth away from turning into Nazis. This is such a horrible prospect that we understandably want to signal to ourselves and everyone else how very very far we are from it. Trauma (in this case the world’s collective psychological wounds from the 1930s and 40s) means we get terrified by actually perfectly decent things that unfortunately put us in mind of a nightmare we’ve gone through already.</span></p>
<p class="p2">But we need to reassure ourselves of the huge safety margins between admiring authority – wanting to be protected and looked after – and the hysterical worship of a dictator. These two things are not remotely the same. They only look connected because the historical aftershocks are still with us.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s time to recover our confidence; admiration for authority is not always a disaster, indeed it has a role to play in a functioning state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2082" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyC.jpg" alt="Germany Adolf Hitler Troop Review" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The nightmare really is over</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s tempting to think of marriage as old fashioned. Why not just live with someone and be done with it? What need for a public ceremony? Why the weird traditions that people normally keep away from: all those churches, temples, hymns, vows and prayers? Marriage must be a silly relic from the religious childhood of humankind, not designed for the more logical modern world.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1176" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it survives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The essence of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate our wills, to put high and costly obstacles in the way of splitting up. Why do we do this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally, we told ourselves that God wanted us to stay married. But even now, when God is not invoked, we keeping making sure that marriage is rather hard to undo. For one thing, you carefully invite everyone you know to watch you say you’ll stick together. You willingly create a huge layer of embarrassment were you ever to turn round and admit it might have been a mistake. Furthermore, even though you could keep things separate, marriage tends to mean deep economic and legal entanglements. You know it is going to take the work of a phalanx of accountants and lawyers to prise you apart. It can be done, of course, but it will be ruinous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is as if we somewhere recognise that there might, rather strangely, be some quite good, though uncomfortable, reasons why making it difficult to split up a union can be an advantage for its members.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Impulse is dangerous</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Marshmallow Test was a celebrated experiment in the history of psychology designed to measure children’s ability to delay gratification – and track the consequences of being able to think long-term. Some three-year-old children were offered a marshmallow, but told they would get two if they held off from eating the first one for five minutes. It turned out a lot of children just couldn’t make it through this period. It was too tempting; the less immediate benefit of gobbling the marshmallow in front of them was stronger than the strategy of waiting. Crucially, it was observed that these children went on to have lives blighted by a lack of impulse control, and fared much worse than the children who were best at subordinating immediate fun for long-term benefit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1177" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4941627622_44d7178727_z.jpg" alt="4941627622_44d7178727_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships are no different. Here too, many things feel very urgent. Not eating marshmallows, but escaping, finding freedom, running away… We’re angry and want to get out. We’re excited by a new person and want to abandon our present partner at once. And yet as we look around for the exit, every way seems blocked. It would cost a fortune, it would be so embarrassing, it would take an age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t a coincidence. Marriage is a giant inhibitor of impulse set up by our conscience to keep our libidinous, optimistic, desiring self in check. What we are essentially buying into by submitting to its dictates is the insight that we are (as individuals) likely to make very poor choices under the sway of strong short-term impulses. To marry is to recognise that we require structure to insulate us from our urges. It is to lock ourselves up willingly, because we somehow acknowledge the benefits of the long-term.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1178" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wine.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage proceeds without constant reference to the moods of its protagonists. It isn’t about feeling. It is a declaration of intent that it is crucially impervious to our day-to-day desires. It is a very unusual marriage in which the two people don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasising that they weren’t in fact married. But the point of marriage is to make these feelings not matter very much. It is an arrangement that protects us from what we desire and yet know (in our more reasonable moments) we don’t truly need or want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We grow and develop gradually</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At their best, relationships involve us in attempts to develop, mature and become ‘whole’. We often get drawn to people precisely because they promise to edge us in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the process of our maturation can be agonisingly slow and complicated. We spend long periods (decades perhaps) blaming the other person for problems which arise from our own weakness. We resist attempts at being changed, asking to be loved ‘for who we are’, with all our faults – as if this could ever be a good idea…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can take years of supportive interest; many tearful moments of anxiety, much frustration, until genuine progress can be made. With time, after maybe 120 arguments on a single topic, both parties may begin to see it from the other’s point of view. Slowly we start to get insights into our own madness. We find labels for our issues, we give each other maps of our difficult areas, we become a little easier to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/feathers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4485" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/feathers.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="Woman comforting man smoking pipe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It is too easy to seem kind and normal when we go out with someone new. The truth about us, on the basis of which self-improvement can begin, only becomes clear over time. Chances of development increase hugely when we don’t keep running away to people who will falsely reassure us that there’s nothing too wrong with us.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Investment requires security</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the most worthwhile projects require immense sacrifices from both parties, and it’s in the nature of such sacrifices that we’re most likely to make them for people who are also making them for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage is a means by which people can specialise – perhaps in making money or in running a home. This can be hugely constructive. But it carries a risk. Each person (especially if one person stays at home) needs to be assured that they will not later be disadvantaged by this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage sets up the conditions in which we can take decisions about what to do with our lives that would otherwise be too risky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">** **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over time, the argument for marriage has shifted. It’s no longer about external forces having power over us: churches, the state, the legal idea of legitimacy, the social idea of being respectable…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we are correctly now focused on is the psychological point of making it hard to throw it all in. It turns out that we benefit greatly (though at a price) from having to stick with certain commitments, because some of our key needs have a long-term structure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has been on attempting to make separation easier. The challenge now lies in another direction: in trying to remind ourselves why immediate flight doesn’t always make sense; in trying to see the point of holding out for the second marshmallow.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Under such a title, one expects something properly heroic: inter-planetary travel. Perhaps the flotation of a public company. A breakthrough in renal cancer research.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But no, the hardest job you are ever likely to face, the success of which will determine more of your satisfaction from day-to-day than any other, is that of running and sharing a household with another human being you profess to love. Domestic life, properly understood, is the neglected locus of some of the most profound and noble challenges open to any of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1127" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Wall-View-from-an-Apartment.jpg" alt="Wall-View-from-an-Apartment" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of love couldn’t disagree more. It sees finding the right person as the central hurdle of relationships. It is fascinated by, and deeply sympathetic to, the troubles and confusions surrounding the search for a life partner. Getting together with the right partner is the elusive key to a happy shared life, a goal for which one should be ready to sacrifice everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is deeply disturbing then, from the Romantic point of view, to find that a loving couple (people who are truly ‘right’ for one another, who overcame conflict and prejudice to be together) are liable to wind up spending a great deal of their lives – after they have finally found one another – bickering: over the TV remote control, the state of the kitchen work surfaces, each others’ parking technique and who is meant to sweep the floor and when. Standard love stories rarely take us into these challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sink.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4487" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sink.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="Do Not Disturb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big movements of modern times – Capitalism and Feminism – also agree on dismissing the domestic. They both suggest that machines have solved the problems of the home. The dishwasher, the washing machine and the vacuum cleaner have together, at a stroke, apparently overcome the hurdles of domestic strife, allowing the focus to shift to the true battle and interest of existence: the world of paid work. The labour that is done inside the home cannot ever be valuable or serious: which is (they say) why it is unpaid and something women and men should resist being overly identified with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, we don’t ever really accept that household management and division are going to be hard and important. We have no problem grasping that it might be tricky to locate exoplanets, drive a Formula One car, perform surgery on the hypothalamus or increase the earnings per share of a listed company. That’s why disputes around how to do these things feel entirely appropriate. People write position papers, give conference speeches, make submissions to learned academies and produce elaborately argued case studies. They spend many years deliberately acquiring the relevant skills that will eventually enable them to have a decent shot at dealing with such demanding undertakings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1128" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/launderette.jpg" alt="Couple meet at &quot;washateria.&quot;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s startlingly different when we look at domestic activities – doing the laundry, keeping the fridge stocked, cleaning up after meals, making the beds, dusting bookshelves, arranging a rota for the children, deciding what friends to see and when – these are things that we think should just happen in the background of real life. They never demand much thought. They are inherently demeaning. They are mere chores. No one could be meant to do them. It is simply a matter of everyone taking a fair turn at a boring, banal but sadly unavoidable drudgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you expect something to be easy and it turns out not to be, there’s a particular kind of struggle and bad mood that follows. Arguing about who should take out the rubbish, or whether to keep the bedroom window slightly open at night take on a distinctively painful form. Not only are we seriously angry, we can’t take our anger seriously. We fall into that pattern of behaviour typical when a problem hasn’t faced up to its own complexity. One person starts to nag, nagging defined as the repeated unsympathetic hasty attempt to force someone to do something they’re resisting. Nagging doesn’t try to understand or elegantly persuade (as one might if one knew something was hard). It doesn’t start with the assumption that there is a legitimate disagreement over a serious topic that needs head-on discussion – only that the other person is not pulling their weight over something petty and obvious and needs just prodding and poking. Nagging then typically generates its counterpart: passive avoidance or shirking. The shirker doesn’t argue back, doesn’t explain where they are coming from, doesn’t try to think through what is really the matter. They simply try to escape, shut their ears and hope the problem (so boring to both parties) will just go away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mess3.jpg" alt="VARIOUS - 1997" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After too much nagging and shirking, one person or another generally decides to act unilaterally. We just give up trying to talk and, without sympathy for any view other than our own, simply snarl and grab the remote, or get up suddenly and slam the window shut, or go outside and start the car – all symptoms of deeply serious issues that have fatally insisted on their own simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The dominant Romantic approach to relationships will lead us to panic at how difficult domestic life turns out to be. Romanticism feeds a tendency to see practical conflicts as a sign that you and your partner are not right for one another. If you were, you simply wouldn’t be having such immense conflicts over ‘tiny things’: like when it is necessary to use a breadboard,  or whether to leave a light on in the hall at night.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hose.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, through greater realism, the Classical view is more hopeful. It sees the challenges of sharing a space (with all the financial and practical responsibilities that come with it) as being at least as important as finding the right person in the first place. It reassures us that it’s not a sign that someone is wrong for you if you are getting deeply irate about toothpaste speckles on the mirror or if you have seen many an evening ruined by squabbling over the bins. Conflict in these areas is the logical consequence of the difficult tasks we have been accorded.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we admit that sharing a space and a life is very difficult, we come to conflicts with a very different attitude. Yes, we will argue about who puts out the bins, who gets more duvet, what we watch on TV… but the nature of the struggle will change. We won’t necessarily immediately get so impatient and so rude, we won’t nag and we won’t shirk. We’ll have the courage of our dissatisfaction – and patiently sit with a partner for a two-hour discussion (perhaps with Powerpoint) on the sink, better than ten-minute struggles over the next forty years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kitchen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4488" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kitchen.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="Man and woman working in the kitchen, c 1950." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are, each of us, forgivably weird around our domestic habits in ways we have to understand and learn to communicate properly. To one person it may seem that closing the bedroom window at night is just obviously a truly terrible thing. Maybe it was something withering their father said about their spoiled, cosseted cousins who were always complaining about draughts. Maybe it is a lingering effect of their childhood reading of The Famous Five. Reasonable or not, the open window comes to feel extremely important. And the person who takes another view is not merely in error, they are the enemy. Or holding the remote might be for your partner a major move in a life-long struggle for independence. They might not let on, but when you try to take it back you are not only attempting to get hold of a device for selecting channels and altering the volume – you are attempting to reduce them (so they feel) to a condition of infantile helplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should never assume that sitting on a sofa watching television or finding the right temperature in bed will be simple. We should stop the obsessive Romantic focus on ‘emotional’ issues. A good relationship means – almost above all else – a successful relationship around space and administration. When a relationship gets going, we therefore need not only to speak of our emotions and our childhoods, we need extended seminars between couples around dishwashers and laundry baskets, bed-times and ventilation methods. More relationships have foundered over the management of the toilet than over the dynamics of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of this is a sign of failure. It is, on the contrary respectful of the complexity of one of the hardest jobs you will ever take on. We should never fall into the trap of thinking that it must be easy: Romanticism here just condemns us to a lifetime of nagging and stonewalling.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is one of the seven virtues of Christianity. It used to have a central place in Roman ethics and Judaism as well. Today, we remain deeply impressed by the idea of charity, but often from a distance, without probing the concept too deeply, with little attempt to practise it systematically. It’s something we might have recourse to when we’re moved by a documentary on the TV or have some loose change left over after the holidays.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1074" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/timetogive.jpg" alt="Retailers Hope For A Good Christmas Despite The Current Economic Gloom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its most basic, charity means: giving someone something they need but can’t get for themselves. And normally that’s understood to mean something material. We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The heroes of Christianity are exemplars of such charity. Outside the city, Saint Francis comes across a poor man. His garments are thin and ragged. Winter is coming on and coats are expensive. The saint is moved to charity.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4122" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="poorknight1700-616x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about recognising that a person needs help with something that they can’t do for themselves – and that their helplessness is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is part of the human condition. We freely give because we appreciate how often we wouldn’t have made it if other people had not – at key points, in different contexts – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in relationships that charity becomes particularly necessary. Here we don’t generally require the charity of money, cloaks and free meals. What we are short of is charity of interpretation: that is, a charitable perspective on our weaknesses, eccentricities, anxieties and follies – failings that we are unable to explain or win sympathy for, that we merely act out, with immaturity and hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1076" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sweat.jpg" alt="Poor Dad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be that one person in a couple has badly messed up in their professional life. They made a significant decision at work that played out badly. They got severely criticised; there was talk of court action. For months, they were very agitated, and hard to live with. They couldn’t articulate their fears. They were sullen and irascible. Their partner might have added stern admonitions to those of the regulator, the senior management and people on Twitter… They could have concluded that their partner was inept, greedy, maybe a bit unprincipled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead, a charitable soul does the work the partner has not been able to do. They do the explaining for them. They understand enough about their past to have a picture of where their impatience and over-ambition came from. They hold in mind what happened with their parents and with the move to another country and with the brother who died too young. They lend a picture of who the ‘beggar’ is that is sufficiently generous and complex as to make them more than just the ‘fool’ or ‘weirdo’  they could so easily have been dismissed as.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4124" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg?resize=635%2C355" alt="Romantic Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The genuinely charitable person gives generously from a sense that they too stand in need of charity. Not right now, not over this, but in some other area. They know that self-righteousness is merely the result of a faulty memory, an inability to hold in mind – at moments when one is totally right – how often one has been deeply and definitively in the wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charity remembers how there might still be goodness amidst a lot of evil. Charity keeps in mind that if someone is tired and stressed, they are liable to behave appallingly. Charity is aware that when someone shouts an insult they are not usually revealing the secret truth about their feelings. They are trying to wound the other because they feel they have been hurt – usually by someone else, whom they don’t have the authority to injure back.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Charity is interested in mitigating circumstances; in bits of the truth that can cast a less catastrophic light on our follies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but usually they stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in life as a whole, and especially in relationships, charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided: who is weak and who is powerful changes rapidly and frequently. You are likely to be, as it were, a patron in one area and a beggar in another. So we must be kind not only because we are touched by the suffering of others but because we properly understand that we too will soon be in urgent need of an equally vital dose of charity in some other part of life.</span></p>
