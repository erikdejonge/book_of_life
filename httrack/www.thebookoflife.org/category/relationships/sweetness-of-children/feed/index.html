				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For almost all of human history, it has been unthinkable that someone could lay claim to maturity, sanity and reliability by pinning a picture by a six-year-old to the walls of their office, or throne room. At least until the 20th century, the art that won prestige showed great command of technical skills and a sensitive fidelity to the real appearance of things.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2449" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennedy.jpg" alt="kennedy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Child’s art in the office: pioneer Bobby Kennedy, in the early 1960’s</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is it about children (reflected in their bold, vivid, and utterly distorted and wonky drawings) that we now see special merit in? We know casually that children – and their art – can be very sweet. But what is really going on beneath that word ‘sweetness’ and quite why do we seem to need this quality so much at this point in history?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The work below was done by Noah. He is five and three quarters and lives in Durham, England. His father, who is a regional manager for a supermarket chain, has it prominently in his cubicle at work. The art shows mum, dad, Noah and little brother James. It is raining, as it often does in that part of the world. But the mood is decisively upbeat. The artist seems broadly extremely optimistic about the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2450" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/childsdrawing.jpg" alt="childsdrawing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">More valuable than the Mona Lisa</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What often touches us in the art of children are a host of qualities that are deeply under threat in adult lives and yet which we unconsciously recognise as precious to a sense of inner balance and psychological well-being. The sweet is a vital part of ourselves – currently in exile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most recurring features of children’s art is evidence of trust. So long as things have gone reasonably well, children can believe in surfaces: if mummy smiles, she must be OK. There is, at a young age, blessedly little room for ambiguity. Children are not always trying to peer below the surface and discover the compromises and evasions that belong to maturity. Their art functions as a highly necessary corrective to cynicism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adult lives seldom allow us not to be wary and suspicious. We grow to expect trouble to come from any direction. We are aware of the fragility of things; and how easily safety and hope can be crushed. It is rare to have fifteen minutes without being submerged by a new wave of anxiety. It is therefore understandable if we turn with relief to the trusting attitude of those great diminutive artists, as brilliant at lifting our spirits as they are hopeless at delivering correct representations of an oak tree or a human face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Noah’s picture is full of hints as to what we deeply need. For a start, we need to be more willing to suppose that most other people are really quite nice. A touch of cynicism is – obviously – highly useful. It’s just that collectively we have talked ourselves into giving a cynical attitude too much prestige. It crowds out other things we require. And children’s drawings have become our contemporary way of smuggling them in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another endearing and psychologically necessary quality of children’s art is quite how inaccurate it tends to be. A traditional assumption of drawing is that being ‘good’ at it requires one to lay aside the demands of one’s own ego in order to pay precise attention to what is actually out there. The artist must learn how to observe the world, and in order to do so, must put a lot of themselves to one side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2452" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/childsdrawing3.jpg" alt="childsdrawing3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the child responsible for the scene above hasn’t tried to look objectively at a tree and work out just how a branch is attached to a trunk, or what precise shape a leaf is. Rather than being in any way painstaking or faithful, the child is gleefully unconcerned as to the true facts of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is sweet is this daring lack of interest in ‘getting it right’ which symbolises a delightful freedom from concern about whether others will think it right or not either. Again, the term sweetness is our way of acknowledging that this is something we need to do a little more of in our own lives, but find very hard to ask for directly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s totally understandable that we learn, as adults, to accommodate ourselves to the needs of reality and of other people. But we can devote ourselves to this goal with so much zeal, our souls dry up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This painstakingly beautiful drawing was done by the English 19th century artist and critic John Ruskin. Ruskin, like many artists, saw drawing as a process whereby we properly attend to the singularity of things out there in the world. He saw the great artist as a paragon of ‘unselfishness’, caring more about the proper appearance of a leaf than the demands of his or her own ego. He was keen that children learn to draw ‘properly’ from a young age (four was not too young in his eyes). He did not ascribe any value to their untutored, spontaneous ‘scribbles’. He was – in a sense – right, and at the same time, profoundly wrong…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2453" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ruskin2.jpg" alt="ruskin2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children are sometimes at their sweetest when they suggest schemes that adults know are utterly impractical. A five-year-old thinks it would be nice to have a career that combines being an astronaut with being chef for his mum; his sister plans to keep an elephant in the garden; a boy says he’d like to marry his elder brother, another that he wants to invent a machine that will allow him to reverse time. Rather than dismissing these as idiotic or impractical ideas, we are frequently enchanted when children talk, as they often do, with great earnestness about their plans to reform or improve on the conditions of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sweetness lies in the way their thoughts have not yet had to be tested by experience. They can still make utopian leaps, without censoring themselves. Our pleasure is a sign that we, the adults, have grown painfully short on this freedom ourselves. We find it poignant and touching to witness their ideas (a plan to make the biggest bridge in the world out of Lego or to invent an airplane that runs on water) because we realise that we have crushed this faculty of freedom a little too rigorously in ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2455" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mission_control_center-1.jpg" alt="Mission_control_center-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is not, in fact, strange that it is this period of human history that has been the first to get really interested in the sweetness of children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Societies get sensitive to things that they are missing. We live in a world of highly complex technology, extreme precision in science, massive bureaucracies, insecurity and intense meritocratic competition. To survive with any degree of success in these conditions, we have to be exceptionally controlled, forward-thinking, reasonable and cautious creatures. However, we tend not to identify what has grown in short supply in our lives head on. It would be rare to say: we need more flights of fancy, more innocent trust, more gleeful disregard of expectations… We have forgotten that this is what we even want. Instead, we simply find it moving – in fact sweet – to encounter these things in symbolic forms in the scribblings of a child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children’s art provides an opportunity to start to get to know our own needs. They are, in their own way, political demands, compact manifestos for some of the things we urgently need a little more of in the anxious, compromised conditions of contemporary adult life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2456" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/factory-juverston.jpg" alt="factory-juverston" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Against such a backdrop, children’s art is no longer just endearing, it is positively necessary</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Of course, we expect it to be the other way around: we teaching them. But they have a host of important lessons for us too, if we dare to pay close enough attention.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>1. We’re dependent creatures</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to play it tough now, to overdo our autonomy and independence. But to have survived, we all had to be recipients of continuous exhaustive ministration and attention, at all hours and in multiple ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies are a reminder that no one made themselves. And therefore, that we’re heavily in someone’s debt (and should – perhaps – call our mother).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4449" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project11.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. What love is</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As adults, we give love chiefly because of what others can do for us: entertain us, charm our eyes, explain things, soothe us…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies don’t deserve much of anything from this point of view. They can do nothing at all for us (there’s no ‘point’ to them, as slightly older children sometimes say), they have little to talk about and are asleep for a lot of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we help them nevertheless. They, in turn, teach us about the truest, purest, ego-free kind of love, which is about giving affection without an expectation of receiving anything in return, but simply because someone else needs help – and we are in a position to give it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/113087458_81cdbe12dc_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8884" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/113087458_81cdbe12dc_o.jpg?resize=550%2C607" alt="113087458_81cdbe12dc_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. People are usually tired and scared; not mean</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They can’t – of course – tell us what is wrong with them. We have to guess – and what’s striking is how generous we are in our interpretation of what is going on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they cry, we don’t accuse them of being mean or self-pitying. When they hit or kick, we assume they must just be frightened or momentarily vexed. We are constantly aware of just how much the workings of hunger, a tricky digestive tract or a lack of sleep may affect human character.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How helpful it would be if we were more often able to apply a similar method of interpretation around adults. How kind we would be if we could look beneath the surface behaviour – the unpleasantness, viciousness and desperate grumpiness – and see that what could really be going on is just confusion, fear and exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8767955537_4b053bafa8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8885" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8767955537_4b053bafa8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8767955537_4b053bafa8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. We have more in common than we think</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the simplest truth: we were all babies once. It’s an especially alien thought in the context of people we find weird or off-putting. The tramp, the maniac, the thief. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They all once started off in exactly the same place as us. However different we may all be now, we share a common heritage – and there is therefore always material to hand from which a sense of identification – and a measure of compassion – can arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. No one is that scary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Others may be impressive and frightening now, but they were all once tiny and fragile and retain some of that early vulnerability somewhere beneath their armour. It’s a basic levelling democratic thought, like the idea that everyone, even the very important, serious and wealthy, have to visit a bathroom every few hours.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19650368_ad5e5c496e_o-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8886" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19650368_ad5e5c496e_o-1.jpg?resize=550%2C606" alt="19650368_ad5e5c496e_o (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. There is hope</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to get sickened by our species: the greed, the status consciousness, the vanity…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we should hang out with babies as a corrective; they don’t care if the car is big, they don’t pay attention to what one’s job is or how much one’s making.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They care about the fundamentals: cuddles, laughter, friendship, being with people who are nice to them whatever they look like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deep down, we’re perhaps all like this. It’s society that corrupts us and encourages the wrong impulses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies are on the side of utopian politics. They argue that the world should be different from the way it is now. They’re messengers of hope. Each one is an example of how we might all be, if only our societies could be differently and better arranged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. They are artists</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They correct some of our disenchantment and boredom, for they are pleased by ostensibly ‘minor’ but important things. A cup with a peculiar sort of lid. A flower. A puddle. The sunlight on the carpet. The taste of milk. Things that have become boring to us – unfairly so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer, Renoir, Proust, Tolstoy all knew how to renew our enthusiasm for minor things. Babies are not so different, and deserve a little of the respect we naturally find ourselves giving great artists.</span></p>
