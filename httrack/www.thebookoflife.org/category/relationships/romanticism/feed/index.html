				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The strange thing about love is that even though we experience it in a deeply personal and apparently instinctive way, it has a history. In other words, people around the world haven’t always fallen in love the way they do now.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of rehearsing a few of the telling moments in love’s history is to remind ourselves that there are different ways of arranging relationships, depending on what a given society happens to believe in. Love is a cultural invention and we are not at the end of its evolution. We may, in fact, still be only at the early stages of the history of love. We are still learning what we need and how we might get more successful at love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Mari, Syria, 1775 BC</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mari-290x2901.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6629" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mari-290x2901.jpg?resize=450%2C450" alt="Mari-290x290" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">King Zimri-Lim of the ancient city of Mari, on the banks of the Euphrates, marries Shibtu, the princess of the neighbouring kingdom of Yamhad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being the outcome of love, this marriage, like that of many between powerful people in the ancient world, is purely transactional. Mari occupies a critical position in the trade routes between Syria and Mesopotamia, and marrying Shibtu will allow Zimri-Lim to expand his wealth and power.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zimri-Lim’s attitude to marriage continues with his children. He marries off eight of his daughters to rulers of neighbouring cities, forcing each of his new sons-in-law to sign a document pledging themselves to him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people of Mari are in effect saying that what gives a marriage meaning isn’t how much the couple happens to love one another, but whether it is beneficial in terms of trade, connections and war. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is so alien to us, it’s worth reflecting on just how much we nowadays refuse to entertain &#8211; at least in public &#8211; any practical considerations when marrying. Feelings are meant to be our only lodestars. Yet for thousands of years, until only a minute ago on the historical clock, it was unambiguously meant to be only about land, power and money. The notion that you should love your spouse would have seemed plain laughable. This may have created a collective trauma we’re still in flight from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Blaye, France, 1147</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jaufré Rudel, the Prince of Blaye, sets sail for Tripoli, in modern day northern Lebanon. He is off to see the Countess of Tripoli, with whom he has fallen deeply in love. Rudel is one of the earliest known Troubadours, or skilled court poets, who rise to prominence in southern France in the 12th century and write poetry on one subject exclusively: Love. Rudel has written many poems in honour of the Countess and wants to write some more in her presence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6650" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="DickseeRomeoandJuliet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Rudel’s idea of love is very particular and at that time, dramatically new: it’s love that’s utterly divorced from practical considerations, that doesn’t involve children, money, dynasties or even any kind of reciprocation. The Troubadour poets never try to have sex with the objects of their love. Their focus is exclusively on what we would call the infatuation &#8211; or more colloquially, the crush &#8211; side of love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rudel has fallen in love with the Countess without ever having set eyes on her. Pining away for his lady from hundreds of miles away, he composes and sets to music many songs expressing grief and joy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, he falls ill en route to the lady and has to be stretchered into Tripoli, where the countess hears about him and visits him in his chamber. Rudel recovers momentarily, before dying, finally at peace, very chastely, in her arms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jaufre_rudel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6634" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jaufre_rudel.jpg?resize=450%2C656" alt="Jaufre_rudel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Troubadours took love very seriously, only they didn’t see it as linked to marriage. Romantic love was something you felt for someone you were never going to do household chores with. And that may be the secret of its intensity. This kind of love was spared too much contact with daily life. Rudel could imagine how lovely the Countess of Tripoli was &#8211; without ever having to dispute with her about the right place to hang a tapestry or get frustrated if she didn’t particularly want to do a special embarrassing thing for him in bed. Their love could remain pristine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Troubadours show us a historical moment when the idea of love was not tied to the notion of moving in together or to the intertwining of two practical, economic and social lives (using the same toilet, sharing utilities bills and trying to go on camping holidays with your partner’s friends). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Versailles, France, 14 September 1745</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At 6 o’clock in the evening, in a move engineered and planned for weeks, Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, a 23-year-old beauty from Paris, rouged, powdered and wearing a black off-the-shoulder dress, enters the Cabinet du Conseil, approaches King Louis XV, and curtsies three times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This simple gesture makes it official: Jeanne-Antoinette is the king’s maîtresse déclarée, or chief mistress, and from now on, she will be known as Madame du Pompadour, and reside at court with the king.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6636" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The king has, by this point, been married for 20 years, but marriage doesn’t mean fidelity. You marry for reasons of state, and have mistresses on the side. No one gets upset, that’s just what happens. Louis XV had several mistresses, including 14-year-old Marie-Louise O’Murphy, who is painted in a famous semi-pornographic painting by François Boucher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6637" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Versailles in the 18th century, there was an acceptance of the imperfect fit between marriage and love. It was understood that there would always be a tension between the two. Marriage was for children, practicality and continuity. Love was for excitement, drama and sex. One should never try to blend the two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than be underhand or deceitful like many people are today, the king of France simply split love from marriage &#8211; and, without shame or guilt, made his romantic attachments an organised, public part of his life with his wife. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gretna Green, Scotland, 1 January 1812</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A couple has just got married in a secret ceremony. John Lambton, the 1st Earl of Durham, who is posh and has land and responsibilities, and Harriet, the illegitimate daughter of the Earl of Cholmondeley, who has no money and little social status but is very pretty, are now man and wife.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their families are furious &#8211; and have tried desperately to stop the wedding. But the couple are ‘modern’, which means they believe that in marriage, love should come first and practical considerations second. They’ve gone to Gretna Green, a village just inside Scotland, to escape English law &#8211; and are exemplars of the new philosophy of Romanticism, which privileges feeling over reason and impulse over tradition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/handfasting-wedding-traditions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6642" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/handfasting-wedding-traditions.jpg?resize=635%2C629" alt="handfasting-wedding-traditions" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romanticism transforms love. The old system of marrying for political or economic advantage slowly crumbles around the world. The village of Gretna Green becomes synonymous with illicit marriages, and John and Harriet are among hundreds of English couples in the late 18th and 19th centuries who elope there. The public appetite for stories of romantic dissent is such that the local priest publishes some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>bestselling memoirs of his time there, full of daring coach-rides across the border, and the wrath of unconsulted fathers who reach the runaway children too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gretna Green becomes an important place because there is a growing belief that marriage should be the consequence of love. And that if two people love each other that alone is what matters. Income, the standing of the wider family, career and how the parents-in-law might get on seems irrelevant. And more than that: they begin to be cast not as wise, serious matters which really ought to be taken into account, but as things that could only seem relevant to gouty fathers, snobbish aunts and dried up conventional people with no care for the happiness of a couple. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mostly, when we want to do something we take advice if we can from people who have done it before. Gretna Green stands for a remarkable shift in thinking, around relationships, which is powerful today: the assumption that people who have already had marriages are likely to be very poor advisors and guides to the young. Love is understood to be an enthusiasm, not a skill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">London, England, 1813</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Readers of Jane Austen’s latest novel are on the edge of their seats as Fitzwilliam Darcy stumbles his way through a proposal to Elizabeth Bennet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His offer of marriage promises to fix all her problems: not only is he handsome, but he is rich – and Elizabeth’s family, with four unmarried daughters to support, needs all the cash they can get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Elizabeth says no. Darcy, for all his gifts, is also arrogant and a snob. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> may suggest women marry for money, but Elizabeth’s actions reveal a new and subversive belief rapidly gaining currency in English society: that they should love the man they marry too. It is an idea Austen supports strongly. Eleven years earlier, she had herself rejected a proposal of marriage, claiming “anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without affection”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/779px-Thomson-PP14-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6644" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/779px-Thomson-PP14-1.jpg?resize=635%2C599" alt="779px-Thomson-PP14 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her greatest novel, however, things turn out for the best. Eventually, after many twists and turns, and despite her lack of standing and money, Elizabeth and Darcy marry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What continues to strike readers today is that Jane Austen is deeply concerned about romance and about money. To marry only for money is, she argues, a disaster. But equally she holds that to marry only for love is terrible folly too. In her eyes a good marriage requires warmth and tenderness of heart and a strong practical, worldly, managerial competence. And from this, she draws the conclusion that few people are actually well-suited for marriage. She is unsurprised that many marriages are a little hollow or a little grim. Her novels depict numerous unsatisfactory relationships and a very few happy ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early years of the 19th century, Jane Austen is defining the wise ideal of modern love. She sees marriage as a hybrid enterprise: in some respects it is like running a small business, or organising a village fete. If you don’t keep track of the practical details and don’t have quite an efficient turn for administration, things will go badly wrong. But at the same time, marriage is a profoundly complex emotional encounter. And to thrive in it one needs emotional maturity, affection, playfulness and warmth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through her novels she is trying to present the reader with an education. In a truly classical way, she believes we can do few things well if we leave our performance to nature, luck and chance. A happy relationship depends on the maturity of both parties. In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, both Elizabeth Bennet<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Darcy have to be improved &#8211; he has to lose his pride and she has to shed her prejudice &#8211; if they are to be capable of living well together. Love is something we need to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">London 24 November 1859 </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the day Darwin publishes<em> The Origin of Species</em>. There is a huge initial resistance. But eventually much of the world is convinced by his arguments. Human beings are descended from the primates. And that means that we have inherited not just their skeletal structure but also a lot of their drives and basic psychology. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_1871.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6638" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_1871.jpg?resize=635%2C629" alt="669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_(1871)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Darwin’s detractors are aghast at the implied humiliation. But there’s consolation in Darwin too, because he suggests that our inability to live up to our ideals is not wholly our own fault. We are, at any time, half apes. And for apes to aim for faithful, life-long, passionate, egalitarian relationships is to attempt to pull off something hugely difficult starting from a very unpromising base. No wonder we often fail.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6639" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.png?resize=635%2C559" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without particularly intending to, Darwin ushers in a strategic and useful pessimism about relationships. Rather than being, for instance, essentially monogamous, he implies that human beings might &#8211; by nature at least &#8211; be predisposed to (as many apes are) to polygamy, opportunistic sex and the dumping of one mate for another on the basis of nothing more than their breeding potential, signalled by such unedifying and unspiritual characteristics as how big their breasts are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Aquatic Park, San Francisco, United States, August 1965</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jefferson Poland, wearing a flower behind his ear, strips off his swimming trunks and wades naked into the sea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poland is one of the first hippies. He wears his hair long and rejects the sophistication of modern life for a romantic notion of getting back to a natural state of grace. Behind him and three other protesters braving the icy cold ocean water is a cheering crowd of beatniks and anarchists, who hold up signs and chant the phrase “Sex is clean! Law is obscene!” in front of a hastily assembled group of reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flower_Power_demonstrator.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6655" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flower_Power_demonstrator.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="Flower_Power_demonstrator" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This event is one of many organised by groups advocating free love in the 1960s in America. They argue that society’s rules against nudity, same-sex relationships and sex before marriage are all forms of sexual repression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Soon monogamy itself is being questioned; in an enlightened world, they argue, sexually liberated men and women should give up marriage, along with it, jealousy, adultery and divorce. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a beautiful, deeply Romantic idea of what love could be &#8211; which eventually collapses into disaster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Belgium, 2015</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The country achieves a notorious distinction. It is the nation with the highest rate of divorce in the developed world, an astonishing 71% of couples split up. A newspaper in the country asks why, and the answer comes back clearly: initial expectations were not met.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6648" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other countries are not far behind. In the UK, the divorce rate is 42%, in the US, 53%, in Hungary 67% and in Portugal 68%.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason lies in the disappointment people feel with what had apparently been promised to them by the free-loving 1960s, and before that, by 19th-century Romanticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream of love survives, but it disappoints constantly. At dinner tables around the world, otherwise intelligent people complain that they simply cannot understand the strange and tricky subject of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The future hope for love lies in the notion of sacrifice: that is, in accepting that we won’t get everything we want from love, relationships or marriage. We’re trying to do something highly ambitious in our modern ideals of relationships: unite sex, affection, the raising of a family, a career and adequate material security. We will, by necessity, fail to get all of these.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/728px-1491_Henry_VIII.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6647" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/728px-1491_Henry_VIII.jpg?resize=635%2C585" alt="728px-1491_Henry_VIII" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of sacrifice, though, helps us if we consider that getting half of what we really want and need might still be quite a lot &#8211; in comparison with what it would be like if we avoided relationships altogether. Clearly a solitary life can work really well for a few people, but mostly we hate living alone. The question should not be so much whether relationships live up to our ideal hopes of mutual happiness but whether they are better (if only a little) than not having relationships at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The future of love needs us to get interested in ambivalence: that is, in the capacity to keep on thinking that something is quite good even while we are painfully conscious of its many and striking day-to-day imperfections.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It sounds paradoxical to talk of the<em> problems</em> of being beautiful, when we’re so alive to all the advantages that go with possessing sculpted cheekbones, copious amounts of hair, an ideal nose, long, slender legs and well-moulded ankles.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the subject is necessary and legitimate, because beauty is not in fact problem-free. There are a range of ailments (too little discussed) that go with being extremely beautiful. Here are seven of the greatest:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: You are boring </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not absolutely always, of course. No one is. But the temptation to be boring is great – and it’s not your fault at all. It’s just that, since you were 12, there has always been a party that people were begging you to go to. You’ve almost never had to begin a conversation. Others have always been on hand to entertain you. You’ve not had much chance just to be on your own, with nothing much to do other than fall back on an exploration of your own psyche. You’ve never known the fruitful ravages of self-hatred. There has been no need to charm others with words – and no pressure to overcome their scepticism with humour or acute observations. Indeed, you’ve often wanted to put people off. Being a bit boring has in fact been a survival strategy. It is the only way to stop people pestering you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451570210.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5860" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451570210.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="The Serpentine Gallery Summer Party - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: You intimidate the ugly </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not deliberately at all. In fact, it’s horrible to discover that really nice people who don’t look very nice (the majority of humanity) are terrified of approaching you. It’s a weird thing to find you have this effect. You’d really like that quiet person in the corner to dare to come and say hi: they’re kind, good natured and (when they finally relax) very funny – but they know they look a bit of a frump and don’t want to be reminded of the fact by standing near you. In a different life you could be great friends, even lovers. Just not in this one. They freeze when they catch sight of your radiant eyes, perfect profile and incredibly elegant hands. Even if it’s not quite what you want, the people it’s easiest to pair up with are other beautiful types. No wonder your relationships can be very dull indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4944696111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5865" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4944696111.jpg?resize=635%2C494" alt="RCA Graduate Fashion Show Gala Reception" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: You miss out on some usefully difficult experiences</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone would be thrilled to be your lover. You’ve not been single for longer than a few months ever. In your adult life, you’ve not faced rejection in any serious way. Who could ever take their leave? Yet, weirdly, it’s often through difficult experiences that we grow to maturity. They’re painful, but necessary. They force us to develop compensating resources: we become stronger, more resilient; we learn compassion; we get more appreciative of small things. It’s not your fault, but you’ve been a little spoilt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451546188.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5858" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451546188.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="Johnnie Walker Blue Label Announces Collaboration With Jude Law With Stills From 'The Gentleman's Wager' Film" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Relationships are more difficult </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In bed, you’re always wondering: ‘is it me or is it my body they want?’ You want to be loved for the whole of who you are. But your exterior is so fantastic, it overshadows anything else; people just can’t ignore it. You want to be appreciated for your take on the French novel, your loyalty to your troubled sister, your views on the future of the left. But even when people say the right things, the fears won’t go away. They make too much sense.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4886844451.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5866" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4886844451.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="&quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; Press Conference" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: People assume you are stupid</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They don’t wait to find out. Their imaginations simply refuse to picture you carefully unpicking a page of Hegel or analysing the state of the Swedish economy. They like the idea of you being a bit dim. There seems to be a prejudice against combining outstanding qualities: you just can’t be that beautiful and understand nuclear physics. That would be too much good fortune ending up in the one place. Everyone insists you can’t be very intelligent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154538116.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5856" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154538116.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Robert Pattinson Sydney Photocall" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: No one imagines you have any problems</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortune – people feel – has smiled on you already. You can’t need anything. Your are a magnet for envy: a fair few people<em> like</em> finding fault with you. They feel that you need to be shown you are nothing special (though you never claimed to be). They are using you to vent their frustrations with life in general. You’re fair game – you are too beautiful, they think, ever to be hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_1415640301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5850" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_1415640301.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Sean Connery, In The Role Of James Bond, Receives A Massage From Jeanne Roland In 'You Only Live Twice'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Ageing is worse</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have this rare thing: your body is ideal. <em>For now</em>. That’s why getting older terrifies you a lot. (Yesterday you found another wrinkle. Your left knee twinges when you climb the stairs). You have so much to lose. You’ll look in the mirror and foresee a wreck. From being so high, the fall will be harder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_71495575.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5862" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_71495575.jpg?resize=635%2C541" alt="Joan Collins" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, the problems of the very beautiful are transient. Thankfully, no one stays long at the peak of loveliness. Time will take your troubles away. In a few years, almost certainly, your looks will have lost their uncanny perfection; your physique will shed its grace. You will be nice enough looking, but you will no longer be one of the outstandingly attractive ones – and you will no longer share in their unique, but very real and very under-appreciated, problems. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Match.com is one of the world’s leading dating sites. Officially it is all in favour of people getting married. It eagerly relates stories of how members got together and stayed together. In fact it presents itself as a place where you should go if you hope to get into a long-term relationship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2143" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-matchA.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet match.com is actually the enemy of long-term relationships and marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2144" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-matchB-1.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many obstacles to being married. And getting together with someone is only the first – and in many ways the least challenging – of these hurdles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Match.com is devoted to the task of helping us find the ‘right’ person, which, in its view, means someone who shares our tastes, interests and general attitudes to life. Match.com subscribes to the compatibility idea of relationships, which notes that we tend to get on best with people who share our interests. This might be true in the short term. But, over an extended period of time, the relevance of this fades dramatically. Indeed, the person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our tastes, but someone who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently and wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4344" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchC.jpg?resize=635%2C675" alt="Married couple holding hands in front of painting in art gallery" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for compatibility is dangerous because it has a tendency to escalate absurdly. Two people who like reading and sport might fall out terribly because one is obsessed with crime fiction, while the other is always wanting to talk about archaeology. One wants to go to the hockey match but the other is obsessed with canoeing. So the temptation is to refine the search. But this leads to astonishing levels of detail. One ends up searching for a partner who is keen on fly-fishing and the novels of John le Carrè, who loves going camping in North Cornwall in September and who is sympathetic to the Liberal Party (but also an enthusiast of tactical voting). But, of course, two such people could easily come to blows over the colour of the bedroom curtains, children’s names, the use of napkins, or the ethics of fracking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4345" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchD.jpg?resize=635%2C709" alt="VARIOUS - 2002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people actually are together long-term, what they have to deal with are all the things that they don’t like about the other person and don’t share. That is the real challenge of relationships and yet it is one that is implicitly denied by Match.com, which emphasises precisely the opposite: ‘compatibility’ as the key to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The danger is that when lovers do get together, the moment they hit a hurdle, if they sense they are ‘incompatible’, they will panic. If their tastes in coffee or child rearing differ, then they had best split up – surely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than asking us ever more refined questions about our tastes in order to align them, Match.com should investigate what people are like when things end up mismatched, as they inevitably do in real relationships: when our lovers surprise us by not agreeing with us, when there is a need to back down, when one isn’t going to get all one wants. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate difference that’s the true marker of the ‘right’ person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1707" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/114450365.jpg" alt="CZECH AND SLOVAK REPUBLIC OUT --- CZECH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You try to set aside a special evening every now and then. That would have been absurd in the old days, you were alone so much of the time, but now there’s a need to make it artificial and schedule it in the diary way ahead of time. Which means – sadly – the pressure is greater.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it feels rather strange to be out, just the two of you. It can be hard to know how to get started. Obviously there are so many vital things you need to say to one another, but they can be elusive. You look carefully at the design of the wine glass. It seems to be Scandinavian. You mention that the colour of the menu is unusual. Your partner comments that it looked like it was going to be difficult parking – which, it turns out, it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to have a ‘Romantic’ conception of conversation. We believe that in the right setting – distressed old wooden tables, food from Liguria, bruschetta – conversation will flow naturally, without special effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reality is that conversation is an achievement, something we might need to learn. This point belongs to a bigger argument about emotional education. We do not spontaneously or naturally possess many of the skills we need in order to cope adequately with the demands of psychological life. There is much we should learn about love, work, ageing, family life, self-control, but on the whole modern societies have not provided education of this kind, or even seen it as desirable. They have unconsciously been guided by the likes of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who thought of artifice (rules we learn around emotional functioning) as fundamental obstacles to real intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1708" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/159827991.jpg" alt="Portrait of Jean-Jacques Rousseau" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Not keen on rules about how to talk to your lover</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we should not feel that we are a failure, dull-witted, unimaginative or unsophisticated if we recognise a theoretical need to learn how to talk to our partners with premeditation and conscious purpose. We are simply emerging from a Romantic prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1709" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2372729e.jpg" alt="BEFORE MIDNIGHT - Jan 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, therefore, is an attempt at a conversational menu, questions to raise as the meal unfolds, and designed to unlock certain chambers of our hearts:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you most like to be complimented on in the relationship? Where do you think you’re especially good as a person?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which of your flaws do you want to be treated more generously?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the start of a relationship, there’s an exciting period when you are getting to know one another. One evening you hear all about the partner’s cousin – whose existence you hadn’t even suspected. Another time they tell you of their French holidays during adolescence. Then things settle down. You come to feel you know each other through and through. Yet this is necessarily always simply a failure of imagination. Every life is inexhaustibly interesting. Here are some follow-on suggestions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you tell your younger self about love?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What do I get wrong about you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is one incident you would like to apologise to me for?  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is one incident you would like me to apologise to you for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s perhaps time for the main course now, a chance to deepen matters further:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finish the following sentences:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I am anxious in our relationship, I tend to….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You then tend to respond by….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which makes me…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we argue, on the surface I show ……, but inside I feel….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more I ….., the more you….. and then the more I….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I was magically offered a chance to change something about you, what do you guess it would be?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you want to change about me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How have I let you down?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without thinking too hard, let’s finish these sentence stems about our feelings towards one another:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I resent…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am puzzled by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am hurt by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I regret…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am afraid that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am frustrated by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am happier when…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciate…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hope…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would so like you to understand…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s getting late. A chance to try out a few final enquiries:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you could write an instruction manual for yourself in bed, what would you put in it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both take a piece of paper and write down three new things you would like to try around sex. Exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships founder on our inability to make ourselves known and forgiven for who we are. We shouldn’t work with the assumption that if we have a row over these questions, the evening has been wasted. We need to be able to say certain painful things in order to recover an ability to be affectionate and trusting. That is all part of the particular wisdom and task of a more structured and emotionally-conscious date night.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It sounds strange to ask what a novel might be for. We tend not to wonder too much what role made-up stories should have in our lives. Generally we suppose we just read them for entertainment.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8867" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet that is to be unstrategic about a major cultural resource. A novel is a machine for simulating experience, a ‘life simulator’ and – like its flight equivalent – it allows us safely to experience what it might – in real life – take us years and great danger to go through. Unaided, we are puny in our powers of empathy and comprehension, isolated from the inner lives of others, limited in our experiences, short of time, and able to encounter only a tiny portion of the world first hand. Fiction extends our range – it takes us inside the intimate consciousness of strangers, it lets us sit in on experiences that would be terrifying or reckless in reality; it lends us more lives than we have been given.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three ways in particular in which novels deliver their assistance:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As cautionary tales:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They give us early warnings. They alert us to dangers that we’re not adept at recognising: where envy might lead us, what indifference can do to a relationship, where lust can drive us… They trace the links between apparently minor errors of personality and the monumental catastrophes they can unleash, in the hope that by showing us the pitfalls, our own tendencies to disaster and folly may be curbed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As maps of progress:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fiction provides models of development, demonstrations of triumph over difficulties, case studies in maturation and the acquisition of wisdom. We are carefully taken through ways in which certain people have learned, perhaps over many years and with much pain, how to cope with problems which are, in some ways, also our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As exhortations:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many good things which we may have not known close-up but which we would benefit from experiencing – and which fiction can create for us. It can show us a couple who have understood how to resolve their difficulties with grace and humour, a father who can be at once authoritative and kind; a politician who has overcome vanity and tribal interests. It’s not simply that we need to know there are such people at large. It’s that by spending time in their company, the more admirable sides of human nature have an opportunity to rub off on us a little.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-666" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blue.jpg" alt="Blue is the Warmest Colour - 22 Aug 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, there are too many bad novels out there – by which one means, novels that do not give us a correct map of love, that leave us unprepared to deal adequately with the difficulties of being in a couple. In moments of acute distress in relationships, our grief is too often complicated by a sense that things have become, for us alone, unusually and perversely difficult. Not only are we suffering, but it seems that our suffering has no equivalent in the lives of other more or less sane people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our attitudes to our own love lives are in large part formed by the tradition of the Romantic novel (which nowadays is advanced not only in literary fiction but in video, music and advertising). The narrative arts of the Romantic novel have unwittingly constructed a devilish template of expectations of what relationships are supposed to be like – in the light of which our own love lives often look grievously and deeply unsatisfying. We break up or feel ourselves cursed in significant part because we are exposed to the wrong works of literature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If this ‘wrong’ kind is to be termed Romantic, then the right kind – of which there are so few – might be deemed Classical. Here are some of the differences:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE PLOT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> In the archetypal Romantic novel, the drama hinges entirely on how a couple get together: the ‘love story’ is no such thing, it is merely the account of how love begins. All sorts of obstacles are placed in the way of love’s birth, and the interest lies in watching their steady overcoming: there might be misunderstandings, bad luck, prejudice, war, a rival, a fear of intimacy, or – most poignantly – shyness… But in the end, after tribulations, the right people will eventually get into couples. Love begins – and the story must end.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> This wiser, less immediately seductive genre knows that the real problem isn’t finding a partner, it is tolerating them, and being tolerated, over time. It knows that the start of relationships is not the high point that Romantic culture assumes; it is merely the first step of a far longer, more ambivalent and yet quietly far more heroic journey – on which it directs its intelligence and scrutiny.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sofa.jpg" alt="Weekend - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">WORK</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> The characters may have jobs but on the whole they have little impact on their psyches. Work goes on somewhere else. What one does for a living is not thought relevant to an understanding of love.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-668" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beautifullaunderette.jpg" alt="'My Beautiful Launderette' Film - 1985" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> But here we see that work is in fact a huge part of life, with an overwhelming role in shaping our relationships. Whatever our emotional dispositions, it is the stress of work that ends up generating a sizeable share of the trouble lovers will have with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CHILDREN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> Children are incidental, sweet symbols of mutual love, or naughty in an endearing way. They rarely cry, take up little time and are generally wise, exhibiting a native, unschooled intelligence.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-1.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> We see that relationships are fundamentally oriented towards the having and raising of children – and at the same time, that children place the couple under unbearable strains. They kill the passion that made them possible. Life moves from the sublime to the quotidian. There are toys in the living room, pieces of chicken under the table, and no time to talk. Everyone is always tired. This too is love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">PRACTICALITIES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> In this genre, we have only a hazy idea of who does the housework. It is not seen as relevant to a relationship. Domesticity is a corrupting force and people who care a lot about it are likely to be unhappy in their relationships. We are unlikely to learn a great deal concerning a couple’s thinking on homework or television for the under fours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/315659445_23870cf7ec_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8868" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/315659445_23870cf7ec_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="315659445_23870cf7ec_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> Here relationships are understood to be institutions, not just emotions. Part of their rationale is to enable two people to function as a joint economic unit for the education of the next generation. This is in no way banal. There are opportunities for genuine heroism. Especially around laundry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SEX</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> Sex and love are shown to belong together. The high point of love is intercourse. Adultery, in the romantic view, is therefore fatal: if you were with the right person you could never be unfaithful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> It knows that long-term love may not set up the best preconditions for sex. The classical attitude sees love and sex as distinct and at times divergent themes in life. And therefore sexual problems do not in themselves indicate that a relationship is, overall, a disaster…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">COMPATIBILITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> The Romantic novel cares about the harmony (or lack of it) between the souls of the protagonists. It believes that the fundamental challenge of romantic life is to find someone who completely understands us and with whom there need never be any more secrets. It believes that love is finding your other half, your spiritual twin. Love is not about training or education, it is an instinct, a feeling – and is generally mysterious in its workings.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marriage.jpg" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> It accepts that no one ever fully understands anyone else; that there must be secrets, that there will be loneliness, that there must be compromise. It believes that we have to learn how to sustain good relationships, that there are learnable skills, and that love is not just a chance endowment of nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic novel is deeply unhelpful. We have learned to judge ourselves by the hopes and expectations fostered by a misleading medium. By its standards, our own relationships are almost all damaged and unsatisfactory. No wonder separation or divorce so often appear to be inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They shouldn’t be, we merely need to change our reading matter: to tell ourselves more accurate stories about the progress of relationships, stories that normalise troubles and show us an intelligent, helpful path through them.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4349" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are introduced to someone at a conference. They look nice and you have a brief chat about the theme of the keynote speaker. But already, partly because of the slope of their neck and a lilt in their accent, you have reached an overwhelming conclusion. Or, you sit down in the carriage – and there, diagonally opposite you – is someone you cannot stop looking at for the rest of a journey across miles of darkening countryside. You know nothing concrete about them. You are going only by what their appearance suggests. You note that they have slipped a finger into a book (<i>The Food of the Middle East</i>), that their nails are bitten raw, that they have a thin leather strap around their left wrist and that they are squinting a touch short-sightedly at the map above the door. And that is enough to convince you. Another day, coming out of the supermarket, amidst a throng of people, you catch sight of a face for no longer than eight seconds and yet here too, you feel the same overwhelming certainty – and, subsequently, a bittersweet sadness at their disappearance in the anonymous crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Crushes: they happen to some people often and to almost everyone sometimes. Airports, trains, streets, conferences – the dynamics of modern life are forever throwing us into fleeting contact with strangers, from amongst whom we pick out a few examples who seem to us not merely interesting, but more powerfully, the solution to our lives. This phenomenon – the crush – goes to the heart of the modern understanding of love. It could seem like a small incident, essentially comic and occasionally farcical. It may look like a minor planet in the constellation of love, but it is in fact the underlying secret central sun around which our notions of the romantic revolve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1659" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lee-Friedlander-Revolving-Door-1963.jpg" alt="Lee-Friedlander-Revolving-Door-1963" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crush represents in pure and perfect form the dynamics of romantic philosophy: the explosive interaction of limited knowledge, outward obstacles to further discovery – and boundless hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The crush reveals how willing we are to allow details to suggest a whole. We allow the arch of someone’s eyebrow to suggest a personality. We take the way a person puts more weight on their right leg as they stand listening to a colleague as an indication of a witty independence of mind. Or their way of lowering their head seems proof of a complex shyness and sensitivity. From a few cues only, you anticipate years of happiness, buoyed by profound mutual sympathy. They will fully grasp that you love your mother even though you don’t get on well with her; that you are hard-working, even though you appear to be distracted; that you are hurt rather than angry. The parts of your character that confuse and puzzle others will at last find a soothing, wise, complex soulmate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1660" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_437872c.jpg" alt="BEFORE SUNRISE FILM STILLS 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The answer to life</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In elaborating a whole personality from a few small – but hugely evocative – details, we are doing for the inner character of a person what our eyes naturally do with the sketch of a face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4352" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_1951" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t see this as a picture of someone who has no nostrils, eight strands of hair and no eyelashes. Without even noticing that we are doing it, we fill in the missing parts. Our brains are primed to take tiny visual hints and construct entire figures from them – and we do the same when it comes to character. We are – much more than we give ourselves credit for – inveterate artists of elaboration. We have evolved to be ready to make quick decisions about people (to trust or withhold, to fight or embrace, to share or deny) on the basis of very limited evidence – the way someone looks at us, how they stand, a twitch of the lips, a slight movement of the shoulder – and we bring this ingenious but fateful talent to situations of love as much to those of danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cynical voice wants to declare that these enthusiastic imaginings at the conference or on the train, in the street or in the supermarket, are just delusional; that we simply project a false, completely imaginary idea of identity onto an innocent stranger. But this is too sweeping. We may be right. The wry posture may really belong to someone with a great line in scepticism; the head tilter may be unusually generous to the foibles of others. The error of the crush is more subtle, it lies in how easily we move from spotting a range of genuinely fine traits of character to settling on a recklessly naive romantic conclusion: that the other across the train aisle or pavement constitutes a complete answer to our inner needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1662" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meyerowitz_ny.jpg" alt="meyerowitz_ny" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary error of the crush lies in overlooking a central fact about people in general, not merely this or that example, but the species as a whole: <b>that everyone has something very substantially wrong with them</b> once their characters are fully known, something so wrong as to make an eventual mockery of the unlimited rapture unleashed by the crush. We can’t yet know what the problems will be, but we can and should be certain that they are there, lurking somewhere behind the facade, waiting for time to unfurl them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How can one be so sure? Because the facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. There is too much to fear: mortality, loss, dependency, abandonment, ruin, humiliation, subjection. We are, all of us, desperately fragile, ill-equipped to meet with the challenges to our mental integrity: we lack courage, preparation, confidence, intelligence. We don’t have the right role models, we were (necessarily) imperfectly parented, we fight rather than explain, we nag rather than teach, we fret instead of analysing our worries, we have a precarious sense of security, we can’t understand either ourselves or others well enough, we don’t have an appetite for the truth and suffer a fatal weakness for flattering denials. The chances of a perfectly good human emerging from the perilous facts of life are non-existent. Our fears and our frailties play themselves out in a thousand ways, they can make us defensive or aggressive, grandiose or hesitant, clingy or avoidant – but we can be sure that they will make everyone much less than perfect and at moments, extremely hard to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t have to know someone in any way before knowing this about them. Naturally, their particular way of being flawed (very annoying) will not be visually apparent and may be concealed for quite long periods. If we only encounter another person in a fairly limited range of situations (a train journey, rather than when they are trying to get a toddler into a car seat; a conference, rather than 87 minutes into a shopping trip with their elderly father) we may, for a very long time indeed (especially if we are left alone to convert our enthusiasm into an obsession because they don’t call us back or are playing it cool), have the pleasure of believing we have landed upon an angel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1663" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/154073361.jpg" alt="Claudia Cardinale in the street" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>A mature person thinks, not, ‘There’s nothing good here’, but rather ‘The genuinely good things will – inevitably – come mixed up with really terrible things’</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maturity doesn’t suggest we give up on crushes. Merely that we definitively give up on the founding romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of relationships and marriage has been based for the past 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can solve all our needs and satisfy our yearnings. We need to swap the Romantic view for the Tragic Awareness of Love, which states that every human can be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us – and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. This is a truth chiselled indelibly into the script of life. Choosing who to marry or commit ourselves to is therefore merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for, rather than an occasion miraculously to escape from grief.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should enjoy our crushes. A crush teaches us about qualities we admire and need to have more of in our lives. The person on the train really does have an extremely beguiling air of self-deprecation in their eyes. The person glimpsed by the fresh fruit counter really does promise to be a gentle and excellent parent. But these characters will, just as importantly, also be sure to ruin our lives in key ways, as all those we love will.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A caustic view of crushes shouldn’t depress us, merely relieve the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon long-term relationships. The failure of one particular partner to be the ideal Other is not – we should always understand – an argument against<i> them</i>; it is by no means a sign that the relationship deserves to fail or be upgraded. We have all necessarily, without being damned, ended up with that figure of our nightmares, ‘the wrong person.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic pessimism simply takes it for granted that one person should not be asked to be everything to another. With this truth accepted, we can look for ways to accommodate ourselves as gently and as kindly as we can to the awkward realities of life beside another fallen creature, for example, never feeling that we have to spend all of our time with them, being prepared for the disappointments of erotic life, not insisting on complete transparency, being ready to be maddened and to madden, making sure we are allowed to keep a vibrant independent social life and maintaining a clear-eyed refusal to act on sudden desires to run off with strangers on trains… A mature understanding of the madness of crushes turns out to be the best and perhaps the only solution to the tensions of long-term love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We are – each one of us – probably more one than the other. The categories explain a lot about us; how we approach nature, what makes us laugh, our attitudes to love, what our politics are… We may not be used to conceiving ourselves in these terms, but the labels Romantic and Classical usefully bring into focus some of the central themes of our personalities and help us to gain a clearer hold on the underlying structure of our enthusiasms and concerns.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What follows are a few of the central contrasting characteristics of Romantic and Classical personalities:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Intuition vs. Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics relish things that seem slightly to defy rational explanations. They are enthusiastic about feelings and wary of the intellect as a guide to life. They believe one shouldn’t always think too much. In their eyes, it may be slightly unfair to probe a decision or a mood too hard; they like instinct.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2314" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/176451971.jpg" alt="MYANMAR-ASTRONOMY-METEOR-SHOWER-PERSEIDS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In particular, they think one shouldn’t always attempt to take apart emotions as they relate to love, to the more spiritual varieties of experiences and to art and literature. They have (in appropriate contexts) a deep respect for unclear language and obscure modes of expression, which seem to them to hint at valuable yet ineffable aspects of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Classicists, on the other hand, are wary of intuition. They tend to have learnt, often through bitter experience, how misguided and deluded their own feelings may be and hence look rather sceptically and caustically upon them. They see no conflict between loving art and taking it apart and asking what it should be for. They favour clear modes of expression (even about rare and evanescent emotions, like those one might have looking at the stars) and like language that an intelligent 12-year-old could understand.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2315" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase64aa8cbe482f11ad6d.png" alt="pngbase64aa8cbe482f11ad6d" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2.  Spontaneity vs. Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics have often been wary of teaching and instruction. They think that important and serious activities should be spontaneous rather than taught. The idea that people might need to think rationally and exhaustively about what career to choose for themselves or whom they should marry strikes the Romantic as a misguided intrusion of education into things which should be spontaneous and natural (they like the notion of a ‘calling’ and of ‘love at first sight’).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2316" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/57210933.jpg" alt="Pillow fight" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of Romantics’ respect for spontaneity leads them to look with particular interest at children, who seem to them to have more direct access to the kind of truths and sensibilities that adults have lost. To the Romantic, it will always be a child who points out that the emperor is wearing no clothes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those of a Classical temperament don’t necessarily respect the current education system as we know it, but the abstract idea of education seems to them very important. They believe that training is vital if we are to avoid making too many mistakes in our emotional or professional lives. The Classically minded person sees education as perfectly placed to make good the shortfalls of our wayward natures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2317" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/102580313.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY SOFIA MISELEM A" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Honesty vs. Politeness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic person is devoted to saying what they think or feel. They are allergic to the idea of being fake or of having secrets. Authenticity is vital. They imagine politeness as a very dull lid that suppresses what really matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us. They believe deeply in getting on around other people. It is not that they are afraid of ruffling anyone’s feathers per se – but they just doubt whether it is ever really a constructive move and they are not interested in merely symbolic victories. They would prefer to have civil relations with someone rather than tell them frankly what is on their mind. They’re alive to how difficult it is for us to take on board challenging information from someone else. They accept an important role for secrets and white lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Idealism vs. Realism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be, and judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative. Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment and anger as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises, and timidity of the powerful. They are often furious with governments and surprised and outraged by evidence of venal and self-interested conduct in society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2320" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/129451067.jpg" alt="Demonstrators Continue To Occupy London's Financial District In A Protest Against City Greed" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For their part, the Classical person pays special attention to what can go wrong. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning a government, they consider the standard of governments across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances… Their view of people is fundamentally rather dark. They believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem. They feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses, lusts and drives, and take it for granted when bad behaviour manifests itself. They simply feel this is what humans are prone to. High ideals make them nervous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Earnestness vs. Irony</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics don’t believe in how things are. Their attention is fixed on how they should be. They therefore resist the deflationary call of ironic humour, which seems defeatist. They are earnest in their search for a better future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1292177721.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4354" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1292177721.jpg?resize=635%2C474" alt="Hillary Clinton Gives Foreign Policy Economics Address In New York" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical conviction is not that the world is a cheerful place, far from it; but rather that a cheerful mood is good starting point for living in a radically imperfect and deeply unsatisfactory realm – where the priority is not to give up, despair and kill oneself. Ironic humour is a standard recourse for them, because it emerges from the constant collision between how one would want things to be – and how it seems they in fact are. They like a bit of gallows humour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2322" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1388438j.jpg" alt="Curb Your Enthusiasm - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. The Rare vs. The Everyday</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic rebels against the ordinary. They are keen on the exotic and the rare. They like things which the mass of the population won’t yet know about. The fact that something is popular will always be a mark against it. Nor do they much like routine, especially in domestic life. They are anxious about higher things being put under pressure to become ‘useful’ or commercial. They want heroism, excitement and an end to boredom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4293" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg?resize=635%2C547" alt="Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical personality welcomes routine as a defence against chaos. They would very much like good things to be popular. They don’t necessarily think that what is popular is good; though they see popularity as, in principle, a mark of virtue. They are familiar enough with extremes as to welcome things that are a little boring. They can see the charm of doing the laundry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4355" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Purity vs. Ambivalence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic is drawn to either whole-hearted endorsement or total rejection. Ideally partners should love everything about each other. A political party should be admirable at every turn. A philanthropist should draw no personal benefit from acts of charity. The Romantic is dismayed by compromise. They feel the attraction of the lost cause. It is very important for the Romantic to feel they are right; winning is – by comparison – not such an urgent matter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4356" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical person takes the view that very few things, and no people, are either wholly good or entirely bad. They assume that there is likely to be some worth in opposing ideas and something to be learned from both sides. It is Classical to think that a decent person might in many areas hold views you find deeply unpalatable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time now, perhaps since around 1750, Romantic attitudes have been dominant in the Western imagination. The prevailing approach to children, relationships, politics and culture has all been coloured more by a Romantic spirit than by a Classical one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4358" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I.jpeg?resize=635%2C480" alt="1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both Romantic and Classical orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other. But because a good life requires a judicious balance of both, at this point in history, it might be the Classical attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently. It is a mode of approaching life which is ripe for rediscovery – and it can be repeatedly sampled in these pages.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anyone we could marry would, of course, be a little wrong for us. It is wise to be appropriately pessimistic here. Perfection is not on the cards. Unhappiness is a constant. Nevertheless, one encounters some couples of such primal, grinding mismatch, such deep-seated incompatibility, that one has to conclude that something else is at play beyond the normal disappointments and tensions of every long-term relationship: some people simply shouldn’t be together.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/diana2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4360" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/diana2.jpg?resize=635%2C571" alt="Prince Charles, Prince of Wales with his fiance Lady Diana S" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How do the errors happen? With appalling ease and regularity. Given that marrying the wrong person is about the single easiest and also costliest mistake any of us can make (and one which places an enormous burden on the state, employers and the next generation), it is extraordinary, and almost criminal, that the issue of marrying intelligently is not more systematically addressed at a national and personal level, as road safety or smoking are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s all the sadder because in truth, the reasons why people make the wrong choices are easy to lay out and unsurprising in their structure. They tend to fall into some of the following basic categories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: We don’t understand ourselves</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/viv.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4361" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/viv.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">© Agatha A. Nitecka</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When first looking out for a partner, the requirements we come up with are coloured by a beautiful non-specific sentimental vagueness: we’ll say we really want to find someone who is ‘kind’ or ‘fun to be with’, ‘attractive’ or ‘up for adventure…’</span></p>
<p class="p2">It isn’t that such desires are wrong, they are just not remotely precise enough in their understanding of what we<em> in particular</em> are going to require in order to stand a chance of being happy – or, more accurately, not consistently miserable.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us are crazy in very particular ways. We’re distinctively neurotic, unbalanced and immature, but don’t know quite the details because no one ever encourages us too hard to find them out. An urgent, primary task of any lover is therefore to get a handle on the specific ways in which they are mad. They have to get up to speed on their individual neuroses. They have to grasp where these have come from, what they make them do – and most importantly, what sort of people either provoke or assuage them. A good partnership is not so much one between two healthy people (there aren’t many of these on the planet), it’s one between two demented people who have had the skill or luck to find a non-threatening conscious accommodation between their relative insanities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The very idea that we might not be too difficult as people should set off alarm bells in any prospective partner. The question is just where the problems will lie: perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us, or we can only relax when we are working, or we’re a bit tricky around intimacy after sex, or we’ve never been so good at explaining what’s going on when we’re worried. It’s these sort of issues that – over decades – create catastrophes and that we therefore need to know about way ahead of time, in order to look out for people who are optimally designed to withstand them. A standard question on any early dinner date should be quite simply: ‘And how are you mad?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-692" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/woody.jpg" alt="Marital Problems" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that knowledge of our own neuroses is not at all easy to come by. It can take years and situations we have had no experience of. Prior to marriage, we’re rarely involved in dynamics that properly hold up a mirror to our disturbances. Whenever more casual relationships threaten to reveal the ‘difficult’ side of our natures, we tend to blame the partner – and call it a day. As for our friends, they predictably don’t care enough about us to have any motive to probe our real selves. They only want a nice evening out. Therefore, we end up blind to the awkward sides of our natures. On our own, when we’re furious, we don’t shout, as there’s no one there to listen – and therefore we overlook the true, worrying strength of our capacity for fury. Or we work all the time without grasping, because there’s no one calling us to come for dinner, how we manically use work to gain a sense of control over life – and how we might cause hell if anyone tried to stop us. At night, all we’re aware of is how sweet it would be to cuddle with someone, but we have no opportunity to face up to the intimacy-avoiding side of us that would start to make us cold and strange if ever it felt we were too deeply committed to someone. One of the greatest privileges of being on one’s own is the flattering illusion that one is, in truth, really quite an easy person to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With such a poor level of understanding of our characters, no wonder we aren’t in any position to know who we should be looking out for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We don’t understand other people</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This problem is compounded because other people are stuck at the same low level of self-knowledge as we are. However well-meaning they might be, they too are in no position to grasp, let alone inform us, of what is wrong with them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Naturally, we make a stab at trying to know them. We go and visit their families, perhaps the place they first went to school. We look at photos, we meet their friends. All this contributes to a sense we’ve done our homework. But it’s like a novice pilot assuming they can fly after sending a paper plane successfully around the room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/60scouple.jpg" alt="COUPLES - 1964" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a wiser society, prospective partners would put each other through detailed psychological questionnaires and send themselves off to be assessed at length by teams of psychologists. By 2100, this will no longer sound like a joke. The mystery will be why it took humanity so long to get to this point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to know the intimate functioning of the psyche of the person we’re planning to marry. We need to know their attitudes to, or stance on, authority, humiliation, introspection, sexual intimacy, projection, money, children, aging, fidelity and a hundred things besides. This knowledge won’t be available via a standard chat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of all this, we are led – in large part – by what they look like. There seems to be so much information to be gleaned from their eyes, nose, shape of forehead, distribution of freckles, smiles… But this is about as wise as thinking that a photograph of the outside of a power station can tell us everything we need to know about nuclear fission.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ‘project’ a range of perfections into the beloved on the basis of only a little evidence. In elaborating a whole personality from a few small – but hugely evocative – details, we are doing for the inner character of a person what our eyes naturally do with the sketch of a face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4352" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_1951" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t see this as a picture of someone who has no nostrils, eight strands of hair and no eyelashes. Without even noticing that we are doing it, we fill in the missing parts. Our brains are primed to take tiny visual hints and construct entire figures from them – and we do the same when it comes to the character of our prospective spouse. We are – much more than we give ourselves credit for, and to our great cost – inveterate artists of elaboration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The level of knowledge we need for a marriage to work is higher than our society is prepared to countenance, recognise and accommodate for – and therefore our social practices around getting married are deeply wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: We aren’t used to being happy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe we seek happiness in love, but it’s not quite as simple. What at times it seems we actually seek is <em>familiarity</em> – which may well complicate any plans we might have for happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We recreate in adult relationships some of the feelings we knew in childhood. It was as children that we first came to know and understand what love meant. But unfortunately, the lessons we picked up may not have been straightforward. The love we knew as children may have come entwined with other, less pleasant dynamics: being controlled, feeling humiliated, being abandoned, never communicating, in short: suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As adults, we may then reject certain healthy candidates whom we encounter, not because they are wrong, but precisely because they are too well-balanced (too mature, too understanding, too reliable), and this rightness feels unfamiliar and alien, almost oppressive. We head instead to candidates whom our unconscious is drawn to, not because they will please us, but because they will frustrate us in familiar ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We marry the wrong people because the right ones feel wrong – undeserved; because we have no experience of health, because we don’t ultimately associate being loved with feeling satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Being single is so awful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One is never in a good frame of mind to choose a partner rationally when remaining single is unbearable. We have to be utterly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship. Or we’ll love no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us being so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, after a certain age, society makes singlehood dangerously unpleasant. Communal life starts to wither, couples are too threatened by the independence of the single to invite them around very often, one starts to feel a freak when going to the cinema alone. Sex is hard to come by as well. For all the new gadgets and supposed freedoms of modernity, it can be very hard to get laid – and expecting to do so regularly with new people is bound to end in disappointment after 30.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bar.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far better to rearrange society so that it resembles a university or a kibbutz – with communal eating, shared facilities, constant parties and free sexual mingling… That way, anyone who did decide marriage was for them would be sure they were doing it for the positives of coupledom rather than as an escape from the negatives of singlehood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When sex was only available within marriage, people recognised that this led people to marry for the wrong reasons: to obtain something that was artificially restricted in society as a whole. People are free to make much better choices about who they marry now they’re not simply responding to a desperate desire for sex.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we retain shortages in other areas. When company is only properly available in couples, people will pair up just to spare themselves loneliness. It’s time to liberate ‘companionship’ from the shackles of coupledom, and make it as widely and as easily available as sexual liberators wanted sex to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Instinct has too much prestige</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Back in the olden days, marriage was a rational business; all to do with matching your bit of land with theirs. It was cold, ruthless and disconnected from the happiness of the protagonists. We are still traumatised by this.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/medieval1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4363" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/medieval1.jpg?resize=635%2C569" alt="Medieval miniature. Meeting of the Roman Senate. Discussion on marriage between a plebeian woman and a roman patrician. 15th century." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What replaced the marriage of reason was the marriage of instinct, the Romantic marriage. It dictated that how one felt about someone should be the only guide to marriage. If one felt ‘in love’, that was enough. No more questions asked. Feeling was triumphant. Outsiders could only applaud the feeling’s arrival, respecting it as one might the visitation of a divine spirit. Parents might be aghast, but they had to suppose that only the couple could ever know. We have for three hundred years been in collective reaction against thousands of years of very unhelpful interference based on prejudice, snobbery and lack of imagination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marilyn1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4364" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marilyn1.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="T,V, and Films, 16th January 1954, San Francisco, USA, Legendary Hollywood Film actress Marilyn Monroe prepares to kiss her husband former US Baseball player Joe DiMaggio after their wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So pedantic and cautious was the old ‘marriage of reason’ that one of the features of the marriage of feeling is its belief that one shouldn’t think too much about why one is marrying. To analyse the decision feels ‘un-Romantic’. To write out charts of pros and cons seems absurd and cold. The most Romantic thing one can do is just to propose quickly and suddenly, perhaps after only a few weeks, in a rush of enthusiasm – without any chance to do the horrible ‘reasoning’ that guaranteed misery to people for thousands of years previously. The recklessness at play seems a sign that the marriage can work, precisely because the old kind of ‘safety’ was such a danger to one’s happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: We don’t go to Schools of Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The time has come for a third kind of marriage. The marriage of psychology. One where one doesn’t marry for land, or for ‘the feeling’ alone, but only when ‘the feeling’ has been properly submitted to examination and brought under the aegis of a mature awareness of one’s own and the other’s psychology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-713" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LOVE1.jpg" alt="School children walk behind three-dimens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Presently, we marry without any information. We almost never read books specifically on the subject, we never spend more than a short time with children, we don’t rigorously interrogate other married couples or speak with any sincerity to divorced ones. We go into it without any insightful reasons as to why marriages fail – beyond what we presume to be the idiocy or lack of imagination of their protagonists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the age of the marriage of reason, one might have considered the following criteria when marrying:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- who are their parents</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how much land do they have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how culturally similar are they</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Romantic age, one might have looked out for the following signs to determine rightness:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one can’t stop thinking of a lover</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one is sexually obsessed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one thinks they are amazing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one longs to talk to them all the time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a new set of criteria. We should wonder:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how are they mad</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one raise children with them</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one develop together</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one remain friends</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: We want to freeze happiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have a desperate and fateful urge to try to make nice things permanent. We want to own the car we like, we want to live in the country we enjoyed as a tourist. And we want to marry the person we are having a terrific time with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We imagine that marriage is a guarantor of the happiness we’re enjoying with someone. It will make permanent what might otherwise be fleeting. It will help us to bottle our joy – the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing gold flakes across the sea, the prospect of dinner in a little fish restaurant, our beloved in a cashmere jumper in our arms… We got married to make this feeling permanent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-704" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn.jpg" alt="Katharine Hepburn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, there is no causal necessary connection between marriage and this sort of feeling. The feeling was produced by Venice, a time of day, a lack of work, an excitement at dinner, a two month acquaintance with someone… none of which ‘marriage’ increases or guarantees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage doesn’t freeze the moment at all. That moment was dependent on the fact that you had only known each other for a bit, that you weren’t working, that you were staying in a beautiful hotel near the Grand Canal, that you’d had a pleasant afternoon in the Guggenheim museum, that you’d just had a chocolate gelato…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting married has no power to keep a relationship at this beautiful stage. It is not in command of the ingredients of our happiness at that point. In fact, marriage will decisively move the relationship on to another, very different moment: to a suburban house, a long commute, two small children. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Impressionist painters of the nineteenth century had an implicit philosophy of transience that points us in a wiser direction. They accepted the transience of happiness as an inherent feature of existence and could in turn help us to grow more at peace with it. Sisley’s painting of a winter scene in France focuses on a set of attractive but utterly fugitive things. Towards dusk, the sun nearly breaks through the landscape. For a little time, the glow of the sky makes the bare branches less severe. The snow and the grey walls have a quiet harmony; the cold seems manageable, almost exciting. In a few minutes, night will close in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-705" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wateringplace.jpg" alt="wateringplace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impressionism is interested in the fact that the things we love most change, are only around a very short time and then disappear. It celebrates the sort of happiness that lasts a few minutes, rather than years. In this painting, the snow looks lovely; but it will melt. The sky is beautiful at this moment, but it is about to go dark. This style of art cultivates a skill that extends far beyond art itself: a skill at accepting and attending to short-lived moments of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The peaks of life tend to be brief. Happiness doesn’t come in year-long blocks. With the Impressionists to guide us, we should be ready to appreciate isolated moments of everyday paradise whenever they come our way, without making the mistake of thinking them permanent; without the need to turn them into a ‘marriage’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: We believe we are special</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The statistics are not encouraging. Everyone has before them plenty of examples of terrible marriages. They’ve seen their friends try it and come unstuck. They know perfectly well that – in general – marriages face immense challenges. And yet we do not easily apply this insight to our own case. Without specifically formulating it, we assume that this is a rule that applies to other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because a raw statistical chance of one in two of failing at marriage seems wholly acceptable, given that – when one is in love – one feels one has already beaten far more extraordinary odds. The beloved feels like around one in a million. With such a winning streak, the gamble of marrying a person seem entirely containable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We silently exclude ourselves from the generalisation. We’re not to be blamed for this. But we could benefit from being encouraged to see ourselves as exposed to the general fate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: We want to stop thinking about Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before we get married, we are likely to have had many years of turbulence in our love lives. We have tried to get together with people who didn’t like us, we’ve started and broken up unions, we’ve gone out for endless parties, in the hope of meeting someone, and known excitement and bitter disappointments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No wonder if, at a certain point, we have enough of all that. Part of the reason we feel like getting married is to interrupt the all-consuming grip that love has over our psyches. We are exhausted by the melodramas and thrills that go nowhere. We are restless for other challenges. We hope that marriage can conclusively end love’s painful rule over our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-707" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/gaywedding.jpg" alt="Wedding Bells Ring For Same Sex Couple In Washington, D.C." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can’t and won’t: there is as much doubt, hope, fear, rejection and betrayal in a marriage as there is in single life. It’s only from the outside that a marriage looks peaceful, uneventful and nicely boring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">****</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Preparing us for marriage is, ideally, an educational task that falls on culture as a whole. We have stopped believing in dynastic marriages. We are starting to see the drawbacks of Romantic marriages. Now comes the time for psychological marriages.</span></p>
