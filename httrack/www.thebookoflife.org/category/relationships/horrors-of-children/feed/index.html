				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the wonders of the human mind is its ability constantly to improve its bank of knowledge: to update and correct its errors; in other words, to over-write the disc.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pctechguide.com/images/31harddrive.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This capacity for updating holds true in almost all areas (economics, algebra, cooking&#8230;). But there is an exception in one cognitive field with perhaps the single largest impact on adult life and on our chances of happiness: emotional knowledge.</p>
<p>It is during the time we are very small children, between our first day and around our eighth year, that the disc is encoded. It is in this period that we learn whether we can trust, whether we like ourselves, whether we can be open, where blame belongs, what to do when the world hurts us, how much we can tell others of what distresses us, what degree of directness can be tolerated; and how much of our naughtiness and excitement can be witnessed and forgiven.</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i2.wp.com/anxietyfreechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/the_dark.jpg?resize=668%2C445" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for humankind, a catastrophic amount can go wrong here. Despite all the improvements in early infant care that has taken place in the last century, without anyone meaning for this to happen, it remains pretty easy to pick up some properly unhelpful lessons in these years, way before we can understand what&#8217;s going on, let alone tell anyone or move away from trouble. We may acquire a lack of trust, an excessive fear of humiliation, a shame about our bodies, indirect patterns of communication and an inability either to be close to someone or tolerate a sane measure of distance from them.</p>
<p><img src="http://i1.wp.com/www.psychalive.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/iStock_000006846493Small1-father-scolding-child.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We might assume that these failures can simply get corrected &#8211; just like an early error when doing quadratic equations. And yet we are likely to realise, especially with age, how stubbornly encoded the faults really are.</p>
<p>This can feel absurd and humiliating. There&#8217;s an understandably impatient view that one should, of course, &#8216;get over&#8217; one&#8217;s childhood. After all, so many other areas of knowledge are amenable to constant and very necessary correction, it seems daft that we shouldn&#8217;t be able to overwrite the lessons we once acquired in the emotional field; it is as if someone who normally drives an elegant sedan were, in one area of life, always to have to go back and crouch on a tricycle in order to get around. We&#8217;re liable to get impatient with people close to fifty who are still talking in wounded terms about their parents (now long dead) who said something a little humiliating to them in the opening years of the Nixon administration. And within oneself, there&#8217;s an understandable tendency to assume that one must really be as &#8216;adult&#8217; in the emotional realm as one is when chairing a meeting or dealing with the IT challenges in the Copenhagen branch.</p>
<p>But this impatient brusqueness with the patterns laid down in childhood, though deeply understandable, causes us a raft of problems, for it means we can be neither compassionate about where some pretty odd behaviour may be coming from in others (especially when one is in a relationship with them); nor, in our self-understanding, are we careful enough about interpreting our impulses. It may simply be wisest to accept that there will at points be a furious, unhinged inner five year old who will take charge, refuse to cede the controls and attempt to cause mayhem.</p>
<p>We have to be aware of moments when we misread situations and unleash difficulties on those close to us that a mature adult would never consciously want to set loose. We should know that we may be enduringly and deeply wounded and must, therefore, when we can manage it, find words to warn those we care about what living with us will mean.</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i0.wp.com/i.huffpost.com/gen/1438303/images/o-COUPLE-FIGHTING-facebook.jpg?resize=684%2C342" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dark awareness has consequences for childraising too. Parenthood is often so arduous and its rewards so unclear, it can be restorative to receive a few stark reminders of why one is going to so much trouble, and quite why the sacrifices matter. Time with the kids isn&#8217;t about aiming for work-life balance in the name of a bit of fun at home. It&#8217;s about ensuring the mental health of the next generation. A child-centered, emotionally-intelligent environment means they won&#8217;t have to be constantly scared of closeness, will be able to enjoy sex and will have the health to pick a partner who will be more or less good for them.</p>
<p>The great learning of 20th century psychology (still only patchily assimilated) is that those early years are, emotionally, simply everything. It would be substantially easier if it weren&#8217;t so, but a die is cast then that can almost never be reshaped. We are more or less the life-long prisoners of dynamics that may have been set in motion half a century ago by parents who were not even mean, just under inner duress. It&#8217;s a sobering situation that calls for humility, forgiveness, constant vigilance over one&#8217;s own conduct, polite warnings to others &#8211; and a very black sense of humour.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anyone of childbearing age will be surrounded by examples of catastrophic parenting in their own and previous generations. We hear no end of gruesome stories about breakdowns and resentments, shame and addiction, chronic failures of self-confidence and inabilities to form satisfying relationships. And at the root of all these varieties of suffering, one central cause sticks out: a lack of love. It was because the parents were remote and domineering, unreliable and frightening that life has never been quite complete.</p>
<p class="p1">From such failures, a major assumption has come to dominate modern ideals of parenting: that one must, above all else, love one’s child thoroughly, with immense sympathy, gentleness and kindness and that if one does so, the child will develop into a happy, loving and fulfilled human being.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the Romantic view of parenting and it is at its most vivid and self-assured in the early years, especially at moments when the child (finally) lies asleep in its cot, defenceless before the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/baby-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4461" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/baby-1.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="Official Pictures of Princess Estelle Silvia Ewa Mary of Sweden, Duchess of Ostergotland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, despite immense investments and profound devotion, one is – gradually – liable to be inducted into a far more complex and challenging set of truths: that love is not a universal panacea and that giving unconditional affection is no guarantee of all the results one had hoped for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The terrifying 3am truths about parenting run a little like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You are a punchbag</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blades of your child’s remote-controlled helicopter snapped after five minutes, just as you were starting to get the hang of flying it. The fault lies squarely with the manufacturers. But, sadly, they were not present in the kitchen – so, at once and not for the first time, you became the target for the raging disappointment of your child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481684085.jpg" alt="Nursery" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The repeated bad behaviour is surprising of course (it wasn’t meant to be that way), but it is a perverse sort of tribute to you nevertheless. One has to feel rather safe around someone in order to be this difficult. You certainly weren’t so tricky with your parents when you were young, but then again, you never felt so loved. All those assurances – ‘I will always be on your side’ – have paid off perfectly: they have encouraged your child to direct their every frustration and disappointment onto the loving adult who has signalled that they can, and will, take it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You have to be the spoil sport</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human nature has a strong – and exceedingly inconvenient – bias towards indulging in whatever is most immediately pleasant and fun. And yet the central, unavoidable task of being a loving parent is to encourage the child to delay gratification in the interests of longer-term fulfilment. That’s why there will be fights. Constantly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After all, it is so much nicer to play Minecraft than to learn how to spell ‘scythe’ or ‘embarrassment’; so much more amusing to see what happens if you put a hosepipe in the car’s exhaust than to do maths homework; so much better to read a magazine than brush one’s teeth, so much more gratifying to stay in bed than have a shower.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90767435.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4457" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90767435.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="Two children playing while a man reads a newspaper, c 1949." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of love, a parent must – all the time, in small ways and large – say no. And for this, they will be severely punished. They will be treated as if they had arbitrarily made up the mechanics of tooth decay or had designed an economic system where the playing of computer games was disconnected from a capacity to pay bills. They will be punished for always bringing up unwelcome facts. And they will be very unfavourably compared with people who give the child whatever they want – because they just don’t care about them. It’s the thoughtless hedonistic characters, the ones who suggest all-night cartoon sessions and come around with iPads, who will be viewed as the heroes while the caring, denying parent has to contend with being called a ‘meanie’ and, later perhaps, a fascist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You have to exert authority rather than teach</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream is to coax the child into doing certain difficult things without ever having to demand they do so by force. The dream is not to have to ‘exert authority’, by which one means, bypass reason in order to impose a conclusion. The dream is to teach, and never to rely on the more basic weapons, like the assertion that one is the older, richer, bigger party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thinks with distaste of the Victorian parent demanding obedience simply by saying ‘I am your mother, I am your father’. To the child, the meaning of these words, mother and father, have changed entirely; they now mean merely ‘someone who will make it nice for me’ and ‘someone I will agree with if I see the point of what they’re saying.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But attempts to teach and appeal to a child’s reason can only go so far. Whatever one says in a gentle voice, the children won’t eat vegetables; they won’t want to get out of bed in the morning; they will want to mock their younger brother or sister; they won’t stop playing the computer game.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the child is very small, it is easy enough to deal with these protests: one can just lift them up or distract them in some kindly way for a moment. But later, by six, one has to use authority: one must simply assert that one knows best without explaining one’s reasons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The child wouldn’t have the relevant bits of experience that would render one’s lessons comprehensible. A nine-year-old girl cannot understand how humiliating her six-year-old brother physically is a bad idea because this might make it hard for him to relate easily to women when he is older. It isn’t her fault she can’t understand. It would indeed be wholly unreasonable to expect a nine-year-old to be reasonable – and correctly comprehend the force and direction of adult concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream is that one will be able to pass on insights to the child that were painfully accumulated through experience, and thereby save them time. But in the absence of experience, insight doesn’t work. One cannot rush children to conclusions; one cannot spare them time. They will need, with difficulty, to make many of the same mistakes (and a few new ones too) and waste a good part of their lives finding out what you already know full well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t make things too nice for them</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern culture is deeply vexed – and appalled – by the thought that development might require suffering. We have been traumatised by the barbaric old-fashioned enthusiasm for punishment, the view – expressed by generations of sadistic Victorian school masters – that success demands pain, that there is a necessary relationship between early discomfort and humiliation and later strength and ‘character’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/78948425-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4463" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/78948425-1.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="Volume 2, Page 74, Picture, 1. A picture of a mother telling off her son. 1958" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we have not merely rejected the Victorian mechanisms for inflicting suffering (the cold showers, the beatings), we have for the most part sought to abolish suffering altogether. Kindness has been triumphant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet this attempt to abolish suffering involves waging a counter-productive and ultimately cruel war with the facts of human nature. We know from our own experience that we have at key moments grown through things that had a painful side to them: that there were terrors, rejections and disappointments that – in the end – made us more mature and better able to pursue our goals. We know that the drive to accomplish certain things, to master some difficult material, to win out over others, gained some of its power from fear and desperate insecurity. Because someone (perhaps a parent) didn’t believe in us, we redoubled one’s efforts. Because we were afraid of the consequences of failure, because succeeding was the only way to impress someone we loved but who wasn’t easily impressed, we put on an extra spurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We desperately want our child to grow mature but without going through awful things. We hate being an agent of fear. We want always to cheer and to hug. We want everything to be nice. Yet we also know, in our hearts, that this can only be a path to ruin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t guarantee their goodness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of existence sees all humans as fundamentally good from birth: it is only upbringing and a lack of love that corrupts and damages us and in the process, makes us cruel. Romanticism states that if only a child can grow up anxiety free, secure and encased in love, it will never break another child’s toy, rip up their paintings or try to scare them. The child will be reliably kind if she or he has reliably been shown kindness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But experience suggests the existence of some ineluctably dark sides hard-wired in us and beyond the reach of the gentlest behaviour: certain kinds of aggression, cruelty and violence appear to be a given. A child may just want to hit its sibling out of excess vitality, boredom or native sadism. It might just be fun to smack someone in the face to see what happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why there used to be such an emphasis on manners. Those who upheld them didn’t believe that a child ever could be spontaneously good simply because they’d been shown love. Indeed, a firm denial of love was what was necessary to help the child to create a wall between what they might feel inside and what they knew they could express with others. Being strict wasn’t a route to making anyone evil, it was a way to teach a person to keep their evil firmly locked up inside themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t guarantee their success</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern parent believes that it might be possible to mould a happy, fulfilled, successful human. From this flows the minute attention to detail, from the purchase of the cot to the time-tabling of after-school activities. It is this that explains the Mandarin lessons, the French horn, the educational trips to the countryside and the ruinous tutor fees – because with all this in place, fate and failure can surely be kept at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reading1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4467" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reading1.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="Book At Bedtime" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the relationship between effort and return is more bizarre and more random. We cannot spare those we love the cup of human sorrow – whatever the intensity of our after-school programmes. We are always statistically most likely to give birth to mediocrities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>You will be forgotten</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You take great care not to be frightening. You make silly jokes, put on funny voices, pretend to be a bear or a camel – all so as not to intimidate, so as to be approachable, the way one’s own parents were not. It should be a recipe for reciprocated love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But weirdly, we rather like difficult people in a way, people we can’t quite read, who aren’t around so often, who are a bit scary. They hook us in – in a way the kind, stable ones never quite do. One loses authority by being natural, approachable, friendly, a bit daft, the clown who doesn’t want to scare.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An even more dispiriting thought comes to mind. Love them reliably and without fear and you will be forgotten. Be distant, intermittent, often absent and deeply volatile, and they will be obsessed with you for life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And with these thoughts fully aired, it will be time for the kindly parent to attempt to return to sleep. It will be a long day – with the kids – tomorrow.</span></p>
