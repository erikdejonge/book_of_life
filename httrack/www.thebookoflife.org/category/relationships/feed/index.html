				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At moments of low self-esteem, it can be hard to avoid the fear that we may &#8211; and this might explain certain relationship hiccups &#8211; be really quite ‘bad in bed’. Three anxieties tend to predominate:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- that our bodies are not attractive enough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- that we don’t practice or know about certain positions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and that we tire too easily</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9094" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These fears reflect an underlying view that sex is predominantly an athletic or aerobic activity &#8211; and that therefore ‘good sex’ must hinge on a capacity to flex our bodies optimally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this risks misunderstanding what lies at the core of eroticism, for though sex traditionally makes use of our bodies, sexual pleasure may more accurately be thought of as stemming from certain manoeuvres of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As new technology is showing us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is quite possible for two people to generate extraordinary eroticism while their bodies are a continent or more apart.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10503006553_e3026821e8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9097" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10503006553_e3026821e8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="10503006553_e3026821e8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because eroticism is &#8211; in truth &#8211; about something else entirely: ideas. Being a good lover is first and foremost a skill of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex grows pleasurable the more it functions as a release from a great many of the ideas of what is normal that dominate in non-sexual life. Good sex allows us to admit to, and share, a maximal amount of what we must normally keep hidden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In good sex, we will &#8211; for example &#8211; be allowed to show that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We’re more interested in controlling and dominating someone that we normally let on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Or conversely that we’re very keen to submit and be entirely weak</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might want to subvert the hierarchies of normal life by exploring scenarios of pilots and cabin attendants, professors and students, patients and doctors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might confess that, though monogamous by nature, the idea of other people watching us or joining us excites us really rather a lot</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5611721195_8c0d367312_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9092" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5611721195_8c0d367312_z.jpg?resize=635%2C604" alt="5611721195_8c0d367312_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Or we may reveal that our erotic interests don’t actually &#8211; as they’re meant to &#8211; circle exclusively around genitals; that we’re really pretty interested in more incidental things like wrists or the back of necks or indeed shoes or tights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might be brave enough to challenge the normal chronological rules, revealing that we’d like to spend a hugely long time with our clothes still on &#8211; or indeed rush straight in without decorum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexiness is the excitement of feeling released from the restrictive taboos of the rest of our lives. It’s a safe, mutually caring place where we can take someone else into the not entirely responsible, somewhat cruel and mad sides of us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7556699760_38f5447be5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9100" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7556699760_38f5447be5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C377" alt="7556699760_38f5447be5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That someone gives us permission to do this, that is at the core of what sexiness is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who is good in bed isn’t the one who knows how to articulate themselves rhythmically for extended periods: it’s the person who encourages, endorses and legitimates our secret lonely selves at the same time as being very aware of, and honest about, their own private wishes and enthusiasms. It’s about a mutual nakedness of the mind, made possible through trust.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being in a relationship where it doesn’t feel like there is enough sex sounds like a trivial and somewhat comedic luxury problem, as though someone were complaining there wasn’t enough tennis or yoga between a couple.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But an absence of sex isn’t trivial in the least, it is humblingly serious and might even be what either guarantees or dooms the relationship itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One statistic stands out. In an average year in the OECD countries, 70% of those who initiated divorce cited a lack of sex as the first or second reason for parting. If there’s one generalisation we can make about couples, it’s that a lack of sex &#8211; by which we mean, less than four times a month &#8211; is an alarm bell we should listen to.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6554108407_1e12449aaa_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8938" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6554108407_1e12449aaa_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6554108407_1e12449aaa_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is sex such a key part of keeping two people close?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because in sex, two people accept each other in the most profound of ways. The apparently dirty and shameful sides of us, the wayward fantasies and the unusual longings, are legitimated through sex. Someone else witnesses and accepts us as bodily and psychological beings. Sex symbolises an end to loneliness and a reaffirmation of trust. Not daring or wanting to have sex with a partner is tantamount to admitting that one can&#8217;t be oneself in their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of sex is bad enough, but far worse is the way in which the unreciprocated longing for sex manifests itself. Typically, the person who wants it:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- doesn’t ask very clearly: maybe merely sliding a hand over in a timid, half-hearted search for reciprocation</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8951" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- they don’t complain calmly, don’t deliver an eloquent self-confident speech about how difficult they are finding it &#8211; and don’t enquire sympathetically as to what might be going on in the partner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- they tend to quickly move on to symptomatic behaviour wherein their disappointment and sense of humiliation are acted out rather than discussed: they bang dishes. They get mean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whole raft of conflicts then develops that has ostensibly nothing to do with sex and yet is caused by its absence. One starts squabbling over the in-laws and the state of the kitchen. The one who has been let down sexually behaves so badly, they start to seem like a monster; further reducing the chance of sex ever taking place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the sex starved party may simply go off on and have an affair, not because they don’t love their partner, but because showing their desire has become so fraught with rejection that they are out for a bit of revenge.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175348183_561b1cf170_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8944" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175348183_561b1cf170_b.jpg?resize=635%2C618" alt="6175348183_561b1cf170_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack-of-sex discussion is so hard to have because, quite simply, it feels so shameful to be unwanted sexually. It plays into every worst fear about unacceptability. It’s bad enough when it happens on a date, it’s even sadder to have to admit that one is being rejected by one’s partner inside the apparent safety and commitment of a long-term relationship. Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with them, but far more likely, there&#8217;s something revolting about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key to a process of reconciliation is to reign in one’s wilder feelings of rejection and self-disgust &#8211; in order to be able to consider why the other party might have gone off sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key fact: everyone wants sex in principle. When it isn’t wanted, it’s because a condition for sex is not being met, and then not communicated. Privately, the sex-rejecting party has a problem they are not sharing. They might in secret be thinking: I might have sex:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if only you listened more to my problems with my family</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you gave me more time to do my work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you weren’t so mean to me around domestic chores</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be kinkier reasons: I’d have more sex if: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- you allowed me to play out certain fantasies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you were more broad minded about role playing </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you were more into kissing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or wanted it rough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or could be more submissive.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4987626744_9ff76e1571_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8953" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4987626744_9ff76e1571_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="DSC_3966 copy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person being denied sex hasn’t usually had any chance to hear these reasons in plain unaccusing gentle terms. Or maybe they’ve heard them without a sober awareness of what is really at stake here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s been no proper communication. Therefore, a classic recommendation, deliberately artificial, is that the two parties &#8211; aware that their entire relationship probably depends on getting this right &#8211; should write each other a letter, titled simply: ‘What I want from sex.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance to be deeply honest about your true sexual identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is then incumbent on both parties to take the other’s words seriously and in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people are always going to be a bit sexually incompatible &#8211; but we should not get so scared and angry at this that we create a secondary barrier of hurt, punishment and shame.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8947" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C540" alt="6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should take the first steps to finding a way in which what you want and what they want can in a modest way be harmonised – and the sarcasm and banged dishes can stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time such a conversation about sex happens in the quiet of the night, the angels of relationships hover over the bedroom and sound their silent trumpets in celebration &#8211; because another couple have just critically improved their chances of lasting a little longer together.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too often, affairs are seen as the outcome of random horniness &#8211; or just plain old nastiness.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s very rarely the case. When it comes to affairs, we spend far too long being incensed or secretive, and far too little time trying to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, affairs stem from a very fiddly aspect of our romantic psychology.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175347625_a41657c6b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8919" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175347625_a41657c6b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6175347625_a41657c6b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our relationships with a partner, all of us need carefully calibrated mixtures of two different ingredients. We have A Need for Closeness and A Need for Distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want, in part a Closeness where we can hug, touch, be cosy, intimate and entirely relaxed and at home with someone. We want them to know our thoughts and to wander freely in their minds too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we also need Distance enough not to feel cloyingly submerged, subsumed or owned by another. We want to retain a sense of freedom. We need a private room to which we alone have the key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any imbalances, towards Over- Closeness or Over- Distance, will prove catastrophic if left unaddressed.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/915591764_3a755d1b13_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8921" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/915591764_3a755d1b13_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="915591764_3a755d1b13_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a relationship which threatens to lean perilously towards over-closeness, we can be driven to stray by a powerful urge to prove to ourselves that not everything we do and are is owned by the partner; that we remain desirable to the world and a going concern in and of ourselves. Going to bed with a new person might not be simply about lust: it’s about escaping the alarming feeling that one’s whole identity appears to be dissolving into the couple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But too much distance can undermine fidelity no less powerfully. The distance reads like constant rejection: when we try to touch the partner, they move away or sigh. When we bring up something personal, they change the subject. We may end up having an affair, not because we don’t love the partner any more but precisely because we do &#8211; and yet the distance they appear to be imposing on us through their lack of engagement feels unendurable and humiliating. It’s the final irony that &#8211; if caught &#8211; we’ll be accused of not caring, when it was caring too much that might have inspired the whole mistaken escapade in the first place.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10613938613_08411a938d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8923" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10613938613_08411a938d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="10613938613_08411a938d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragically, two people almost never enter a relationship with the same needs for Distance and Closeness. That’s why in every couple, we invariably hear the accusation that one person is too ‘clingy’ and another is ‘cold’. These are unhelpfully vicious words for what are, at heart, just two different ways of feeling comfortable in love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s therefore an early imperative in any relationship to work out what the relative needs for Distance and Closeness are, to air the disjuncture, not to get angry about it, and mutually and with good humour to apologise for one’s distinctive contribution to it. Only thus can we hope to ensure that the gap won’t lead &#8211; in an online chat, at a bar or at a conference &#8211; to a situation where only an affair feels like a plausible solution to the vexing problems of Distance and Closeness.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are outstanding lawyers, not so much in professional contexts, as in our personal relationships. We know exactly how to do two ‘lawyerly’ things extremely well: make our opponents look like idiots and exonerate ourselves. Unfortunately, our courtroom talents &#8211; however dazzling &#8211; don’t really get us anywhere in the long term, because the point of a relationship isn’t to humiliate and ridicule a defendant, but to feel safe around, and close to a partner.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/anglotopia.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/04law-span-articleLarge.jpg?resize=600%2C365" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t about being &#8216;right&#8217;, they&#8217;re about mutual understanding. In order to foster harmony, we need to tame our inner lawyers and harness their talents towards more fruitful ends. With this aim in mind, we should consider performing a new exercise we’ve called a <strong>Couple Courtroom Game</strong>, a game in which we task our inner lawyers with an unfamiliar challenge: ceasing to represent us and taking on a new and unusual client: our partners. Rather than making us look good, as they know how to do so thoroughly and with such dogged energy, our inner lawyers should for a time dare to represent our partners in their stand-offs against us. It&#8217;s a way of doing something we generally loathe: seeing things through another&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5762466757_08468bb627_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8829" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5762466757_08468bb627_z.jpg?resize=635%2C369" alt="5762466757_08468bb627_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To perform the exercise, we need to pick on an area of struggle (perhaps it&#8217;s the fight you have about plans for Christmas or the temperature for the bedroom) and proceed with the help of the following courtroom notes, drawn up for use by prosecutors who have for a time become defendants:</span></p>
<p><em><strong>How to Defend Your Former Opponent</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials should last around fifteen minutes and have at their heart one of the countless issues that bedevil couples.</span></p>
<p>1. TRY TO FRAME YOUR NEW CLIENT AS, FOR ONCE, REASONABLE</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are &#8211; normally &#8211; experts in making our partners look insane because of what they believe and want from us. Their demands (that we stay in more, go out more, have more sex, have less sex, see less family, see more family etc…) spur us on to frame them as lacking in basic reason and decency. They are, as we love carefully to present them to the jury, just crazy.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8835" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the first move for the newly defending inner lawyer is simple yet extraordinary: we must do everything in our power to make our former opponents look reasonable. We must hold back our normal instincts and try to reframe their demands as at heart decent, perhaps badly or hastily expressed but not devilish, putting the most logical and generous construction on their motives. Simply articulating this in a normal voice, without sarcasm, counts as an immense achievement. Attractive features of their characters have to be brought out, and their behaviour convincingly praised and held up for esteem. This will feel very odd.</span></p>
<p>2. UNDERMINE/NEUTRALISE THE PROSECUTION</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next task is to cast some illuminating and fair doubts on the character and motives of the prosecution (you). Argue, for a time, against yourself.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Psychobiography of the Prosecution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should gently point out that the prosecution is clearly not entirely balanced and rational themselves. They have issues of their own. If one is honest, they might have some</span> rather disturbed or damaged motives for holding their particular view, springing from their psychological past. This can be pointed out more in sorrow than in anger. They are seeking vengeance or are compensating for things that went on perhaps many years before the couple first met. They are in key ways attacking the wrong person (because perhaps their mother isn’t there and their father died a long time ago). They are taking revenge on your client unfairly. It’s what psychotherapists call ‘transference’, whereby emotions that originated in childhood are transferred onto adult situations, often without justice. The prosecution can be accused of, in large part, taking out a problem on an innocent bystander.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Polarisation</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good inner lawyer will follow this up by asking the jury to consider to what extent the accusations of the prosecution reveal concerns that the prosecuting party in fact shares with the defendant. Perhaps it isn’t just one person who is stingy, or confused about sex, or ambivalent about family. Anything that your client is charged with probably exists in the other party too: they are trying to make it seem as if it’s all on your client’s side, but immaturities tend to be fairly evenly spread among couples.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9729607890_7b319d3f14_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8833" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9729607890_7b319d3f14_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="9729607890_7b319d3f14_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>3. THE SYMPATHY MOVE: NO ANGEL BUT&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, your inner lawyer must make a strategic concession, with a view to touching the hearts of the jury. They must accept that &#8211; naturally &#8211; their client can’t be a 100% innocent. They are no angel, but… they don’t deserve everything, and it would be unfair to make their life hell. They’ve been through a difficult time. They are less dreadful than the prosecution has been alleging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe their errors spring not from evil, but from fear and anxiety. Some of this can be put down to a challenging past. It’s clearly not all their fault: anyone who had been through similar experiences would have ended up here. There are exonerating factors. The defendant is more reasonable and more deserving than the prosecution had ever been in the habit of supposing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the trial is adjourned, and may convene again for the opposite team to begin a similar exercise. Once it is all over, there will &#8211; at the very least &#8211; be a heightened sense of the basic legitimacy of the other’s point of view, and a good perspective over the forgivable stresses and anxieties that have inspired panic and aggression on both sides. Not least, we&#8217;ll remember that the point of arguing isn&#8217;t to win a court case, it&#8217;s to save a relationship.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the wonders of the human mind is its ability constantly to improve its bank of knowledge: to update and correct its errors; in other words, to over-write the disc.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.pctechguide.com/images/31harddrive.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This capacity for updating holds true in almost all areas (economics, algebra, cooking&#8230;). But there is an exception in one cognitive field with perhaps the single largest impact on adult life and on our chances of happiness: emotional knowledge.</p>
<p>It is during the time we are very small children, between our first day and around our eighth year, that the disc is encoded. It is in this period that we learn whether we can trust, whether we like ourselves, whether we can be open, where blame belongs, what to do when the world hurts us, how much we can tell others of what distresses us, what degree of directness can be tolerated; and how much of our naughtiness and excitement can be witnessed and forgiven.</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i2.wp.com/anxietyfreechild.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/the_dark.jpg?resize=668%2C445" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Unfortunately for humankind, a catastrophic amount can go wrong here. Despite all the improvements in early infant care that has taken place in the last century, without anyone meaning for this to happen, it remains pretty easy to pick up some properly unhelpful lessons in these years, way before we can understand what&#8217;s going on, let alone tell anyone or move away from trouble. We may acquire a lack of trust, an excessive fear of humiliation, a shame about our bodies, indirect patterns of communication and an inability either to be close to someone or tolerate a sane measure of distance from them.</p>
<p><img src="http://i2.wp.com/www.psychalive.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/iStock_000006846493Small1-father-scolding-child.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>We might assume that these failures can simply get corrected &#8211; just like an early error when doing quadratic equations. And yet we are likely to realise, especially with age, how stubbornly encoded the faults really are.</p>
<p>This can feel absurd and humiliating. There&#8217;s an understandably impatient view that one should, of course, &#8216;get over&#8217; one&#8217;s childhood. After all, so many other areas of knowledge are amenable to constant and very necessary correction, it seems daft that we shouldn&#8217;t be able to overwrite the lessons we once acquired in the emotional field; it is as if someone who normally drives an elegant sedan were, in one area of life, always to have to go back and crouch on a tricycle in order to get around. We&#8217;re liable to get impatient with people close to fifty who are still talking in wounded terms about their parents (now long dead) who said something a little humiliating to them in the opening years of the Nixon administration. And within oneself, there&#8217;s an understandable tendency to assume that one must really be as &#8216;adult&#8217; in the emotional realm as one is when chairing a meeting or dealing with the IT challenges in the Copenhagen branch.</p>
<p>But this impatient brusqueness with the patterns laid down in childhood, though deeply understandable, causes us a raft of problems, for it means we can be neither compassionate about where some pretty odd behaviour may be coming from in others (especially when one is in a relationship with them); nor, in our self-understanding, are we careful enough about interpreting our impulses. It may simply be wisest to accept that there will at points be a furious, unhinged inner five year old who will take charge, refuse to cede the controls and attempt to cause mayhem.</p>
<p>We have to be aware of moments when we misread situations and unleash difficulties on those close to us that a mature adult would never consciously want to set loose. We should know that we may be enduringly and deeply wounded and must, therefore, when we can manage it, find words to warn those we care about what living with us will mean.</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i2.wp.com/i.huffpost.com/gen/1438303/images/o-COUPLE-FIGHTING-facebook.jpg?resize=684%2C342" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dark awareness has consequences for childraising too. Parenthood is often so arduous and its rewards so unclear, it can be restorative to receive a few stark reminders of why one is going to so much trouble, and quite why the sacrifices matter. Time with the kids isn&#8217;t about aiming for work-life balance in the name of a bit of fun at home. It&#8217;s about ensuring the mental health of the next generation. A child-centered, emotionally-intelligent environment means they won&#8217;t have to be constantly scared of closeness, will be able to enjoy sex and will have the health to pick a partner who will be more or less good for them.</p>
<p>The great learning of 20th century psychology (still only patchily assimilated) is that those early years are, emotionally, simply everything. It would be substantially easier if it weren&#8217;t so, but a die is cast then that can almost never be reshaped. We are more or less the life-long prisoners of dynamics that may have been set in motion half a century ago by parents who were not even mean, just under inner duress. It&#8217;s a sobering situation that calls for humility, forgiveness, constant vigilance over one&#8217;s own conduct, polite warnings to others &#8211; and a very black sense of humour.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in a position of not having much sex. Often we stop trying because of something that goes a bit wrong, perhaps there were some nasty arguments or moments of impotence or some awkwardness or discomfort. But what&#8217;s worse is that failure in the past puts us off from ever really trying again. We become avoidant or shy around the whole topic and then the situation gets really fraught because a lack of physical contact quickly destroys trust and intimacy.</p>

<p>Impotence has been turned into a major medical problem and diagnosed as a psychological mishap of the first order. But it is also a very intriguing phenomenon that could throw a flattering light on its sufferers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The strange thing about love is that even though we experience it in a deeply personal and apparently instinctive way, it has a history. In other words, people around the world haven’t always fallen in love the way they do now.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of rehearsing a few of the telling moments in love’s history is to remind ourselves that there are different ways of arranging relationships, depending on what a given society happens to believe in. Love is a cultural invention and we are not at the end of its evolution. We may, in fact, still be only at the early stages of the history of love. We are still learning what we need and how we might get more successful at love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Mari, Syria, 1775 BC</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mari-290x2901.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6629" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Mari-290x2901.jpg?resize=450%2C450" alt="Mari-290x290" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">King Zimri-Lim of the ancient city of Mari, on the banks of the Euphrates, marries Shibtu, the princess of the neighbouring kingdom of Yamhad.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from being the outcome of love, this marriage, like that of many between powerful people in the ancient world, is purely transactional. Mari occupies a critical position in the trade routes between Syria and Mesopotamia, and marrying Shibtu will allow Zimri-Lim to expand his wealth and power.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zimri-Lim’s attitude to marriage continues with his children. He marries off eight of his daughters to rulers of neighbouring cities, forcing each of his new sons-in-law to sign a document pledging themselves to him.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The people of Mari are in effect saying that what gives a marriage meaning isn’t how much the couple happens to love one another, but whether it is beneficial in terms of trade, connections and war. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is so alien to us, it’s worth reflecting on just how much we nowadays refuse to entertain &#8211; at least in public &#8211; any practical considerations when marrying. Feelings are meant to be our only lodestars. Yet for thousands of years, until only a minute ago on the historical clock, it was unambiguously meant to be only about land, power and money. The notion that you should love your spouse would have seemed plain laughable. This may have created a collective trauma we’re still in flight from.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Blaye, France, 1147</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jaufré Rudel, the Prince of Blaye, sets sail for Tripoli, in modern day northern Lebanon. He is off to see the Countess of Tripoli, with whom he has fallen deeply in love. Rudel is one of the earliest known Troubadours, or skilled court poets, who rise to prominence in southern France in the 12th century and write poetry on one subject exclusively: Love. Rudel has written many poems in honour of the Countess and wants to write some more in her presence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6650" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DickseeRomeoandJuliet.jpg?resize=635%2C598" alt="DickseeRomeoandJuliet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Rudel’s idea of love is very particular and at that time, dramatically new: it’s love that’s utterly divorced from practical considerations, that doesn’t involve children, money, dynasties or even any kind of reciprocation. The Troubadour poets never try to have sex with the objects of their love. Their focus is exclusively on what we would call the infatuation &#8211; or more colloquially, the crush &#8211; side of love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rudel has fallen in love with the Countess without ever having set eyes on her. Pining away for his lady from hundreds of miles away, he composes and sets to music many songs expressing grief and joy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, he falls ill en route to the lady and has to be stretchered into Tripoli, where the countess hears about him and visits him in his chamber. Rudel recovers momentarily, before dying, finally at peace, very chastely, in her arms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jaufre_rudel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6634" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Jaufre_rudel.jpg?resize=450%2C656" alt="Jaufre_rudel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Troubadours took love very seriously, only they didn’t see it as linked to marriage. Romantic love was something you felt for someone you were never going to do household chores with. And that may be the secret of its intensity. This kind of love was spared too much contact with daily life. Rudel could imagine how lovely the Countess of Tripoli was &#8211; without ever having to dispute with her about the right place to hang a tapestry or get frustrated if she didn’t particularly want to do a special embarrassing thing for him in bed. Their love could remain pristine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Troubadours show us a historical moment when the idea of love was not tied to the notion of moving in together or to the intertwining of two practical, economic and social lives (using the same toilet, sharing utilities bills and trying to go on camping holidays with your partner’s friends). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Versailles, France, 14 September 1745</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At 6 o’clock in the evening, in a move engineered and planned for weeks, Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, a 23-year-old beauty from Paris, rouged, powdered and wearing a black off-the-shoulder dress, enters the Cabinet du Conseil, approaches King Louis XV, and curtsies three times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This simple gesture makes it official: Jeanne-Antoinette is the king’s maîtresse déclarée, or chief mistress, and from now on, she will be known as Madame du Pompadour, and reside at court with the king.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6636" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The king has, by this point, been married for 20 years, but marriage doesn’t mean fidelity. You marry for reasons of state, and have mistresses on the side. No one gets upset, that’s just what happens. Louis XV had several mistresses, including 14-year-old Marie-Louise O’Murphy, who is painted in a famous semi-pornographic painting by François Boucher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6637" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At Versailles in the 18th century, there was an acceptance of the imperfect fit between marriage and love. It was understood that there would always be a tension between the two. Marriage was for children, practicality and continuity. Love was for excitement, drama and sex. One should never try to blend the two.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than be underhand or deceitful like many people are today, the king of France simply split love from marriage &#8211; and, without shame or guilt, made his romantic attachments an organised, public part of his life with his wife. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gretna Green, Scotland, 1 January 1812</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A couple has just got married in a secret ceremony. John Lambton, the 1st Earl of Durham, who is posh and has land and responsibilities, and Harriet, the illegitimate daughter of the Earl of Cholmondeley, who has no money and little social status but is very pretty, are now man and wife.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Their families are furious &#8211; and have tried desperately to stop the wedding. But the couple are ‘modern’, which means they believe that in marriage, love should come first and practical considerations second. They’ve gone to Gretna Green, a village just inside Scotland, to escape English law &#8211; and are exemplars of the new philosophy of Romanticism, which privileges feeling over reason and impulse over tradition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/handfasting-wedding-traditions.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6642" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/handfasting-wedding-traditions.jpg?resize=635%2C629" alt="handfasting-wedding-traditions" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romanticism transforms love. The old system of marrying for political or economic advantage slowly crumbles around the world. The village of Gretna Green becomes synonymous with illicit marriages, and John and Harriet are among hundreds of English couples in the late 18th and 19th centuries who elope there. The public appetite for stories of romantic dissent is such that the local priest publishes some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>bestselling memoirs of his time there, full of daring coach-rides across the border, and the wrath of unconsulted fathers who reach the runaway children too late.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Gretna Green becomes an important place because there is a growing belief that marriage should be the consequence of love. And that if two people love each other that alone is what matters. Income, the standing of the wider family, career and how the parents-in-law might get on seems irrelevant. And more than that: they begin to be cast not as wise, serious matters which really ought to be taken into account, but as things that could only seem relevant to gouty fathers, snobbish aunts and dried up conventional people with no care for the happiness of a couple. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mostly, when we want to do something we take advice if we can from people who have done it before. Gretna Green stands for a remarkable shift in thinking, around relationships, which is powerful today: the assumption that people who have already had marriages are likely to be very poor advisors and guides to the young. Love is understood to be an enthusiasm, not a skill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">London, England, 1813</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Readers of Jane Austen’s latest novel are on the edge of their seats as Fitzwilliam Darcy stumbles his way through a proposal to Elizabeth Bennet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">His offer of marriage promises to fix all her problems: not only is he handsome, but he is rich – and Elizabeth’s family, with four unmarried daughters to support, needs all the cash they can get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Elizabeth says no. Darcy, for all his gifts, is also arrogant and a snob. <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> may suggest women marry for money, but Elizabeth’s actions reveal a new and subversive belief rapidly gaining currency in English society: that they should love the man they marry too. It is an idea Austen supports strongly. Eleven years earlier, she had herself rejected a proposal of marriage, claiming “anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without affection”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/779px-Thomson-PP14-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6644" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/779px-Thomson-PP14-1.jpg?resize=635%2C599" alt="779px-Thomson-PP14 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In her greatest novel, however, things turn out for the best. Eventually, after many twists and turns, and despite her lack of standing and money, Elizabeth and Darcy marry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What continues to strike readers today is that Jane Austen is deeply concerned about romance and about money. To marry only for money is, she argues, a disaster. But equally she holds that to marry only for love is terrible folly too. In her eyes a good marriage requires warmth and tenderness of heart and a strong practical, worldly, managerial competence. And from this, she draws the conclusion that few people are actually well-suited for marriage. She is unsurprised that many marriages are a little hollow or a little grim. Her novels depict numerous unsatisfactory relationships and a very few happy ones. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the early years of the 19th century, Jane Austen is defining the wise ideal of modern love. She sees marriage as a hybrid enterprise: in some respects it is like running a small business, or organising a village fete. If you don’t keep track of the practical details and don’t have quite an efficient turn for administration, things will go badly wrong. But at the same time, marriage is a profoundly complex emotional encounter. And to thrive in it one needs emotional maturity, affection, playfulness and warmth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through her novels she is trying to present the reader with an education. In a truly classical way, she believes we can do few things well if we leave our performance to nature, luck and chance. A happy relationship depends on the maturity of both parties. In <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>, both Elizabeth Bennet<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and Darcy have to be improved &#8211; he has to lose his pride and she has to shed her prejudice &#8211; if they are to be capable of living well together. Love is something we need to learn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">London 24 November 1859 </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the day Darwin publishes<em> The Origin of Species</em>. There is a huge initial resistance. But eventually much of the world is convinced by his arguments. Human beings are descended from the primates. And that means that we have inherited not just their skeletal structure but also a lot of their drives and basic psychology. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_1871.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6638" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_1871.jpg?resize=635%2C629" alt="669px-Editorial_cartoon_depicting_Charles_Darwin_as_an_ape_(1871)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Darwin’s detractors are aghast at the implied humiliation. But there’s consolation in Darwin too, because he suggests that our inability to live up to our ideals is not wholly our own fault. We are, at any time, half apes. And for apes to aim for faithful, life-long, passionate, egalitarian relationships is to attempt to pull off something hugely difficult starting from a very unpromising base. No wonder we often fail.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6639" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image01.png?resize=635%2C559" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without particularly intending to, Darwin ushers in a strategic and useful pessimism about relationships. Rather than being, for instance, essentially monogamous, he implies that human beings might &#8211; by nature at least &#8211; be predisposed to (as many apes are) to polygamy, opportunistic sex and the dumping of one mate for another on the basis of nothing more than their breeding potential, signalled by such unedifying and unspiritual characteristics as how big their breasts are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Aquatic Park, San Francisco, United States, August 1965</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jefferson Poland, wearing a flower behind his ear, strips off his swimming trunks and wades naked into the sea. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Poland is one of the first hippies. He wears his hair long and rejects the sophistication of modern life for a romantic notion of getting back to a natural state of grace. Behind him and three other protesters braving the icy cold ocean water is a cheering crowd of beatniks and anarchists, who hold up signs and chant the phrase “Sex is clean! Law is obscene!” in front of a hastily assembled group of reporters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flower_Power_demonstrator.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6655" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flower_Power_demonstrator.jpg?resize=635%2C407" alt="Flower_Power_demonstrator" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This event is one of many organised by groups advocating free love in the 1960s in America. They argue that society’s rules against nudity, same-sex relationships and sex before marriage are all forms of sexual repression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Soon monogamy itself is being questioned; in an enlightened world, they argue, sexually liberated men and women should give up marriage, along with it, jealousy, adultery and divorce. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a beautiful, deeply Romantic idea of what love could be &#8211; which eventually collapses into disaster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Belgium, 2015</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The country achieves a notorious distinction. It is the nation with the highest rate of divorce in the developed world, an astonishing 71% of couples split up. A newspaper in the country asks why, and the answer comes back clearly: initial expectations were not met.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6648" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b.jpg?resize=635%2C566" alt="2291217028_7bc41c0cb0_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Other countries are not far behind. In the UK, the divorce rate is 42%, in the US, 53%, in Hungary 67% and in Portugal 68%.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the reason lies in the disappointment people feel with what had apparently been promised to them by the free-loving 1960s, and before that, by 19th-century Romanticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream of love survives, but it disappoints constantly. At dinner tables around the world, otherwise intelligent people complain that they simply cannot understand the strange and tricky subject of love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The future hope for love lies in the notion of sacrifice: that is, in accepting that we won’t get everything we want from love, relationships or marriage. We’re trying to do something highly ambitious in our modern ideals of relationships: unite sex, affection, the raising of a family, a career and adequate material security. We will, by necessity, fail to get all of these.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/728px-1491_Henry_VIII.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6647" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/728px-1491_Henry_VIII.jpg?resize=635%2C585" alt="728px-1491_Henry_VIII" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of sacrifice, though, helps us if we consider that getting half of what we really want and need might still be quite a lot &#8211; in comparison with what it would be like if we avoided relationships altogether. Clearly a solitary life can work really well for a few people, but mostly we hate living alone. The question should not be so much whether relationships live up to our ideal hopes of mutual happiness but whether they are better (if only a little) than not having relationships at all. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The future of love needs us to get interested in ambivalence: that is, in the capacity to keep on thinking that something is quite good even while we are painfully conscious of its many and striking day-to-day imperfections.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It sounds paradoxical to talk of the<em> problems</em> of being beautiful, when we’re so alive to all the advantages that go with possessing sculpted cheekbones, copious amounts of hair, an ideal nose, long, slender legs and well-moulded ankles.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the subject is necessary and legitimate, because beauty is not in fact problem-free. There are a range of ailments (too little discussed) that go with being extremely beautiful. Here are seven of the greatest:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: You are boring </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not absolutely always, of course. No one is. But the temptation to be boring is great – and it’s not your fault at all. It’s just that, since you were 12, there has always been a party that people were begging you to go to. You’ve almost never had to begin a conversation. Others have always been on hand to entertain you. You’ve not had much chance just to be on your own, with nothing much to do other than fall back on an exploration of your own psyche. You’ve never known the fruitful ravages of self-hatred. There has been no need to charm others with words – and no pressure to overcome their scepticism with humour or acute observations. Indeed, you’ve often wanted to put people off. Being a bit boring has in fact been a survival strategy. It is the only way to stop people pestering you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451570210.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5860" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451570210.jpg?resize=635%2C429" alt="The Serpentine Gallery Summer Party - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: You intimidate the ugly </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not deliberately at all. In fact, it’s horrible to discover that really nice people who don’t look very nice (the majority of humanity) are terrified of approaching you. It’s a weird thing to find you have this effect. You’d really like that quiet person in the corner to dare to come and say hi: they’re kind, good natured and (when they finally relax) very funny – but they know they look a bit of a frump and don’t want to be reminded of the fact by standing near you. In a different life you could be great friends, even lovers. Just not in this one. They freeze when they catch sight of your radiant eyes, perfect profile and incredibly elegant hands. Even if it’s not quite what you want, the people it’s easiest to pair up with are other beautiful types. No wonder your relationships can be very dull indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4944696111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5865" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4944696111.jpg?resize=635%2C494" alt="RCA Graduate Fashion Show Gala Reception" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: You miss out on some usefully difficult experiences</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anyone would be thrilled to be your lover. You’ve not been single for longer than a few months ever. In your adult life, you’ve not faced rejection in any serious way. Who could ever take their leave? Yet, weirdly, it’s often through difficult experiences that we grow to maturity. They’re painful, but necessary. They force us to develop compensating resources: we become stronger, more resilient; we learn compassion; we get more appreciative of small things. It’s not your fault, but you’ve been a little spoilt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451546188.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5858" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_451546188.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="Johnnie Walker Blue Label Announces Collaboration With Jude Law With Stills From 'The Gentleman's Wager' Film" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Relationships are more difficult </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In bed, you’re always wondering: ‘is it me or is it my body they want?’ You want to be loved for the whole of who you are. But your exterior is so fantastic, it overshadows anything else; people just can’t ignore it. You want to be appreciated for your take on the French novel, your loyalty to your troubled sister, your views on the future of the left. But even when people say the right things, the fears won’t go away. They make too much sense.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4886844451.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5866" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_4886844451.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="&quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; Press Conference" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: People assume you are stupid</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They don’t wait to find out. Their imaginations simply refuse to picture you carefully unpicking a page of Hegel or analysing the state of the Swedish economy. They like the idea of you being a bit dim. There seems to be a prejudice against combining outstanding qualities: you just can’t be that beautiful and understand nuclear physics. That would be too much good fortune ending up in the one place. Everyone insists you can’t be very intelligent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154538116.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5856" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154538116.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Robert Pattinson Sydney Photocall" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: No one imagines you have any problems</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortune – people feel – has smiled on you already. You can’t need anything. Your are a magnet for envy: a fair few people<em> like</em> finding fault with you. They feel that you need to be shown you are nothing special (though you never claimed to be). They are using you to vent their frustrations with life in general. You’re fair game – you are too beautiful, they think, ever to be hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_1415640301.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5850" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_1415640301.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Sean Connery, In The Role Of James Bond, Receives A Massage From Jeanne Roland In 'You Only Live Twice'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Ageing is worse</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have this rare thing: your body is ideal. <em>For now</em>. That’s why getting older terrifies you a lot. (Yesterday you found another wrinkle. Your left knee twinges when you climb the stairs). You have so much to lose. You’ll look in the mirror and foresee a wreck. From being so high, the fall will be harder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_71495575.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5862" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_71495575.jpg?resize=635%2C541" alt="Joan Collins" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately, the problems of the very beautiful are transient. Thankfully, no one stays long at the peak of loveliness. Time will take your troubles away. In a few years, almost certainly, your looks will have lost their uncanny perfection; your physique will shed its grace. You will be nice enough looking, but you will no longer be one of the outstandingly attractive ones – and you will no longer share in their unique, but very real and very under-appreciated, problems. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Generally, we see other people&#8217;s relationships from the outside. We see couples walking comfortably around the market buying apples or bantering at a drinks party. We hardly ever get to see what they are like together in their trickier moments, what goes on when they get very upset.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By total contrast, we know our own relationships from the inside. We&#8217;re acutely aware of our own times of rage, bitterness or sullen silence. We know so well the intense frustration that builds around tiny things; the ways we hurt one another – not always entirely unintentionally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference between these perspectives makes for a damaging distortion. Our sense of what a &#8216;good enough&#8217; relationship looks like is unfairly biased. We need to help ourselves by having a more accurate, informed picture of normal relationships. In an abstract, light way we know that all couples have their troubles, but we need to see them for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pretty high level of conflict, meanness, folly and disappointment are standard. They are part and parcel of good enough relationships. A good relationship isn&#8217;t one in which the couple get along well most of the time. It&#8217;s one in which they&#8217;ve learned to accept that appalling difficulties and frustrations are normal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That this piece of knowledge is not yet very widespread explains the ongoing high incidence of divorce. We are not only unhappy; fatefully, we believe that our unhappiness is anomalous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and a sign of error. We therefore escape our perceived &#8216;unnecessary&#8217; troubles by leaving one relationship and starting another and consequently end up with a different but equally intense set of sorrows (and plenty of casualties along the way).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This opens up a vital function for art: to correct the optimistic talk that we sentimentally hear all the time in order to show us that what we had thought of as a private agony, in fact, belongs to the realm of the normal – and is part of a sane person&#8217;s duty to endure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art should function as a private repository for truths that are too peculiar and too unacceptable to be shared with people we know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This explains the value and importance of the work of the Canadian photographer Chloë Ellingson. She has travelled around Toronto interviewing a succession of couples about the challenges that they face in their relationships. We don’t necessarily have their problems, but we have comparable ones and more. It’s not ‘schadenfreude’ to want to listen in; it’s something far more humane and vulnerable: a desire to know we are not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ellingson taps into one of art’s central functions: to hold up a mirror to our darker, more private and trickier sides, in order to heal and reassure us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">John, 31, and Zack, 31</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John_Zack.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5325" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John_Zack.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="John_Zack" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zack finds John’s communication style abrasive at times. “John can be very mean sometimes, and I’m a delicate petal in my own mind,” he says. If something is bothering Zack, John’s reaction is to look for a solution, regardless of whether or not that is what John actually wants at the time. “My mantra in life has always been ‘If it feels good, do it, if it feels bad then fix it’,” says John. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John and Zack also experience tension in regards to physical affection. “Right now Zack and I are in different places as far as intimacy,” John says. “We want intimacy at different times, different intensities, everything from cuddling to sex, we want at different times, and so the result is that we’ve fallen out of sync.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Adam, 33, and Katie, 29</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Katie_Adam.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5326" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Katie_Adam.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Katie_Adam" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Katie and Adam differ in how they value productivity. “I am go go go, and Adam is laissez-faire,” says Katie, “and that drives me bonkers sometimes.” Adam says he looks at Katie as a “beacon of productivity,” but worries about how this difference will play out in the future. “What sits in the background that worries me is that this will become a larger issue at some point in our relationship and it will grind at her. There’s a fear in me that my shortcomings will eventually drive Kate either away from me or just to the point of absolute frustration.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gabby, 65, and Tim, 58</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gabby_Tim.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5323" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gabby_Tim.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Gabby_Tim" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Gabby and Tim differ in how they address conflict. Tim says an openness to conflict was not part of his upbringing, and arguing is not something he enjoys. Gabby takes the opposite view. “I’m like a volcano. I erupt,” she says. “And when I erupt I want to immediately deal with the situation, and Tim is the ostrich with his head in the sand and just decides that it’s not worth it, so he will not respond to my outbursts. It’s like adding gasoline to a fire. I just want to fight so badly, and it always happens before we go to bed, and so I’m nattering at him and he’s literally not at all responding to the point where he rolls over and he starts to fall asleep.”</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Kerry, 40, and Brandy, 38</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kerry_Brandy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5327" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kerry_Brandy.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Kerry_Brandy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kerry feels that Brandy projects vulnerabilities from other areas of life onto their relationship. “The fault line extends into our relationship in ways it doesn’t have to,” says Kerry, who says that after the couple has a conversation about the relationship, Brandy will realise the anxiety might actually come from work, or her relationship with her mother. “One of our newest points of tension is me feeling I have to be the superego all the time,” Brandy says. Kerry will propose fun, romantic and impulsive ideas of things to do instead of following through with responsibilities the couple has, and this puts Brandy in the position of disciplinarian. “I’m the one who always has to say “no,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Leah, 31, and Chris, 29</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leah_Chris.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5328" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leah_Chris.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Leah_Chris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chris says he finds Leah’s aversion to conflict problematic. When Leah avoids confrontation, Chris doesn’t know what she wants. “How I react to that is normally I’ll get more insular and I’ll spend as little as five minutes and as much as half a day in a zone coming up with my own narrative, or focusing on why this is becoming a bigger deal than it’s supposed to be,” says Chris. Leah’s discomfort with confrontation is problematic because it fuels Chris’s own insecurities and difficulties with trust. “Chris has been with someone who was unfaithful to him, and that’s a difficult way to end a relationship” Leah says. “Obviously it leads to some residual feelings of mistrust.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Leda, 85, and Ross, 85</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leda_Ross.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5330" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leda_Ross.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Leda_Ross" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ross says Leda is a “free spirit,” while he likes to follow a schedule and plan ahead. Leda says Ross’s approach to life is much more “straight-lined” than hers. “It permeates everything,” she says, especially regarding work on shared projects. “When we’re working together we’re not thinking in the same language,” says Leda.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For years, you felt burdened with thoughts, feelings and opinions that didn’t seem to make much sense to anyone else. You sometimes wondered if you were going mad. There were people you didn’t like, but everyone else seemed to think they were terrific and so you held your tongue. You got anxious and uncomfortable on social occasions when everyone else seemed happy and relaxed. There were things you would have quite liked to try in bed, but they felt shameful and you would not have dared to mention them even to your best friend. You learnt to keep secrets in order to be liked.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then finally, you met a very special person. What made them so special was that, at long last, you no longer had to dissemble around them. You could admit to important truths. You could confess, and be rewarded for sharing, your deepest self. It was a favourite game in those early months. You pushed yourself to go as far as you could go. The deeper the secret, the better. No area of the self seemed beyond investigation, no secret too shocking or explicit. You could explain that you found a mutual acquaintance arrogant, narcissistic and mean. Or that you thought some supposed ‘masterpiece’ of a book very boring. You could explain that you liked pulling hair during sex or had always been excited by ropes. Love seemed to be born out of this new possibility for honesty. What had previously been taboo gave way to exhilarating intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7289983774_432bf0b7de_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7852" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/7289983774_432bf0b7de_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="7289983774_432bf0b7de_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The relief and excitement at unburdening ourselves of all the secrets that life in society demands is at the heart of the feeling of being in love. It is almost as if being in love is the ability to show someone who we really are. This sense of mutual conspiracy underlies the touch of pity that every new couple feels for the rest of humanity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this sharing of secrets sets up in our minds – and in our collective culture – a powerful and potentially problematic ideal: that if two people love one another, then they must always tell each other the truth about everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4470" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait1.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="735px-Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_painted_portrait" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">In his Confessions, the French writer Jean Jacques Rousseau argued that we owe it to one another to be completely honest about our experiences. It’s a sign of corruption to put up facades. Real people are direct, they can own up to who they really are. Even if Rousseau didn’t quite live up to this ideal himself, he presented it so eloquently and seductively that it has become common sense. The idea continues to be an influence on your relationship to this day.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, inevitably, there came a moment of crisis. Perhaps you were in a restaurant, sitting with your lover, the beloved person who had joined you in your innermost convictions about the right way to cook pasta, the nicest places to visit in Italy, the best way to perform cunnilingus and the merits of Salman Rushdie’s novels. And now with equal confidence and trust – in the spirit of having no more secrets – you mentioned that you were a little turned on by the fascinating character reading a book in a corner table on their own. But, on this occasion, there was no more conspiratorial smile and shy but decisive agreement. There was no eager leaning forward, no whispered corroboration. Just a slightly pained, quizzical look from the partner, the trusted recipient of every secret to date. Perhaps it wasn’t even around sex. Maybe on a Sunday morning, you were reading a review of a new biography of Margaret Thatcher, and the left-wing critic’s words struck you as a little harsh and you said so, but at once you got the sense that this was a topic on which no quarter could be given. Even a trace of sympathy for the former British Prime Minister was simply an impossibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are up against a fundamental conflict within the modern understanding of love. Keeping secrets seems like a betrayal of the relationship. At the same time, the complete truth would appear to place the union in mortal danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"> <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/16660433558_c413bb13c1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7853" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/16660433558_c413bb13c1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="16660433558_c413bb13c1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Jake Stimptson</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of honesty is sublime. It presents a deeply moving vision of how two people can be together and it is a constant presence in the early months. But there is a problem: we keep wanting to make this same demand as the relationship goes on. And yet in order to be kind, and in order to sustain the relationship, it ultimately becomes necessary to keep a great many thoughts out of sight. We are perhaps too conscious of the bad reasons for hiding something; we haven’t paid enough attention to the noble reasons why, from time to time, true loyalty may lead one to say very much less than the whole truth. We are so impressed by honesty, we have forgotten the virtues of politeness, this word defined not as a cynical withholding of important information for the sake of harm, but as a dedication to not rubbing someone up against the true, hurtful aspects of one’s nature. It is ultimately no great sign of kindness to insist on showing someone one’s entire self at all times. Repression, a certain degree of restraint and a dedication to editing one’s pronouncements belongs to love as much as a capacity for explicit confession. The person who cannot tolerate secrets, who in the name of ‘being honest’, shares information so wounding it cannot be forgotten, is no friend of love. Just as no parent tells a child the whole truth, so we should accept the ongoing need to edit our full reality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And if one suspects (and one should, rather regularly, if the relationship is a good one) that one’s partner might be lying too (about what they are thinking about, about how they judge one’s work, about where they were last night…), it is perhaps best not to take up arms and lay into them like a sharp relentless inquisitor, however intensely one yearns to do just that. It may be kinder, wiser and perhaps more in the true spirit of love, to pretend one simply didn’t notice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche187c1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4473" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Nietzsche187c1.jpg?resize=635%2C531" alt="Nietzsche" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Friedrich Nietzsche departed from philosophical wisdom as it had been defined hitherto by insisting that the truth is not always the most important thing for us to be concerned with. What matters is what we are able to do with what we know: one can use the truth to damage someone, or one can use it to help. This should determine the degree of our dedication to it. We don’t have to tell each other the truth all the time unless it genuinely helps us to accomplish our goals. In Nietzsche’s words, often it really does not: ‘We need art’ (that is, strategic deceptions) ‘lest we die of the truth.’</span></em></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The English psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott developed the idea of a Transitional Object. He wanted to draw attention to the very important work done by children’s much-loved teddy bears. At first a baby feels fused with the mother. But gradually a child will become independent, able to live successfully alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How does one manage this transition? A teddy bear can help by being a bit like the mother – a source of tenderness and sweetness and comfort. And yet, it is really the child who gives the bear these qualities. So the bear is a lovely thing: a halfway house, a resting place between the utter dependency of the baby and the emotional independence of the adult. But we don’t ever entirely resolve this problem. We are always, to some extent, in transition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we recognise that the demands of independence are getting a bit too much – when we’ve had to be too adult, too sensible, too reliable for too long – we need to let ourselves be dependent and insecure. This transitional object is named Donald in honour of Mr Winnicott, the first person to think with appropriate depth about the value such a creature might have for us. He was created in collaboration with designer Donna Wilson by a team at The School of Life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It could seem like a strange topic to be discussing. It doesn&#8217;t come up much in polite company.</p>
<p>Yet we know that as many as 35 per cent of US and UK males under 50 will be struggling with it to a degree they themselves find somewhat dispiriting in reflexive moments. In its most extreme form, using up hour after hour, it starts to sap relationships, motivation and sheer well-being.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/21157660909_2dc86c5346_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9820" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/21157660909_2dc86c5346_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="21157660909_2dc86c5346_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The first move is to insist that the problem is neither ridiculous nor unfathomable. It starts with a simple design flaw in our brains: brains that evolved to respond powerfully to stimuli &#8211; like sexual attraction or sugar &#8211; in conditions where these were very scarce indeed.</p>
<p>These brains just never acquired a capacity for self-control commensurate with the temptations offered by the modern, technologically enhanced world. Levels of discipline that were at one point entirely adequate to deal with sexual opportunities in the small villages of the East African grasslands just can’t cope with galleries filled with images of millions of highly fertile well-proportioned digitised naked people. Why ever do anything other than look?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9861" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health.jpg?resize=621%2C466" alt="porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The problem we have around porn is identical to that we can develop around food: brains that were geared to take quick advantage of the occasional presence of something pleasurable are now defenceless before the boundless artificial sweeteners turned out by our remorseless technologies.</p>
<p>People don’t spend hours looking at pornography on the screen because they are ‘bad’, but because the porn is so very ‘good’, that is devilishly well-adapted to breaking down all arguments against it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14700571442_634f49094a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9822" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14700571442_634f49094a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="14700571442_634f49094a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Crucially &#8211; in all cases of addiction, it&#8217;s never that we are simply greedy or lusty or depraved&#8230;</p>
<p>The real reason is always more poignant and more worthy of sympathy: we get addicted because we&#8217;re sad.</p>
<p>The business of living is so desperately hard, relationships are so challenging, work often so unfulfilling or boring, family dynamics so tricky and the capacity for honest, kindly conversation so restricted, we may through no particular fault of our own fall into despondency &#8211; of a kind that leaves us extremely vulnerable to the sudden intense highs offered by short films about lesbians trying anal &#8211; or plate after plate of iced buns.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9823" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o.jpg?resize=635%2C456" alt="3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>What we call addiction invariably has the same structure: a difficult life + a very intense diversionary pleasure + a technologically-induced way of increasing that pleasure to a pitch which breaks our mind&#8217;s natural muscles of self control. The cause of porn addiction isn&#8217;t, therefore, porn: it&#8217;s careers that are fraught and relationships where we can&#8217;t get our point across and essays that are devilishly tricky to author.</p>
<p>The real cure to addiction is hence simple in structure: to find something nicer to pursue than the thing we&#8217;re addicted to.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/bakinglady.webs.com/DSCF7068.JPG?resize=535%2C401" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, that&#8217;s going to be very hard, for comparable highs are not widely to hand. Yet, a chief immediate enemy is shame, which reinforces the feeling of low-self worth that helps inspire the addiction in the first place. It’s therefore helpful to insist on a few points:</p>
<p>&#8211; that addiction is normal</p>
<p>&#8211; that it&#8217;s not our fault: it&#8217;s that of a brain that wasn&#8217;t made to cope with the temptations before us.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9824" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o-1.jpg?resize=450%2C456" alt="6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&#8211; that there&#8217;s no need for self-disgust: the addicted are almost in the majority, though we&#8217;d never know it.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should draw courage from the confessions of others.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should acknowledge the sadness in our lives.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should interpret it with the necessary dignity; holding the pain and incompleteness in mind without fleeing it.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should use it to power something more relevant to our talents. Reroot the manic energy. Try to heal someone else&#8217;s pain, swap this addiction for another slightly less fruitless one: become compulsive elsewhere.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9825" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And then, a banal but critical point: we should try never to be left alone with the computer when we are in a vulnerable state. Let the rational parts of us structure life so that we will be less at risk in moments of sadness.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>It is simply the ultimate cruel tease that the machine we have to do all our work on also happens to host the magic door to a play land more phantasmagorical than anything the Marquis de Sade could have dreamt up.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Juliette_Sade_Dutch1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9828" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Juliette_Sade_Dutch1.jpg?resize=450%2C666" alt="Juliette_Sade_Dutch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secular modern people often automatically assume that sexuality can’t exert a momentous power over our minds. They’re being too sanguine, and therefore unwittingly rather mean. Online porn has an unparalleled power to get in the way of almost every other rather important and precious thing around – starting with the rest of our lives.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should forgive ourselves for being so drawn to these intense often rather harmful highs in a world that is mostly grey and arduous. But then, with all the will we can muster, we should try very hard to switch off.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The online world is flooded with every conceivable kind of sexual image. A substantial percentage of all internet searches (perhaps as high as 30%) are for pornographic material. Even its detractors have to concede that, by the standards of sheer volume at least, the porn industry seems to be hugely successful. It appears to have tapped into a core demand of humanity, however awkward it might at times feel to admit this.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But seen another way, porn is a major collective failure. Not because it exists at all. But for another reason, that initially sounds very strange: the porn industry fails us because it doesn’t produce <em>good porn</em>. The idea of <em>good porn</em> can seem paradoxical. Many people worry that porn itself is bad – it has surely ruined so many lives, it is an issue of grim conflict in millions of marriages; parents are terrified of their children’s online exposure.</span></p>

</p>
<p class="p1">When people eat badly, we don’t try to stop them eating at all. We hope to improve their diet. The aim isn’t to abolish food, just because some food is terrible. We want good food to be more widely and easily available. The same move could apply to online sex sites. We can’t abolish porn. So the goal is to get good pornography. Better porn isn’t stuff that’s even more thrilling or exciting. It is ‘better’ in the sense of being better for us – less at odds with the rest of our lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that porn could, under the right circumstances, actually be beneficial, strikes many people as very strange. But it shouldn’t. Looking at a lot of porn tends to leave us feeling disconnected and hollow. That’s because it doesn’t seem connected to anything else we value in the rest of our lives. It’s merely about sex, rather than being also about other things we care about: like self-understanding, kindness, intelligence and good relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of harnessing sexual energy to the service of higher ideals has not always seemed strange. The Catholic Church, for instance, took very seriously the idea that they might, in their art, place some  important ideas (about the meaning of life) next to some distinctly attractive people. Sex was invited to lend glamour and energy to philosophy.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise ambition of the Catholic church is to get our erotic appetites to work in the same direction as our better nature, instead of in opposition – which is so often and painfully the case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to accept that there’s always going to be a lot porn. The challenge is to start to make it better. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER PORN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Change the porn stars</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-120314-pornB111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5907" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-120314-pornB111.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="PM-120314-pornB11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ancient Greeks were into statue porn. In this one they have taken a lot of trouble to get the forward thrust of the hip just right; the pose of the raised arm is very suggestive. They were hoping you’d be turned on. But he’s also the god Apollo: the representative of wisdom and skill. He’s going to be really dirty in bed, but he’s got a lot of other things going on too. The statue of Apollo gives greater prestige to a very important ideal. It pictures someone very successful, very admirable and competent – who is also highly sensuous. This ideal was meant to be in people’s minds as they grew up, as they judged themselves and others. The Greeks were presenting Apollo as someone who could combine being sexual with being clever and accomplished. And they were saying to themselves and posterity: ‘Maybe you should be a bit like this too.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have – unfortunately – left porn largely in the hands of people who don’t seem to be much interested in anything apart from sex. To put it more bluntly, the people portrayed in porn often inhibit identification. They don’t look like your friends, or the people who work in the firm you’re hoping to join, or those you’d find it interesting to meet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/137580810.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5908" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/137580810.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="Adult Video News Awards At The Hard Rock - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Novels really took off in the 19th century when writers started to get interested in realism. The story might be about things you’d never yourself actually do in real life; like walk from London to Brighton, as in Dickens’ <em>Oliver Twist</em> (1838) or manage a failing paper manufacturing company as in Balzac’s <em>Lost Illusions</em> (1843). But it was possible to feel close to these characters, to share their ambitions and fears and to learn from their experience.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/180255988.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5909" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/180255988.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="Oliver!" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This wise development hasn’t yet happened with pornography. The porn of the utopian society would allow us to identify properly with the people involved, and to care a little about them, even if we meet them for only three minutes or in one still image.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might, for example, meet a master’s student in finance who spends an afternoon with two men. In her mind, there’s a battle between a sense of guilt and a craving for exploration (she is especially excited by being shouted at); she doesn’t tell her boyfriend. Or, we might meet a polite chemical engineer who wants to dominate someone, but despairs of getting this to happen in his life. Eventually, he learns to cast off politeness and reconnect with his own ruthlessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we’ve learned from advertising, the psychological context can be made palpable very quickly. It’s not impossible; it just takes a lot of skill, a quality as yet deeply lacking in the manufacture of porn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.jessicatoddharper.com/data/photos/32_1r17pittsburgh.jpg?resize=616%2C493" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Get a better ‘frame’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Almost every porn website in the world is in bad taste. The colours clash, the language is aggressive, the site is jumbled and chaotic. This isn’t a minor point. The French publishing house Gallimard takes immense trouble with its book jackets, because it knows that the experience of a book doesn’t begin with just the words themselves. The &#8216;wrapping&#8217; too is a communicative medium that should have to all the dignity of the content.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456903404.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5912" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456903404.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="GERMANY-NOBEL-PRIZE-LITERATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same principle should hold true with a porn site. Its design should communicate soberness, goodwill, intelligence and calm.</span></p>
<p class="p1">T<strong>hree: Change the categories of what turns us on</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porn pays great attention to externals: high heels, canes, skin colour, the size of body parts. But the underlying cause of much of our excitement is really very different. It is overwhelmingly psychological. We are excited by ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, porn sites tend to divide up their material according to some pretty basic categories: AMATEUR, LARGE BREASTS, LEATHER and so on. Utopian porn would cast these aside in order to arrange the material according to the psychological triggers of excitement. We identify at least five major ones, around which the porn of the future should be classified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">i) Loneliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This category would feature lonely or isolated individuals who we see overcoming shyness, reserve, and alienation in order – finally – to express their sexuality, in a way that encourages us to feel more comfortable with our own desires. Scientific researchers, librarians, civil servants and modest quiet individuals (rarely seen in porn to date) would feature heavily in this category. We would witness them journeying from reserve and innocence to full displays of sexuality. The pleasure of watching them would stem from a welcome sense that our own libido, also often repressed and the subject of guilt, could in turn be liberated and accepted by others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Librarian_working_at_the_Pointe_Coupee_Parish_Parish_library_in_New_Roads_Louisiana_in_1936.jpg?resize=535%2C419" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sexual excitement might sometimes appear to be a merely physiological phenomenon, the result of hormones and stimulated nerve endings. But in truth it arises as much from an idea as from a sensation: and it is in large part about the idea of acceptance, and of the promise of an end to shame.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5936" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue.jpg?resize=560%2C402" alt="Blue" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">At the core of certain kinds of arousal is a form of emotional reassurance and relief, a sense of freedom that we have been allowed finally to reveal our arduously defended secret selves.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ii) Authority</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life generally demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. But in private, we go through life often thinking that we know what’s good for another person or feeling that someone deserves some rather harsh treatment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In our hearts, we might like to be very bossy, very demanding and insistent. We would like to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But of course, in the real world, this is made difficult by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status which would allow us to exercise power as we would want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://sierraslilcorner.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/couple-bdsm-couples-pet-submissive-slave-bound-bondage-favorites-fred_large.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="530" /></p>
<p class="p1">So a major porn category is one which allows to fantasise about exercising authority. In sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen; and we can  be as bossy as we like. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of how and when to exercise decisive power over another person. And yet in the porn scenario, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety – because one might be mistaken about another’s wishes, because there might be resentment and one might hurt someone – the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one is left bereft by the violence. The other person accepts one’s violent, extreme possibilities. They aren&#8217;t shocked. Afterwards, there may be love and cosiness, until next time. It is the fantasy that violence is no longer bad for us and others; that anger and aggression can be expended safely, will not make others unhappy, but in fact will be welcomed by them – and that the fury of another will not wreck our lives but, in fact, bring us a kindly thrill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">iii) Passivity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are taught from a young age that we must become independent and strong. We live in an individualistic culture that constantly vilifies dependence and pushes us towards an ideal of solitary maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it seems, in our sexual selves, many of us are deeply turned on by the idea of thorough passivity and submission, as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won’t have our best interests at heart. They won’t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the deep hope in the erotic scenario in utopian porn would be that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion: we witness the best form of passivity at the hands of an ideally authoritarian person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5915" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder.jpg?resize=635%2C676" alt="A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>&#8216;Now you can do anything to me. I mean it. Anything.&#8217;</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kinkiness collects around things that trouble us. Erotic fantasies are imagined ideal solutions to real-world anxieties. Porn has the opportunity to target our problems and minister to them. Rightly used, porn isn’t a distraction. It feeds good moves to the imagination. It has a role to play in our emotional education. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">iv) Seriousness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be extremely exciting when a normally very serious, responsible person reveals a kinkier, more erotic side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why glasses can, for example, be so sexy. Glasses are symbols of thoughtfulness and gravity. They’re worn by people who seem to have a lot on their plate and perhaps a lot of significant thoughts in their minds. The worry is whether these sort of people have any time for us. They may be too important to pay us and our desires much attention. But when glasses are invited into sex, a natural – and important – anxiety is being addressed and (temporarily) resolved: the worry that thoughtfulness and seriousness on the one hand, and bodily excitement on the other might be incompatible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The imagined solution is that the person in glasses can turn out to be not only thoughtful but also extremely interested in sex and the body. Sex with glasses symbolises that the life of the mind is not separate from that of sensual pleasure, that sensitivity and seriousness can be properly reconciled with, and profoundly sympathetic to intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/80/58/7d/80587d4ceac136b502de63223e4ae004.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="540" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">v) Responsibility</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good porn has a therapeutic role. It ideally helps us integrate sexual longing with the rest of life. Consider a very caring mother in her early 40s, who has slightly lost interest in her husband, who in any case is preoccupied with work and tends to drink a bit in the evenings and isn’t often up to sex.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might need porn to reconnect her to an important, but currently neglected part of herself: more adventurous, less emotionally involved. She doesn’t need to get closer to people, she needs to feel that she doesn’t have to be responsible for everyone. She can be selfish for a minute and the world won’t fall apart. She’d say she’s not interested in porn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3755098i.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5933" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3755098i.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Boyhood - 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might need some pretty rough and anonymous porn. She doesn’t need to think of relationships. She needs to enjoy guilt-free orgasms and get back to her hectic, hugely important life a little more at ease with herself and the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something similar will be needed by a shy, over-sensitive man who should get a bit more independent and sure of himself. He needs to become more assertive. In adolescence, he became acutely aware of his own sexuality, but didn’t pick up very well on the sexual nature of other people: it seems to him that nice girls (the kind he’d otherwise like to be around) will be disgusted by the dirtier aspects of his own imagination. In conversation he’d of course say he understands perfectly well about women and sex. But in secret he doesn’t have faith.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He needs porn that can reassure him that the sort of women he meets (who are not remotely like porn stars are today) have just as kinky thoughts as he does. He’s got to really enter into their minds – and porn should help him do so. He should see people who have completely normal existences; only they are very generously sharing with him the details of their erotic longings.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                                      ***</p>
<p class="p1">We shouldn’t be negative about porn, just because of how most of it seems today. In 1800, many people offering medical services were quacks. They didn’t know what they were doing. There was a hunger for remedies – however misguided. So ‘being a doctor’ was nothing like the respectable career choice it is today. What changed was the realisation that we needed really serious, thoughtful and honourable people to go into this field. Health was too important to be left to self-appointed peddlers of fanciful potions. Right now, pornography is distracting, distorting and unhelpful. It takes up too much time and it leaves most people feeling ashamed. None of that is necessary. The solution isn’t to ban porn, but to make it better.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re hugely aware of the terrible things that can go wrong around porn in the age of the internet. But the longing for sexual stimulation isn’t going to go away. Given how vast the demand is, and how crucial the role of sexuality is in life, it is tragic that comparatively so little talent, wisdom, intelligence, maturity and aesthetic imagination has been direct to it. We’ve rightly come to fear bad porn, because it damages so many lives. Good porn could help us deal a little better with the complex, tricky fact of being – at the same time – highly sexual and highly reasonable beings.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the couple has been out all day: they’ve been to three meetings, grappled with a failing supplier, cleared up (hopefully) a misconception about tax rebates and sought to bring the new CEO on side with a scheme for a client conference that could have great consequences in Q3 (or could be a bit of a mess). They stood in the aisles of a crowded commuter train for an hour each way and then fought the local traffic back from the station. They were thinking about how great it would be finally to get home, pour a glass of wine, read the children a chapter of <em>The Famous Five</em>, kiss them goodnight, and sit down for a civilised meal and conversation with their most sympathetic ally, their spouse. They are currently, at the end of their tether and inclined to feel (justifiably) sorry for themselves.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/working-mum.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other member of the couple has been at home all day: once the children had been delivered to school (there was a bad fight in the car), they put away breakfast, made the beds, cleaned two bathrooms, vacuumed the house and sorted out the summer clothes. They organised for a plumber to come and look at the taps in the bathroom; they picked up the dry cleaning. They took a chair to be reupholstered, arranged a dental check up, did some food shopping, collected the children, prepared and gave them a (healthy) snack, cajoled them into doing their homework, prepared supper for them, ran them a bath and tidied a set of ink stains off the living room floor. Now they are thinking about how great it would be finally for their partner to come home and take over, so they can pour a glass of wine, read the children a chapter of <em>The Famous Five</em>, kiss them goodnight, and sit down for a civilised meal and conversation with their most sympathetic ally, their spouse. They are currently, at the end of their tether and inclined to feel (justifiably) sorry for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3287960.jpg" alt="Bedtime Story" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The result will be, predictably, an argument, or at least frayed tempers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Across the developed world, an outbreak of Resentment has broken out among couples.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a dominant feature of working couples with children in the modern age. They resent one another and feel aggrieved in themselves. Both parties are flat out all day; both are working incredibly hard at various things. But, crucially, neither feels particularly grateful for what the other does. The dominant emotion is resentment. It goes like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">One party feels:</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I earn most of the money and yet it’s seen as if I’m out having fun in the big wide world, being creative and fulfilled all the time, pursuing what seems to my partner to be a rather selfish ambition. In fact, my job is deeply stressful and only intermittently satisfying, it makes me very anxious and leaves me exhausted. My mind is on it all the time. If I slip up, it would be a disaster. When I get home, I really need to wind down. I just can’t be expected to take out the rubbish, iron the children’s pyjamas and be endlessly patient with them (and remember the names of all their teachers). In any case, I do my bit. I take them swimming on Saturday morning; I load the dishwasher after dinner. I’m more than helping out. Why don’t they stop going on at me and start appreciating the fact that I’m already contributing as much as I can? I’m furious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141565535.jpg" alt="Artists Ruth Roman, Glenn Ford" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><em>And the other party feels:</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am at home most of the day, and yet it’s seen as if I might be just relaxing, ‘not working’. Because I’m not bringing in the bulk of the money, it’s as if what I work at doesn’t count. When people ask what I do in my life, I often reply ‘nothing’. My work doesn’t seem to count at all. I feel my partner and the world at large just assume everything gets done by magic or even that I’m the ‘lucky’ one who gets to stay at home. But home is constant labour. Our family wouldn’t last five minutes unless I was at the wheel all day every day. And then when my partner does get home, finally (I feel they might often linger), I’m exhausted but they simply won’t recognise this; I’m desperate for a break, but they go on as if they are the only one in the world who could possibly be worn out – and they refuse to engage with the sort of domestic work that they should be doing 50% of, or at least some of! They just don’t appreciate me and what I do – and I’m furious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Where has this outbreak of Resentment come from? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To every couple, the resentment feels intensely personal. It is as though their spouse in particular is unreasonable, selfish, obtuse, ungrateful and mean. It’s a special and lamentable failing on the part of the person they were foolish enough to fall for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, the conflict is a general one. It has nothing to do with this or that person in the couple, though this is where the pain is registered. It is the consequence of an idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea was a deeply well-meaning and progressive one, which took hold in the mid-20th century and is now an almost universal law: the idea of equality in marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law states that: in a good, progressive relationship, tasks must be shared 50/50. This means that you both have to earn money (because this is, aside from a practical necessity, the sole route to freedom and fulfilment) and both of you have to take care of the housework and kids (because that’s a chore that it would be deeply unfair if one person had the sole or dominant share of).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law states that a good couple divides each task down the middle. Equal time on child care. Equal time preparing meals. Equal time on domestic administration. Equal time earning money. Equal time off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the law is nowhere enshrined in statute, it exists out there in the ether, as powerful and as normative as any real law could ever be, defining what is a good and a bad relationship, where a person deserves to be happy and where it is right to be resentful.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The idea of equality was designed to attack an unpardonable problem: that women were for centuries legally and practically denied the opportunity that men had to fulfil themselves through work outside the home and earn money and were forced instead to devote their lives solely to housework and childcare, which may not have suited them at all. Women were told that housework was an ideal target for their talents and paid work was ‘not for them’.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/housework.jpg" alt="Ironing women" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet many women found housework neither suited them temperamentally nor engaged with their real strengths or abilities. And it was to correct this wasteful and deeply frustrating system that the ideal of equality took hold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">In the process of getting the ideal to function, two shifts had to occur:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>1. A downgrading of domestic work:</strong> it had to be pointed out that looking after children and a home was not some blissful vocation. It could be a restriction on life’s real opportunities and wasn’t going to be able to offer a person a sufficient outlet for their talents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2. An upgrading of paid work:</strong> it had to be pointed out that paid work wasn’t just a chore, it was a route to fulfilment and self-creation, and that everyone should have a chance to sample it. Making money, probably in an office, became the essential prestigious activity across the developed world. In the process, work became seen as something one did for oneself, almost as a kind of pleasure, not a particular sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this was evidently not the intention, the ideal has opened up vast new areas for resentment. It is causing us real difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in practice very hard for everything to be split exactly 50/50. Someone is likely to be earning more money; someone is likely to be doing more of the housework – either by choice or by necessity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/iron.jpg" alt="Couple doing domestic chores" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And it is this unequal distribution (against an ideal of equality) that is causing couples across the developed world immense problems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person who is doing a bit or a lot more of the housework will feel unfulfilled because they are implicitly told by society that they are spending their time on something low-grade and demeaning. They know they will always be seen by society as second-class citizens, people who do not properly participate in, and contribute to, the adult world. They will not be encouraged to feel especially grateful to their partner for going out to work for money, because (so the story goes) paid work is a route to fulfilment and self-creation, something so wonderful it is close to a selfish activity, for which there is no need to say thank you. Therefore, far from gratitude, the person at home will have deep fears around any signs that their partner, when they return from having fun, is not doing ‘a fair share’ of the domestic chores – and they may resort to low-level criticism (and/or withholding sex) in an attempt to enforce the ideal of equality. Were it to come (which it usually won’t anyway), they probably won’t be interested in the partner’s praise because, according to the norms they have internalised, it’s demeaning to praise someone for doing a low status task. The person at home isn’t allowed, in themselves, to feel proud of having the curtains cleaned, baking bread or replacing the batteries for the smoke alarm. And they will feel awkward about expressing gratitude to their partner for going out into the world and making money. Because the aim is to be equal, the office-bound partner doesn’t deserve praise until they have emptied the rubbish bins and scoured the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person who is doing a bit or a lot more of the earning will feel similarly resentful. The money-earner is not, nowadays, encouraged to feel proud of what they do within the context of the couple; they sense that their partner does not especially respect their stressful and intense efforts to bring in money. Their work is just regarded as prestigious and deeply enjoyable for them. However, it often isn’t. They suffer too – and so will resent being treated as if they made no or just a negligible contribution to family life, when they feel they are making the whole thing possible in the first place and suffering rather a lot in the process. But at the same time, they will fear emphasising their gratitude to their partner for their focus on domestic tasks, for this may appear patronising and ‘old-fashioned’, as if they are telling a subordinate class that they are ‘doing great’ in order to keep them in their place, lyricising a task they have no intention of doing as a way of maintaining power relations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the core of the problem is that domestic work has been undervalued and paid work has been overvalued – or at least misinterpreted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making and maintaining a home and bringing up children are amongst the more serious, important and demanding of human achievements. They are certainly not for everyone but they answer to vital needs in human nature. Those who do it deserve honour and prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, though paid work can be wonderful, it frequently isn’t; and those who do it deserve a lot of sympathy and care. Most of us do it simply because we have to in order to survive and it doesn’t especially fulfil our souls. It is ironic – to put it gently – that being paid to take a photograph of an attractive kitchen for an interiors magazine, is regarded as a prestigious occupation (a dream job), while running an attractive kitchen in your own home is regarded as insignificant (just a ‘stay at home’); or that being the in-house legal-counsel for a firm that makes domestic appliances is thought a great career; yet using the appliances to clean and cook is regarded as not having a career at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to equalise prestige and also equalise gratitude. One of the pair isn’t necessarily taking the easy option, the other the humiliating option. Paid-work can be awful and unliberating, housework freeing and ennobling – and vice-versa. So both deserve respect, both deserve sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having equalised the prestige and sympathy owed to each, we then need to move away from insisting that ideally everyone should be doing exactly the same amount of exactly the same thing within a couple (50% housework [chore] &amp; 50% money-work [glorious]). We should divide things far more creatively, in a way that is responsive to individual nature. One person might be doing 75% of the housework and only 25% of the money-work, the other 75% of the money-work and only 25% of the housework and yet both parties could happily honour each other’s contribution to the overall goal: the success of the couple and its offspring.</span></p>
<p class="p2">We should move away from an obsession with brute equality towards an idea of complementarity. People don’t have to do exactly the same things in order to make an equal contribution to a collective ambition. Part of this means recalibrating prestige: going from a concern with an equality of task to an equality of the prestige of tasks. Housework &amp; paid-work both have pleasures, both have pains: both deserve respect and gratitude. The choice of who does what should not be determined by gender, neither for men nor for women, and it should never be automatic or imposed, rather agreed upon as a result of careful examination of aptitude, interest and opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple are a team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Football provides a crucial analogy for role equality. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Analogies with teams can be helpful. All positions in a football team are equally important and therefore equally prestigious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/football.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4367" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/football.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="Outgoing Colombian forward Adrian Ramos" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goalkeeper is not less of a player than the centre-forward. The fact that a defender is unlikely to score goals doesn’t mean that they are free-loading. Everyone can be grateful to everyone else – and will understand their respective challenges and difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To continue the analogy with football, what’s happened in relationships is as though, for generations, being a goalie was thought the worst job of all. Certain people – defined by some arbitrary mark (like gender) – were over hundreds of years brutally required to be goalkeepers and it was seriously frowned upon for them to try to be – or even wish to be – anything else. This repressive tradition was rightly cast aside but it left a nasty hang-over: it looked as if being a goalkeeper was a terrible role in football that no one would ever try to do for too long and that one therefore had to share absolutely equally, among unwilling participants, 8.1 minutes per person, during every match. People who in their heart of hearts wanted to be goalies would always feel uncomfortable and fear they were being looked down on by others and resent the supposedly more glamorous careers of those in other positions – while those in other positions would resist praising the goalies too much, for fear of seeming patronising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of this happens in football because here we have a much clearer sense that we’re talking about a team. The complementarity of roles is well understood. The strength and success of the team depends on people specialising in different roles. It would be a disaster if everyone had to do everything. When people specialise, everyone can feel proud of what they do and grateful to the others for their help.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What needs to happen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each person in a couple doesn’t have to do exactly half of every job in order to earn the right to think well of themselves. They need to contribute half of the overall effort; but that doesn’t necessarily mean doing half of the same task.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern life has undermined our capacity to feel grateful and stoked resentment. We don’t feel grateful towards those who do money-work (because it’s meant to be fun), and we can’t properly feel grateful to those who do housework (because it’s secretly a bit pitiful and sad). Only 50/50 is fair and because it is so rare (and in practice almost impossible), almost everyone feels resentful some of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should upgrade our norms and ideals. Fifty-fifty equality of occupation was never the true goal. It was simply a very good way of moving on from past injustice towards the legitimate aim: dignity for all and freedom of choice around what position to adopt in the team. What we truly want is for people to be able to focus on the things that they’re good at and might want to specialise in. And then we want people to collaborate in ways that allow them to achieve much more in partnership than they could on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The roles can never again automatically be defined by gender. Any one should be allowed to stay home and work – or go out to the office and work. And we should no longer be alarmed if a man or a woman freely chooses a role for themselves that was traditionally assigned to them without much discussion on the matter on the basis of gender alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ambition in relationship life is not that we should live out some abstract theoretical ideal of equality, but that we should recognise that we are a team, which means focus on what makes most sense for us to do – and to say a huge thank you to the other person for their equally large, but very different and complementary efforts on another part of the pitch.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern societies are deeply invested in the idea of big, glamorous weddings. We have evolved highly-detailed collective ideas about what a proper wedding is supposed to be like, down to the specialised floral arrangements, seat covers, presents for bridesmaids and the correct order of the speeches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1278" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486957427.jpg" alt="I do." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These belong to our culture’s current way of expressing the notion that a wedding is an important event in terms of the success of a marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the results don’t seem very encouraging: the link between the quality of the wedding and that of the subsequent relationship is tenuous at best. However grand the ceremony might be, marriages break down at an alarming – yet predictable – rate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1279" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1902387a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we know as the wedding day emerged historically out of a variety of motives: it was an event designed to show off one’s status, to embed one in the community, to invite God to witness one’s union… These ambitions don’t now feel particularly relevant. Therefore, it’s sometimes argued that we don’t need wedding ceremonies at all. Let’s junk the whole idea. We don’t need to waste so much money and go to so much trouble. A piece of paper at the registry office would be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this seems to overlook the benefit of rituals. In theory, rituals serve a hugely important function, for they orchestrate and give public expression to a sequence of emotions and actions that it would be too tricky for any one set of individuals to arrive at on their own. They give structure to interior life – and best reveal their advantages in religious rituals like the Jewish Day of Atonement or the period of mourning known as ‘iddah’ following a Muslim funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1280" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90982750.jpg" alt="Ultra-Orthodox Jews Perform Tashlich Ceremony" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that the wedding day is – in its current form – an appallingly badly designed ritual. It needs a thorough overhaul, guided by a mature, modern understanding of the underlying purpose of the occasion, which is simply to help a marriage go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course, redesigning wedding days sounds odd. We fully accept redesigns and novelty when it comes to technology. No one would think it was a good idea to keep driving a hundred-year-old car. Yet when we’re dealing with social practices, we strangely cling to the ancient with deluded fervour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4315" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/justmarried.jpg?resize=635%2C488" alt="Back View Of Car With &quot;Just Married&quot; Sign." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We do so out of fear: because marriage is such an uncertain business, we quell our anxieties by following what people have always done, attempting to insure ourselves against some new follies we might commit, but thereby ignoring that marriages have been rather catastrophic throughout history and therefore that sticking stubbornly to precedent has all the wisdom of adhering to the methods of medieval plumbing or brain surgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In redesigning the wedding day, we should wipe the slate clean and ask simply: what kind of ceremony would help a marriage to survive? How could one design a day that would make a proper contribution to the maintenance of a union?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: The need for new vows</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vows are promises we make on behalf of people who don’t yet exist about circumstances that we can’t yet fully imagine. Still, they serve an important function in at least attempting to guide our responses to the tensions of the future.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem with current vows is their optimism, which should be radically tempered, so as to avoid rage and resentment. Vows should accurately anticipate what will make us want to get divorced – and confirm to us that our subsequent sadness will not be an unusual or personal curse. Here is a selection of vows that would be made by a couple in the utopia:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I accept that I am – in countless ways I don’t yet know – very hard to live with.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>We accept not to panic when, some years from now, what we are doing today will seem like the worst decision of our lives.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>When you are mean, when you call me a c*** and a fucking bastard, I will strive to remember that at heart, it is because you are hurt – not that you are fundamentally nasty.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Everyone has some very significant things wrong with them. We promise not to look around. There isn’t anyone better out there really. Once you get to know them, everyone is impossible.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1282" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158035124.jpg" alt="Same-Sex Couples Legally Wed in Seattle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>Being allowed never to insert one’s penis into a new person, or have someone else new insert their penis into oneself, is one of the tragedies of existence. I apologise that my jealousy and your jealousy have made this peculiar, but entirely necessary self-immolation necessary.</i></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple then repeats: <i>We accept to witness the slow death of our sexuality. We realise we won’t be doing it that often from now on.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>I won’t have affairs, not because you’re so perfect, but because I’ve decided to be disappointed by you, and you alone, and you’ll be disappointed by me, and me alone, rather than both of us foisting our troubled selves on innocent members of the community, who would be deeply annoying too once one got to know them.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>[In unison with the audience] Many days we’ll be unhappy; many days, we’ll suffer, many days we’ll regret we ever did this crazy thing. It’s not congratulations we need, it’s commiserations.</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Lots of guests</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s a growing trend, often driven by financial concerns, towards slightly smaller weddings but a big crowd is, in fact, supremely important (even if the budget only stretches to a sandwich for them later).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One needs a maximum number of people there for a simple reason: so as to cause maximum embarrassment in years to come at the idea of having to call them all up and announce news of divorce. The larger the crowd, the slower one will be to pick up the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1283" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/120209645.jpg" alt="Guests arrive for the wedding between En" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© AFP/Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This gives due recognition to an important fact about marriage: it’s a social institution, in which we often stay for reasons that go way beyond our own emotional desires. It involves us, but it’s not just about us. It’s about the dog, the children, the grandparents, the friends who got married in imitation of us and whose own relationships would suffer if we split… This sense it isn’t just about us should come as a huge source of relief. There’s nothing harder than to be required to be happy in and for ourselves. What relief to know we will, with time, also be living for others and that our own frame of mind won’t always be such a big deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Different sorts of presents</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a Utopian Wedding, the guests would offer the couple different sorts of presents. Primarily, they would arrive with accounts of why their own marriages were difficult and why they were themselves awkward people to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1284" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/76590233.jpg" alt="Wedding Ceremony Of Hong Kong Actor Lawrence Ng Kai Wah" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nothing makes us happier than news of the troubles of others, as these presents would implicitly recognise. At dark moments in the marriage, one would turn to these gifts and flip through descriptions of the marital troubles of one’s friends and relatives – and would come away feeling that one was cursed certainly, but – importantly – in no way alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If single guests were unable to produce such things, they would arrive with vouchers for couples’ therapy, to contribute to the enormous sum that will have to be spent on therapy over the lifetime of any decent marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Speeches</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A typical marriage recognises the key role of parents and gives them a platform. The father of the bride often makes an elaborate speech telling the world how great his daughter is. This is sweet, but in no way protects the daughter he claims to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1285" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1284280a.jpg" alt="USA Life" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/West Coast Surfer/Mood Board</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Parents are in command of some vital information that can help a marriage. They know how disturbed they themselves are and the particular family patterns of emotional neuroses which they have witnessed and then unleashed on their own children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wedding day offers a stellar opportunity for the parents of both the bride and the groom to stand up and address their children and their friends on the subject of: ‘The particular ways in which we have messed up the children.’ There would be an added speech on the topic of: ‘How we think our children will be hard to live with, given what we know of them.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This will be crucial information, far surpassing childhood photos and home movies in utility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: A certificate of marriage worthiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, you would get married by a philosopher/psychoanalyst (rather than the two useless current figures, a priest or a local government official). The wedding ceremony would be a passing out celebration for a couple who had been through a substantial course (no less than 12 months) of self-knowledge and mutual education in the psychology of relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic culture suggests that relationships are essentially founded on emotional states: like tenderness, the feeling of missing the other person and sexual passion. This is evidently reckless and in the utopia, there would be a new more logical, classical approach which would recommend strenuous conscious attempts to achieve a mature understanding of love. Many of the skills of marriage would overlap with those of a bomb disposal expert.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1286" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/71083487.jpg" alt="Atomic Cake" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Utopia, the wedding day would be like a graduation ceremony, a culmination of a year of intense study of one of the trickiest and most academic subjects in the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Symbols</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The symbols currently associated with marriage (silver horseshoes, bells, white dresses, confetti) can seem to fall somewhere between the merely charming and the obviously superstitious. Few people feel a bridal veil offers robust protection against evil spirits. It’s tempting to think we should jettison symbolism entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the point of a symbol is to make an idea stick in your mind. In the Utopia, the couple would accept small sealed boxes from each other. The box would represent the idea that there will be parts of the other person one will not understand – or perhaps even know – and yet one will have to accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4316" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/present.jpg?resize=635%2C469" alt="William Holden Hiding Present From Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1">© Getty</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The box would be accompanied by a ‘Tolstoy’ – a brief, but very honest, confession of one’s failings and weaknesses. The Russian novelist gave his wife a written account of his earlier sexual life and an ample description of the flaws of his character, so she would know what she was letting herself in for. The content would be prepared and discussed in the lead up to the marriage; the book would stand for the willingness to listen to – and bear with – one’s partner’s troubles. The exchange of Tolstoys would symbolise a shared ability to cope with the other person’s confusion and distress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Wedding photos</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The aim of photos is to bottle the essence of the wedding and make it available to us when we need it later.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1288" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1042074x-1.jpg" alt="Carolyn and Fabio wed in the remote village of Airor on the Knoydart Peninsula in the Scottish Highlands, Britain  - 11 Nov 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Rex/Angus Blackburn</h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a wedding album should not only or even primarily be a visual record of a particular day, and evidence of who was in attendance. The task of the photographer is to create a series of works of art, made on many days, and perhaps not at all on the day of the wedding itself, that would remind the couple of answers to some key questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(i) Why did we get together?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(ii) What virtues did we see in one another when we got married?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iii) What impact does each person’s family have on the relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">(iv) How normal are marital problems in society at large?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looking back at one’s ‘wedding photos’ in subsequent years would then take its place within the overall purpose of the wedding: it would help, in a small way, to persuade us to stay married.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Conclusion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of a wedding – and the elaborate rituals that surround it – do not at present have our real needs in focus. But that doesn’t mean to say that we’d be better off jettisoning the whole ceremony. We still need ceremony and institutions, just better ones. We should take very seriously – and be collectively ambitious about – what wedding days could and should be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Utopian thinking sounds like dreamy stuff. But in truth, one of the uses of Utopian thinking is to move us away from silly fantasy. Instead of seeing the ‘dream wedding’ in terms of palm trees and infinity pools, we should be asking what a wedding would be like if it properly helped marriages to go better. That should give us inspiration as we set about reforming the mediocre marriage practices we currently have</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/couplerestaurant.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5033" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/couplerestaurant.jpg?resize=635%2C378" alt="200011614-001" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They have a habit of ruining embarrassingly long stretches of our lives. They will – by nature – seem absurd to others for they are triggered by what are, ostensibly, very ‘small things’: the sink left a certain way, a remark about when to cross the road, an almost imperceptibly off-hand response to an apparently passing comment… And yet their consequences will be extreme. Sulks might start without warning on a Monday and not be quite done by Thursday, they can be kept going in the middle of weddings and family celebrations, they can survive the presence of small children and office colleagues, they hound anniversaries and birthdays, they are particularly prone to erupt in idyllic locations which one has spent a fortune paying for (they gestate at the nice hotels of the world like bacteria at warm polluted water sources). But despite the amount of time they take up in our lives, remarkably little seems ever to have been written about them, for once they are over, it is hard even to recall that they happened, so demeaning are they to our sense of reason and dignity. The philosophy of sulking is a book still waiting to be written.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, sulking appears to combine intense anger with an intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about. One both desperately needs to be understood and yet is utterly committed to not explaining oneself plainly. Having to explain oneself is indeed the central problem: if our partner requires an explanation, then this is proof they are not worthy of having anything explained to them. Which brings one to the odd privilege of being the recipient of a sulk: one only gets into a sulk with people whom one feels <i>should</i> understand, that is, people one respects. It is one of the stranger gifts of love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1758" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/charlesdi.jpg" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we sulk with people who should know that you don’t want to talk about your day; that you were upset by the phone call and that you don’t really like that painting or the new layout of the patio – without any of this ever having to be spelt out to you as if you were just one of the others. People who may have been highly articulate all day with colleagues at the office or with small children or relatives will, over a ‘tiny’ matter, suddenly become obstinate and furiously uncommunicative with a partner, because these characters, of all people, should just know. A sulk is a sign of deep hope. One would never bother to storm out of a room, bang the door and call someone a shit and then stay silent the rest of the evening in an upstairs room unless one loved a person really very much indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shelley21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5035" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shelley21.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="shelley2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Romantic poets like Shelley are in large part responsible for the epidemic of sulks that stalks the modern world, for it was they who popularised the romantic doctrine that true lovers can see deep into each other’s soul without language. Love is therefore, in this account, the end of all loneliness. In true love, the other person understands without you needing to explain; its greatest proof is that two people don’t have to speak and yet understand one another nevertheless (hence the privileged role of silent contemplation of another’s eyes). Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, and yet in practice catastrophic, romantic ideal of love: wordless understanding.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People didn’t sulk much before 1800 – because they didn’t have high expectations of being understood deeply, and intuitively, by others. It was people like Shelley who incited sulking, because they promoted the idea that relationships are based on special insights into one another’s characters achieved <i>without conversation</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some level, the structure of the sulk reveals a debt to earliest childhood. In the womb, we never had to explain what we needed. Food and comfort simply came. If we had the privilege of being well parented, some of that idyll may have continued in our first years. We didn’t have to make our every need known: someone guessed for us. They saw through our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions: they found the explanations when we didn’t have the ability to verbalise. That was the greatest kindness. It was an effort of love. Then came the struggle to learn to speak, driven in part by the failure of others to understand us well enough. Language is born from disappointment. Eloquence is a sign of how misunderstood we have felt in danger of being, which is why it is an asset that one may be highly unwilling to call upon in love. The most articulate person may simply not want to explain themselves in the confines of a relationship; it seems like a betrayal of that romantic dream of being understood without needing to utter a word.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sulkers are hence the worst of teachers. There is a lesson to impart combined with an utter unwillingness to spell it out patiently to an audience. This tells us something about successful teaching: it helps not to care too much whether or not the audience winds up understanding. A little bit of indifference is a genuine asset for a teacher. Yet because we care so much in love that we are understood (our life is in the person’s hands), we simply cannot react calmly to a minor instance of being misread. Something that would be forgivable in 99.9% of humanity becomes grounds to slam doors and leave rooms in fury. Behind the sulk, there is panic: we may be wasting our lives with someone deeply unsuited to interpreting us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cure is, as so often, a dose of pessimism. Time always helps because it brings with it evidence of how many other people there are who understand us even less than our lovers: global misunderstanding takes the pressure of its particularly painful local instances. In a more helpful culture than our own, we would be reminded that our partners may be very nice and at the same time very likely to misunderstand, without evil intent, a good number of our moods. Even at their best, they will be mistaken in their interpretations of a raft of our central needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To calm us down in the midst of a sulk, we should be reminded that it is not really a sign of love for every aspect of our souls to be grasped without us needing to say anything. It is no insult to us to be called upon to develop our eloquence. When our lovers fail to understand, it isn’t an immediate sign that they are heartless. It may merely be that, out of a romantic prejudice, we have grown a little too committed to not teaching them about who we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, we would more readily recognise (when we can manage a compassionate mood) the comic aspect of sulking – even when we are the special target of the sulker’s fury and rage. We would see the touching paradox. The sulker may be six foot one and employed by a major law firm, but they are in fact saying: ‘Deep inside, I remain an infant and right now, I need you to be my parent. I need you to guess what is truly ailing me, as people did when I was a baby, when my ideas of love were formed’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sulk can be overcome when this insane, touching ambition reveals its comedic dimension. We are then in a position to laugh, not because we don’t care, but because we understand how crazy both our lover and the species to which they belong happen to be. We haven’t been cursed with an especially mad example of a person. Even though our partner has accused us of some truly revolting things and is behaving with advanced viciousness, we do them the greatest possible favour when we look at their tantrum as we would that of a one-year-old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so alive to the notion of being patronised when considered as younger than we are; we forget that this is also, at times, the greatest privilege. We look beyond the sulker’s callous words and the slammed door. We grasp the real suffering beneath the horrible exterior, we see that our adversary is hurt not mean, and are struck – once more – by how oddly human nature is arranged. But because we understand, we are no longer frightened or angry in turn. The furious, hopeful, deluded absurdity of our partner’s trouble makes us gently smile. We get ready to knock at the door and gently ask if they might let us in for a word.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/briefencounter1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4424" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/briefencounter1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="BRIEF ENCOUNTER, Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, 1945" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5><span class="s1"><b>Brief Encounter, 1945</b></span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Part of the problem is how keen we are to say, at once, how deeply awful it is. Society moves with unhelpful speed from recognition to condemnation. The only ones who would even think of it are, by definition, only ever very bad people indeed. In an age that has accepted almost every kind of sexual practice, it remains the ultimate transgression, violating the greatest of all contemporary myths: that of the natural lifelong monogamous fusion of love and sex.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet no understanding will come from such a hasty refusal to acknowledge adultery’s full power over the human imagination. Before we can begin to call it ‘wrong’, we should concede that it must also, at some level, for a time at least, for some people (who cannot all be merely monsters) be profoundly enticing. What might a case for it go like?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a start, simply how normal it is to contemplate. It would be deeply unusual to expect people to grow up in hedonistic liberated circles, experience the sweat and excitement of nightclubs and summer parks, be bathed in images of desire and songs of longing and ecstasy, and then one day, at the command of a certificate, renounce all further sexual discoveries in the name of no particular god and no higher commandment, just an unexplored supposition that it must all be very wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But why?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be provocative: what if there was something wrong in not being tempted, in not realising just how short a time one had been allotted on this earth and therefore with what urgent curiosity one might want to explore the unique fleshly individuality of more than one of one’s contemporaries? To moralise too swiftly against adultery is to deny the seductive powers of a dramatic amount: another person’s laugh or well-timed irony, a first kiss, a new nakedness – each of these a sensory high point in its own way as worthy of reverence as more socially prestigious attractions, like the tiles of the Alhambra or Bach’s Mass in B Minor. Isn’t the blanket rejection of such temptations a little too neat, an infidelity towards the chaotic richness of life itself? Could one trust anyone who would not, under certain circumstances, show any interest in being untrustworthy?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/isabelle.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1"><b>Isabelle Huppert in the 1991 film of <i>Madame Bovary</i></b></span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The adulterer is meant to feel ashamed; the betrayed party is encouraged to be furious – with every right to an apology. And yet, from another perspective, shouldn’t the latter sometimes be the one to apologise to the former? Adultery may be the lightning conductor of modern indignation, but are there not other, subtler ways of betraying a person than by sleeping with someone outside the couple; by omitting to listen, by forgetting to evolve and enchant, or more generally and blamelessly, by simply being one’s own limited self? Rather than forcing their ‘betrayers’ to say they were so sorry, the ‘betrayed’ might begin by apologising themselves, apologise for forcing their partners to lie by setting the bar of truthfulness so forbiddingly high – out of no higher creed than a jealous insecurity masquerading as a moral standard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anger against adultery evades a basic, tragic truth: no one can be everything to another person. It is only a child who can believe this (wrongly) of a parent. Yet rather than accept the ghastly thought with dignified grace and melancholy, betrayed spouses are encouraged to accuse their ‘betrayers’ of sin. However, there may be only one cardinal wrong: the ethos of modern marriage, with its peculiar brittle insistence that one person must embody the complete sexual and emotional solution to another’s every need.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/happy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4426" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/happy.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No other society besides our own has ever been so hopeful about marriage, nor ultimately, and as a consequence, quite so regularly disappointed. The needs for sex, for love and for family have never been so insistently and hysterically yoked together. This is the distinctive creed of our own times, an altar over which an unusual amount of pain continues to be daily expended. We’d be better off undertaking a more disturbing and useful thought-experiment: daring to humanise and understand the motives of our all too ubiquitous hate figure: the adulterer.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If believing in the ideals of marriage is often naive, so too is believing that adultery can be an effective antidote to its many disappointments.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/annak1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4435" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/annak1.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="Anna Karenina - 1997" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sean Bean and Sophie Marceau in the 1997 film of <i>Anna Karenina</i></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is ultimately ‘wrong’ with adultery is its sheer dangerous optimism. While it may look at first sight like a cynical activity to engage in, adultery in fact betrays an absurdly hopeful conviction that one can somehow magically rearrange the difficulties and shortcomings of marriage through a lie. This is to misunderstand the facts of life. It is impossible to sleep with someone outside of marriage and not violently destroy the things one still cares about inside it – and yet, in case we get carried away with the charms of fidelity, it is equally impossible to remain utterly faithful in a marriage and yet not miss out on some of life’s greatest and most significant pleasures that lie outside the couple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In short, as the adulterer forgets (to the huge cost of those they care about and who believe in them), there is no solution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1793" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/monica.jpg" alt="EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY MONICA LEWINSKY DURING HIS TESTIMONY TO THE GRAND JURY IN WASHINGTON, AMERICA - 1998" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Monica Lewinsky gets to know Bill Clinton in the White House, 1995</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no answer to the tensions of marriage, if what one means by an ‘answer’ is a settlement in which no party suffers a loss, and in which every positive element can coexist with every other, without either causing or sustaining grievous damage.The three things people usually want in this sphere – love, sex and family – each affects and harms the others in devilish ways. Loving a person may inhibit the ability to have sex with him or her. Yet having a secret tryst can fatally endanger a relationship with a spouse who is loved but no longer excites. However, having children can imperil both love and sex, and yet neglecting the kids in order to focus on marriage or sexual thrills may threaten the health and mental stability of the next generation. The choice isn’t between happiness and grief; all that is on offer are different varieties of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Helen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4431" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Helen.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="Helen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Helen’s affair with Paris sparked the Trojan War</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Periodically, frustration breeds an impulse to seek a utopian solution. Perhaps an open marriage would work. Or a policy of secrets. Or a renegotiation of the contract on a yearly basis. Or more child care. All such strategies are fated to fail, however, for the simple reason that loss is written into the rules of the situation. If we sleep around, we will put at risk our spouse’s love and the psychological health of our children. If we don’t sleep around, we will go stale and miss out on the excitement of new relationships. If we keep an affair secret, it will corrode us inside and stunt our capacity to receive another’s love. If we confess to infidelity, our partner will panic and never get over our sexual adventures (even if they meant nothing to us). If we focus all of our energies on our children, they will eventually abandon us to pursue their own lives, leaving us wretched and lonely. But if we ignore our children in favour of our own romantic pursuits as a couple, we will scar them and earn their unending resentment. Marriage is like a bed sheet that can never be straightened: when we seek to perfect or ameliorate one side of it, we will succeed only in further wrinkling and disturbing the others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kristen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4432" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kristen.jpg?resize=635%2C389" alt="'Snow White and The Huntsman' film photocall, Park Hyatt Hotel, Sydney, Australia - 19 Jun 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Kristen Stewart betrayed Robert Pattinson with director Rupert Sanders</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only cure for infidelity is pessimism. We need new sadder vows to exchange with partners in order to stand a sincere chance of mutual fidelity over a lifetime. Certainly something far more cautionary and downbeat than the usual platitudes would be in order – for example:  ‘I promise to be disappointed by you and you alone. I promise to make you the sole repository of my regrets, rather than to distribute them widely through multiple affairs and a life of sexual Don Juanism. I have surveyed the different options for unhappiness, and it is you I have chosen to commit myself to.’ These are the sorts of generously pessimistic and kindly unromantic promises that couples should make to each other at the altar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thereafter, an affair would be a betrayal only of a reciprocal pledge to be disappointed in a particular way, not of an unrealistic hope. Spouses who had been cheated upon would no longer furiously complain that they had expected their partner to be happy with them per se. Instead they could more poignantly and justly cry, ‘I was relying on you to be loyal to the specific variety of disappointment which I represent.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too many people start off in relationships by putting the moral emphasis in the wrong place, smugly mocking the urge to stray as if it were something disgusting and unthinkable. But in truth, it is the ability to stay that is both wondrous and worthy of honour; it is not the norm. Fidelity is a heroic achievement. That a couple should be willing to watch their lives go by from within the cosy cage of marriage, without acting on extra-mural sexual impulses, is a miracle of civilisation and kindness for which daily gratitude is in order.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1797" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anthonycleo.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Antony and Cleopatra</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spouses who remain faithful to each other should recognise the scale of the sacrifice they are making. There is nothing biologically ‘normal’ or cost-free about sexual renunciation. Fidelity deserves to be celebrated as a high point of the ethical imagination – ideally with some medals and the sounding of a public gong – rather than discounted as an unremarkable norm whose undermining by an affair should quickly provoke utter rage. A loyal marriage ought at all times to retain within it an awareness of the immense forbearance and pessimistic, stoic generosity which the two parties are showing one another in managing not to sleep around (or, for that matter, in refraining from killing each other). That is something to feel truly hopeful about.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Perhaps you never had such a figure in your life, but let’s imagine for a moment what a good mother might have been like: when you were a baby, she fed you in the night; you cried at 3am and she got up to comfort you until you eventually found your way back to sleep an hour later. When you had a cold, she brought you toast and soldiers in bed. She was very interested in small things about you, like how you did in the school geography exam or the graze you got on your knee in the running race. Nowadays, she wants you to be happy, that’s what counts. Professional success isn’t the point. And when you mess up, your troubles are hers. She will put her own needs aside for you. She won’t demand that you take her difficulties as seriously as she takes yours.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="4309819366_2bd3b79c33_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">
<p class="p2">She applauded even when your efforts were nothing special, yet she won’t remind you of any of it or even expect much gratitude. You are likely to understand – eventually – what she did, but only years later, and maybe too late to return the kindness.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an extraordinary image of what love could be. As adults, we often demand this sort of love of each other – and are likely to make a bitter discovery in the process: that we cannot now find again the love we knew as children. We rage against this and blame the other person for their inability to perfectly intuit our needs, until the day we reach a true maturity, realising that the only release from our longing for this sort of love is to stop demanding such love for ourselves and to learn to give it to somebody else, perhaps a child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2089" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-130314-mummyB.jpg" alt="PM-130314-mummyB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is one of the most fascinating aspects of religions that they fully recognise the strength of our need for a mummy. In Catholicism, in shrines around the world, the sorrowful, the sad and the desperate will glance up at an image of Mary, light candles, say prayers and speak of their individual griefs to a mother who is symbolically the mother of all believers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/499075211_f85faf748c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/499075211_f85faf748c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="499075211_f85faf748c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From a robustly rational perspective, devotion to Mary seems to exemplify religion at its most infantile and soft-headed. How could any reasonable adult trust in the existence of a woman who lived several thousand years ago (if she ever lived at all), much less draw comfort from a projected belief in her unblemished heart, her selfless sympathy and her limitless patience?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The drift of the question is hard to refute; it is simply the wrong question to raise. The apposite point is not whether the Virgin exists, but what it tells us about human nature that so many Christians over two millennia felt the need to invent her. Our focus should be on what the Virgin Mary reveals about our emotional requirements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the broadest sense, the cult of Mary speaks of the extent to which, despite our adult powers of reasoning, our responsibilities and our status, the needs of childhood endure within us. While for long stretches of our lives, we can believe in our maturity, we never succeed in insulating ourselves against the kind of catastrophic events that sweep away our ability to reason, our courage and our resourcefulness at putting dramas in perspective and throw us back into a state of primordial helplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At such moments we may long to be held and reassured, as we were decades ago by some sympathetic adult, most likely our mother, a person who made us feel physically protected, stroked our hair, looked at us with benevolence and tenderness and perhaps said not very much other than, very quietly, ‘of course’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be seen, in any way, as babyish, childish or in need of mummy is to risk being scorned as an incompetent adult. Yet the needs are real. And we pay a price for dismissing them. We become desperate and feel very lonely. We might turn harshly on ourselves – getting angry because we feel ashamed of being weak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-130314-mummyD.jpg" alt="PM-130314-mummyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">For their part, Buddhists have evolved the figure of Guanyin for the very same reasons as Catholics invented Mary. She too has kind eyes and can suggest alternatives to despising oneself. In temples and outdoor plazas across the East, adults allow themselves to be weak in her presence. Her gaze has a habit of making people cry – for the moment one breaks down isn’t so much when things are hard as when one finally encounters kindness and a chance to admit to sorrows one has been harbouring in silence for too long. Like Mary, Guanyin has a measure of the difficulties involved in trying to lead a remotely adequate adult life. Guanyin does not act powerfully to solve our problems. The point is that just being heard; feeling that one’s pain is recognised, and taken seriously, is – in itself – a great help. She regards us with tenderness, when no-one else will, and strengthens us to face the tasks of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern society struggles to update what such figures as Mary and Guanyin represent. We don’t have a contemporary version of the publically available nurturing ‘mother’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is easy to label as childish needs which should really be honoured as more generally human, for there is in truth no maturity without an adequate negotiation with the infantile and no such thing as a grown-up who does not regularly yearn to be comforted like a child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity describes the capacity to accept the idea of one’s ongoing child-like nature as a mark of moral and spiritual health. Psychoanalysts would agree. Only the brittle and unnaturally haughty would attempt to deny their weaknesses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In religious ages in Europe, images of loving mothers were displayed in multitudes of shrines, temples and churches or on the sides of buildings. So the reassuring, generous message could reach people wherever they happened to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-130314-mummyE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4475" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-130314-mummyE.jpg?resize=635%2C412" alt="2832750a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Today, we have no problem at all with messages being displayed in public places – only they are more likely to concern the possibility of buying a special kind of sports shoe or advising us on how we can save a bit of money on car insurance. We’ve given over so much of this public terrain to people who are primarily concerned with making money out of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a culture that recognises our common, widespread, deep need for maternal care – and the benefits of being reminded of the need. This is a political task – though it is one that does not (unfortunately) figure on the agenda of any major political party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be useful if architects and artists were occasionally to create works which took parental care as their central theme. Spaces for Tenderness, where we could, in the best sense regress; contemplate maternal images in a twilight ambience, while lying on cushions under the cover of soft woollen blankets of the sort that once swaddled us in our earliest days.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Why is it so interesting and exciting? Few philosophers have explored the topic with the necessary rigour.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2115" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Origin.jpg" alt="Origin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has to do with loneliness and self-disgust. When we begin in this world, if we’re lucky, everything about us is acceptable and adorable, from our toes to our temples. We lie naked on our parents’ skin, they can hear our heartbeat, we can see the delight in their eyes as they watch us do nothing more accomplished than blow a saliva bubble or suck our fingers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then gradually comes the fall. The nipple is taken away. We grow ashamed of our nakedness. Ever-expanding areas of our outer selves are forbidden to be touched by others. We have no choice but to keep a minimum of 60 or, even better, 90 centimetres’ distance between us and others at all times, to make it absolutely clear that our compromised selves have no intention of intruding into anyone’s personal space. We grow guarded. We become adults, expelled from paradise, unappealing to almost everyone we walk past.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we truly are, in every area; to be loved for just existing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030414-oralsexB.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4629" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030414-oralsexB.gif?resize=635%2C527" alt="PM-030414-oralsexB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hence the significance of oral sex. It sounds disgusting when we think of doing it with an inappropriate person – and that’s the point. Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting. But with the right person, at the precise juncture where disgust could be at its height, we feel only acceptance, welcome and permission. The privileged nature of a relationship is sealed by an act which, with someone else, would have been sickening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s ‘rude’ – in the best way. Normal life continually requires us to be polite. We cannot win the respect or affection of anyone without severely repressing all that is ostensibly ‘bad’ within us: our secretions, our aggression, our heedlessness, our fragility, our lust. We cannot both be accepted by society and reveal who we really are. Hence the erotic ecstasy (which is more accurately really just an emotional relief) when oral sex permits our secret self, with all its ‘bad’ and dirty sides, to be witnessed and enthusiastically endorsed by someone we like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2118" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sex.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bond of loyalty between a couple grows stronger with every increase in explicitness. The more unacceptable our behaviour would be to the larger world, the more we feel as if we are building a haven of mutual acceptance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sex liberates us for a time from that punishing dichotomy between dirty and clean. It literally purifies us – by engaging the most apparently polluted sides of ourselves in its games. We can press our mouths, the most public and respectable aspects of our faces, the seat of language and articulacy, eagerly into the most contaminated parts of the other – thereby symbolising a total psychological approval, much as a priest would accept a penitent, guilty of many transgressions, back in the fold of the Catholic Church with a light kiss on the head.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/167118119.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4633" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/167118119.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="VATICAN-POPE-MASS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>From a psychological point of view, very similar to oral sex</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure of oral sex is hence deeply rich and significant. It isn’t primarily about a pleasant physiological sensation at all, it’s about acceptance. It’s about an end to loneliness.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Match.com is one of the world’s leading dating sites. Officially it is all in favour of people getting married.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many obstacles to being married. And getting together with someone is only the first – and in many ways the least challenging – of these hurdles.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Match.com is devoted to the task of helping us find the ‘right’ person, which, in its view, means someone who shares our tastes, interests and general attitudes to life. Match.com subscribes to the compatibility idea of relationships, which notes that we tend to get on best with people who share our interests. This might be true in the short term. But, over an extended period of time, the relevance of this fades dramatically. Indeed, the person who is best suited to us is not the person who shares our tastes, but someone who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently and wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4344" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchC.jpg?resize=635%2C675" alt="Married couple holding hands in front of painting in art gallery" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for compatibility is dangerous because it has a tendency to escalate absurdly. Two people who like reading and sport might fall out terribly because one is obsessed with crime fiction, while the other is always wanting to talk about archaeology. One wants to go to the hockey match but the other is obsessed with canoeing. So the temptation is to refine the search. But this leads to astonishing levels of detail. One ends up searching for a partner who is keen on fly-fishing and the novels of John le Carrè, who loves going camping in North Cornwall in September and who is sympathetic to the Liberal Party (but also an enthusiast of tactical voting). But, of course, two such people could easily come to blows over the colour of the bedroom curtains, children’s names, the use of napkins, or the ethics of fracking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4345" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-180314-matchD.jpg?resize=635%2C709" alt="VARIOUS - 2002" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When people actually are together long-term, what they have to deal with are all the things that they don’t like about the other person and don’t share. That is the real challenge of relationships and yet it is one that is implicitly denied by Match.com, which emphasises precisely the opposite: ‘compatibility’ as the key to love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The danger is that when lovers do get together, the moment they hit a hurdle, if they sense they are ‘incompatible’, they will panic. If their tastes in coffee or child rearing differ, then they had best split up – surely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than asking us ever more refined questions about our tastes in order to align them, Match.com should investigate what people are like when things end up mismatched, as they inevitably do in real relationships: when our lovers surprise us by not agreeing with us, when there is a need to back down, when one isn’t going to get all one wants. Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate difference that’s the true marker of the ‘right’ person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For almost all of human history, it has been unthinkable that someone could lay claim to maturity, sanity and reliability by pinning a picture by a six-year-old to the walls of their office, or throne room. At least until the 20th century, the art that won prestige showed great command of technical skills and a sensitive fidelity to the real appearance of things.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2449" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kennedy.jpg" alt="kennedy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Child’s art in the office: pioneer Bobby Kennedy, in the early 1960’s</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is it about children (reflected in their bold, vivid, and utterly distorted and wonky drawings) that we now see special merit in? We know casually that children – and their art – can be very sweet. But what is really going on beneath that word ‘sweetness’ and quite why do we seem to need this quality so much at this point in history?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The work below was done by Noah. He is five and three quarters and lives in Durham, England. His father, who is a regional manager for a supermarket chain, has it prominently in his cubicle at work. The art shows mum, dad, Noah and little brother James. It is raining, as it often does in that part of the world. But the mood is decisively upbeat. The artist seems broadly extremely optimistic about the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2450" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/childsdrawing.jpg" alt="childsdrawing" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">More valuable than the Mona Lisa</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What often touches us in the art of children are a host of qualities that are deeply under threat in adult lives and yet which we unconsciously recognise as precious to a sense of inner balance and psychological well-being. The sweet is a vital part of ourselves – currently in exile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most recurring features of children’s art is evidence of trust. So long as things have gone reasonably well, children can believe in surfaces: if mummy smiles, she must be OK. There is, at a young age, blessedly little room for ambiguity. Children are not always trying to peer below the surface and discover the compromises and evasions that belong to maturity. Their art functions as a highly necessary corrective to cynicism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adult lives seldom allow us not to be wary and suspicious. We grow to expect trouble to come from any direction. We are aware of the fragility of things; and how easily safety and hope can be crushed. It is rare to have fifteen minutes without being submerged by a new wave of anxiety. It is therefore understandable if we turn with relief to the trusting attitude of those great diminutive artists, as brilliant at lifting our spirits as they are hopeless at delivering correct representations of an oak tree or a human face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Noah’s picture is full of hints as to what we deeply need. For a start, we need to be more willing to suppose that most other people are really quite nice. A touch of cynicism is – obviously – highly useful. It’s just that collectively we have talked ourselves into giving a cynical attitude too much prestige. It crowds out other things we require. And children’s drawings have become our contemporary way of smuggling them in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another endearing and psychologically necessary quality of children’s art is quite how inaccurate it tends to be. A traditional assumption of drawing is that being ‘good’ at it requires one to lay aside the demands of one’s own ego in order to pay precise attention to what is actually out there. The artist must learn how to observe the world, and in order to do so, must put a lot of themselves to one side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2452" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/childsdrawing3.jpg" alt="childsdrawing3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the child responsible for the scene above hasn’t tried to look objectively at a tree and work out just how a branch is attached to a trunk, or what precise shape a leaf is. Rather than being in any way painstaking or faithful, the child is gleefully unconcerned as to the true facts of the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is sweet is this daring lack of interest in ‘getting it right’ which symbolises a delightful freedom from concern about whether others will think it right or not either. Again, the term sweetness is our way of acknowledging that this is something we need to do a little more of in our own lives, but find very hard to ask for directly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s totally understandable that we learn, as adults, to accommodate ourselves to the needs of reality and of other people. But we can devote ourselves to this goal with so much zeal, our souls dry up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This painstakingly beautiful drawing was done by the English 19th century artist and critic John Ruskin. Ruskin, like many artists, saw drawing as a process whereby we properly attend to the singularity of things out there in the world. He saw the great artist as a paragon of ‘unselfishness’, caring more about the proper appearance of a leaf than the demands of his or her own ego. He was keen that children learn to draw ‘properly’ from a young age (four was not too young in his eyes). He did not ascribe any value to their untutored, spontaneous ‘scribbles’. He was – in a sense – right, and at the same time, profoundly wrong…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2453" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ruskin2.jpg" alt="ruskin2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children are sometimes at their sweetest when they suggest schemes that adults know are utterly impractical. A five-year-old thinks it would be nice to have a career that combines being an astronaut with being chef for his mum; his sister plans to keep an elephant in the garden; a boy says he’d like to marry his elder brother, another that he wants to invent a machine that will allow him to reverse time. Rather than dismissing these as idiotic or impractical ideas, we are frequently enchanted when children talk, as they often do, with great earnestness about their plans to reform or improve on the conditions of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sweetness lies in the way their thoughts have not yet had to be tested by experience. They can still make utopian leaps, without censoring themselves. Our pleasure is a sign that we, the adults, have grown painfully short on this freedom ourselves. We find it poignant and touching to witness their ideas (a plan to make the biggest bridge in the world out of Lego or to invent an airplane that runs on water) because we realise that we have crushed this faculty of freedom a little too rigorously in ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2455" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Mission_control_center-1.jpg" alt="Mission_control_center-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is not, in fact, strange that it is this period of human history that has been the first to get really interested in the sweetness of children.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Societies get sensitive to things that they are missing. We live in a world of highly complex technology, extreme precision in science, massive bureaucracies, insecurity and intense meritocratic competition. To survive with any degree of success in these conditions, we have to be exceptionally controlled, forward-thinking, reasonable and cautious creatures. However, we tend not to identify what has grown in short supply in our lives head on. It would be rare to say: we need more flights of fancy, more innocent trust, more gleeful disregard of expectations… We have forgotten that this is what we even want. Instead, we simply find it moving – in fact sweet – to encounter these things in symbolic forms in the scribblings of a child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Children’s art provides an opportunity to start to get to know our own needs. They are, in their own way, political demands, compact manifestos for some of the things we urgently need a little more of in the anxious, compromised conditions of contemporary adult life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2456" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/factory-juverston.jpg" alt="factory-juverston" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Against such a backdrop, children’s art is no longer just endearing, it is positively necessary</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It used to be when you’d hit certain financial and social milestones: when you had a home to your name, a set of qualifications on the mantelpiece and a few cows and a parcel of land in your possession.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10218912636_98775ae40c_k-11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4481" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10218912636_98775ae40c_k-11.jpg?resize=635%2C463" alt="10218912636_98775ae40c_k-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But when, under the influence of Romantic ideology, this grew to seem altogether too mercenary and calculating, the focus shifted to emotions. It came to be thought important to feel the right way. That was the true sign of a good union. And the right feelings included the sense that the other was ‘the one’, that you understood one another perfectly and that you’d both never want to sleep with anyone else again.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">These ideas, though touching, have proved to be an almost sure recipe for the eventual dissolution of marriages – and have caused havoc in the emotional lives of millions of otherwise sane and well-meaning couples.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1625" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/162996015.jpg" alt="Fletcher Jones III And Dalene Kurtis Wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">As a corrective to them, what follows is a proposal for a very different set of principles, more Classical in temper, which indicate when two people should properly consider themselves ready for marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are ready for marriage…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">1. When we give up on perfection </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should not only admit in a general way that the person we are marrying is very far from perfect. We should also grasp the specifics of their imperfections: how they will be irritating, difficult, sometimes irrational, and often unable to sympathise or understand us. Vows should be rewritten to include the terse line: ‘I agree to marry this person even though they will, on a regular basis, drive me to distraction.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/174302513.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4483" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/174302513.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Nicoletta Orsomando wearing a wedding dress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, these flaws should never be interpreted as merely capturing a local problem. No one else would be better. We are as bad. We are a flawed species. Whomever one got together with would be radically imperfect in a host of deeply serious ways. One must conclusively kill the idea that things would be ideal with any other creature in this galaxy. There can only ever be a ‘good enough’ marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For this realisation to sink in, it helps to have had a number of relationships before marrying, not in order to have the chance to locate ‘the right person’, but so that one can have ample opportunity to discover at first hand, in many different contexts, the truth that everyone (even the most initially exciting prospect) really is a bit wrong close up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">2. When we despair of being understood</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Love starts with the experience of being understood in a deeply supportive and uncommon way. They understand the lonely parts of you; you don’t have to explain why you find a particular joke so funny; you hate the same people; they too want to try out a particular sexual scenario.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1634" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141554915.jpg" alt="Alain Delon And Romy Schneider" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This will not continue. Another vow should read: ‘However much the other seems to understand me, there will always be large tracts of my psyche that will remain incomprehensible to them, anyone else and even me.’</span></p>
<p class="p1">We shouldn’t, therefore, blame our lovers for a dereliction of duty in failing to interpret and grasp our internal workings. They were not tragically inept. They simply couldn’t understand who we were and what we needed – which is wholly normal. No one properly understands, and can therefore fully sympathise with, anyone else.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">3. When we realise we are crazy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is deeply counter-intuitive. We seem so normal and mostly so good. It’s the others…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But maturity is founded on an active sense of one’s folly. One is out of control for long periods, one has failed to master one’s past, one projects unhelpfully, one is permanently anxious. One is, to put it mildly, an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If we are not regularly and very deeply embarrassed about who we are, it can only be because we have a dangerous capacity for selective memory.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">4. When we are ready to love rather than be loved </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Confusingly, we speak of ‘love’ as one thing, rather than discerning the two very different varieties that lie beneath the single word: being loved and loving. We should marry when we are ready to do the latter and are aware of our unnatural, immature fixation on the former.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We start out knowing only about ‘being loved.’ It comes to seem – very wrongly – like the norm. To the child, it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand to comfort, guide, entertain, feed, clear up and remain almost always warm and cheerful. Parents don’t reveal how often they have bitten their tongue, fought back the tears and been too tired to take off their clothes after a day of childcare. The relationship is almost entirely non-reciprocal. The parent loves; but they do not expect the favour to be returned in any significant way. The parent does not get upset when the child has not noticed the new hair cut, asked carefully-calibrated questions about how the meeting at work went or suggested that they go upstairs to take a nap. Parent and child may both ‘love’, but each party is on a very different end of the axis, unbeknownst to the child.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1635" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/176501414.jpg" alt="Bormes-les-Mimosas (Cote d'Azur, French Riviera)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is why in adulthood, when we first say we long for love, what we predominantly mean is that we want to be loved as we were once loved by a parent. We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be ministered to and indulged. In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want, be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, act selflessly and make it all better.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is – naturally – a disaster. For a marriage to work, we need to move firmly out of the child – and into the parental position. We need to become someone who will be willing to subordinate their own demands and concerns to the needs of another.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There’s a further lesson to be learnt. When a child says to its parent ‘I hate you’, the parent does not automatically go numb with shock or threaten to leave the house and never come back, because the parent knows that the child is not giving the executive summary of a deeply thought-out and patient investigation into the state of the relationship. The cause of these words might be hunger, a lost but crucial piece of Lego, the fact that they went to a cocktail party last night, that they won’t let them play a computer game, or that they have an earache…</p>
<p class="p1">Parents become very good at not hearing the explicit words and listening instead to what the child means but doesn’t yet know how to say: ‘I’m lonely, in pain, or frightened’ – distress which then unfairly comes out as an attack on the safest, kindest, most reliable thing in the child’s world: the parent.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We find it exceptionally hard to make this move with our partners: to hear what they truly mean, rather than responding (furiously) to what they are saying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A third vow should state: ‘Whenever I have the strength in me to do so, I will imitate those who once loved me and take care of my partner as these figures cared for me. The task isn’t an unfair chore or a departure from the true nature of love. It is the only kind of love really worthy of that exalted word.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">5. When we are ready for administration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic person instinctively sees marriage in terms of emotions. But what a couple actually get up to together over a lifetime has much more in common with the workings of a small business. They must draw up work rosters, clean, chauffeur, cook, fix, throw away, mind, hire, fire, reconcile and budget.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">None of these activities have any glamour whatsoever within the current arrangement of society. Those obliged to do them are therefore highly likely to resent them and feel that something has gone wrong with their lives for having to involve themselves so closely with them. And yet these tasks are what is truly ‘romantic’ in the sense of ‘conducive and sustaining of love’ and should be interpreted as the bedrock of a successful marriage, and accorded all the honour currently given to other activities in society, like mountain climbing or motor sport.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1636" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1923778a.jpg" alt="Mid adult man looking at iron over colored background" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A central vow should read: ‘I accept the dignity of the ironing board.’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">6. When we understand that sex and love do and don’t belong together</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic view expects that love and sex will be aligned. But in truth, they won’t stay so beyond a few months or, at best, one or two years. This is not anyone’s fault. Because marriage has other key concerns (companionship, administration, another generation), sex will suffer. We are ready to get married when we accept a large degree of sexual resignation and the task of sublimation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Both parties must therefore scrupulously avoid making the marriage ‘about sex’. They must also, from the outset, plan for the most challenging issue that will, statistically-speaking, arise for them: that one or the other will have affairs. Someone is properly ready for marriage when they are ready to behave maturely around betraying and being betrayed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The inexperienced, immature view of betrayal goes like this: sex doesn’t have to be part of love. It can be quick and meaningless, just like playing tennis. Two people shouldn’t try to own each other’s bodies. It’s just a bit of fun. So one’s partner shouldn’t mind so much.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1637" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3364132.jpg" alt="Jealous Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But this is wilfully to ignore impregnable basics of human nature. No one can be the victim of adultery and not feel that they have been found fundamentally wanting and cut to the core of their being. They will never get over it. It makes no sense, of course, but that isn’t the point. Many things about us make little sense – and yet have to be respected. The adulterer has to be ready to honour and forgive the partner’s extreme capacity for jealousy, and so must as far as is possible resist the urge to have sex with other people, must take every possible measure to prevent it being known if they do and must respond with extraordinary kindness and patience if the truth does ever emerge. They should above all never try to persuade their partner that it isn’t right to be jealous or that jealousy is unnatural, ‘bad’ or a bourgeois construct.</span></p>
<p class="p1">On the other side of the equation, one should ready oneself for betrayal. That is, one should make strenuous efforts to try to understand what might go through the partner’s mind when they have sex with someone else. One is likely to think that there is no other option but that they are deliberately trying to humiliate one and that all their love has evaporated. The more likely truth – that one’s partner just wants to have more, or different, sex – is as hard to master as Mandarin or the oboe and requires as much practice.</p>
<p class="p1">One is ready to get married when two very difficult things are in place: one is ready to believe in one’s partner’s genuine capacity to separate love and sex. And at the same time, one is ready to believe in one’s partner’s stubborn inability to keep love and sex apart.</p>
<p class="p1">Two people have to be able to master both feats, because they may – over a lifetime – be called upon to demonstrate both capacities. This – rather than a vow never to have sex with another human again – should be the relevant test for getting married.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">7. When we are happy to be taught and calm about teaching</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are ready for marriage when we accept that in certain very significant areas, our partners will be wiser, more reasonable and more mature than we are. We should want to learn from them. We should bear having things pointed out to us. We should, at key points, see them as the teacher and ourselves as pupils. At the same time, we should be ready to take on the task of teaching them certain things and like good teachers, not shout, lose our tempers or expect them simply to know. Marriage should be recognised as a process of mutual education.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">8. When we realise we’re not that compatible</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of marriage stresses that the ‘right’ person means someone who shares our tastes, interests and general attitudes to life. This might be true in the short term. But, over an extended period of time, the relevance of this fades dramatically; because differences inevitably emerge. The person who is truly best suited to us is not the person who shares our tastes, but the person who can negotiate differences in taste intelligently and wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rather than some notional idea of perfect complementarity, it is the capacity to tolerate difference that is the true marker of the ‘right’ person. Compatibility is an achievement of love; it shouldn’t be its precondition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion </span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have accepted that it is a truly good idea to attend some classes before having children. This is now the norm for all educated people in all developed nations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1638" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3369718.jpg" alt="Healthy Marriage Initiative Classes Held In Pennsylvania" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Yet there is as yet no widespread acceptability for the idea of having classes before getting married. The results are around for all to see.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The time has come to bury the Romantic intuition-based view of marriage and learn to practice and rehearse marriage as one would ice-skating or violin playing, activities no more complex and no more deserving of systematic periods of instruction.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For now, while the infrastructure of new vows and classes is put in place, we all deserve untold sympathy for our struggles. We are trying to do something enormously difficult without the bare minimum of support necessary. It is not surprising if – very often – we have troubles.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1707" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/114450365.jpg" alt="CZECH AND SLOVAK REPUBLIC OUT --- CZECH" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You try to set aside a special evening every now and then. That would have been absurd in the old days, you were alone so much of the time, but now there’s a need to make it artificial and schedule it in the diary way ahead of time. Which means – sadly – the pressure is greater.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At first, it feels rather strange to be out, just the two of you. It can be hard to know how to get started. Obviously there are so many vital things you need to say to one another, but they can be elusive. You look carefully at the design of the wine glass. It seems to be Scandinavian. You mention that the colour of the menu is unusual. Your partner comments that it looked like it was going to be difficult parking – which, it turns out, it wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to have a ‘Romantic’ conception of conversation. We believe that in the right setting – distressed old wooden tables, food from Liguria, bruschetta – conversation will flow naturally, without special effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reality is that conversation is an achievement, something we might need to learn. This point belongs to a bigger argument about emotional education. We do not spontaneously or naturally possess many of the skills we need in order to cope adequately with the demands of psychological life. There is much we should learn about love, work, ageing, family life, self-control, but on the whole modern societies have not provided education of this kind, or even seen it as desirable. They have unconsciously been guided by the likes of Jean Jacques Rousseau, who thought of artifice (rules we learn around emotional functioning) as fundamental obstacles to real intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1708" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/159827991.jpg" alt="Portrait of Jean-Jacques Rousseau" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Not keen on rules about how to talk to your lover</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we should not feel that we are a failure, dull-witted, unimaginative or unsophisticated if we recognise a theoretical need to learn how to talk to our partners with premeditation and conscious purpose. We are simply emerging from a Romantic prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1709" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2372729e.jpg" alt="BEFORE MIDNIGHT - Jan 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, therefore, is an attempt at a conversational menu, questions to raise as the meal unfolds, and designed to unlock certain chambers of our hearts:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you most like to be complimented on in the relationship? Where do you think you’re especially good as a person?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Which of your flaws do you want to be treated more generously?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the start of a relationship, there’s an exciting period when you are getting to know one another. One evening you hear all about the partner’s cousin – whose existence you hadn’t even suspected. Another time they tell you of their French holidays during adolescence. Then things settle down. You come to feel you know each other through and through. Yet this is necessarily always simply a failure of imagination. Every life is inexhaustibly interesting. Here are some follow-on suggestions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you tell your younger self about love?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What do I get wrong about you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is one incident you would like to apologise to me for?  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is one incident you would like me to apologise to you for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s perhaps time for the main course now, a chance to deepen matters further:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Finish the following sentences:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I am anxious in our relationship, I tend to….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You then tend to respond by….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which makes me…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we argue, on the surface I show ……, but inside I feel….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The more I ….., the more you….. and then the more I….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If I was magically offered a chance to change something about you, what do you guess it would be?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What would you want to change about me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How have I let you down?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without thinking too hard, let’s finish these sentence stems about our feelings towards one another:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I resent…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am puzzled by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am hurt by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I regret…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am afraid that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am frustrated by…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am happier when…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I want…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I appreciate…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I hope…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I would so like you to understand…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s getting late. A chance to try out a few final enquiries:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you could write an instruction manual for yourself in bed, what would you put in it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both take a piece of paper and write down three new things you would like to try around sex. Exchange.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships founder on our inability to make ourselves known and forgiven for who we are. We shouldn’t work with the assumption that if we have a row over these questions, the evening has been wasted. We need to be able to say certain painful things in order to recover an ability to be affectionate and trusting. That is all part of the particular wisdom and task of a more structured and emotionally-conscious date night.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">President Obama was out the other week inspecting the navy at the largest US mainland base in Norfolk, Virginia. A month ago, he was out at the Wright-Patterson air force base in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can look rather impressive. He’s in charge. The generals have to do what he says, and they will. Around the world, the tanks, the aircraft carriers, the fighter planes and the combat troops are all waiting for his orders.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2080" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyA.jpg" alt="PM-140314-daddyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so painfully aware of what can go wrong when power is abused that we tell ourselves we never like authority. Yet there are important parts of ourselves that want to feel protected; we want someone to be there to anticipate danger, someone to stand in the front line and to confront whatever threats and harms may be lurking in the wider world with a tone of authority and command.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maturity has unfairly come to be associated with an overcoming of all emotions connected to being passive or submissive towards others. So we think that if we are to pass muster as plausibly smart and worldly we have to stress how free we are of any desire to have politicians as guardians of our safety, as father (or mother) figures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One way this is expressed is as a reluctance to admire politicians. Admiration is an admission of inequality and of need – it puts you in a vulnerable position. When you admire someone you look up to them, you recognise they can do something you can’t. You might wish you could do it but in admiration you’re honest enough to admit their superiority.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2081" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyB.jpg" alt="Obama 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lodged at the back of our minds are deeply traumatic images of enthusiasm for authority going catastrophically wrong. We think that if we like authority at all we are only a hair’s breadth away from turning into Nazis. This is such a horrible prospect that we understandably want to signal to ourselves and everyone else how very very far we are from it. Trauma (in this case the world’s collective psychological wounds from the 1930s and 40s) means we get terrified by actually perfectly decent things that unfortunately put us in mind of a nightmare we’ve gone through already.</span></p>
<p class="p2">But we need to reassure ourselves of the huge safety margins between admiring authority – wanting to be protected and looked after – and the hysterical worship of a dictator. These two things are not remotely the same. They only look connected because the historical aftershocks are still with us.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s time to recover our confidence; admiration for authority is not always a disaster, indeed it has a role to play in a functioning state.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2082" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-140314-daddyC.jpg" alt="Germany Adolf Hitler Troop Review" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The nightmare really is over</span></h5>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Of course, we expect it to be the other way around: we teaching them. But they have a host of important lessons for us too, if we dare to pay close enough attention.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong>1. We’re dependent creatures</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to play it tough now, to overdo our autonomy and independence. But to have survived, we all had to be recipients of continuous exhaustive ministration and attention, at all hours and in multiple ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies are a reminder that no one made themselves. And therefore, that we’re heavily in someone’s debt (and should – perhaps – call our mother).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project11.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4449" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project11.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="Mary_Cassatt_-_The_Childs_Bath_-_Google_Art_Project1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. What love is</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As adults, we give love chiefly because of what others can do for us: entertain us, charm our eyes, explain things, soothe us…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies don’t deserve much of anything from this point of view. They can do nothing at all for us (there’s no ‘point’ to them, as slightly older children sometimes say), they have little to talk about and are asleep for a lot of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we help them nevertheless. They, in turn, teach us about the truest, purest, ego-free kind of love, which is about giving affection without an expectation of receiving anything in return, but simply because someone else needs help – and we are in a position to give it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/113087458_81cdbe12dc_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8884" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/113087458_81cdbe12dc_o.jpg?resize=550%2C607" alt="113087458_81cdbe12dc_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. People are usually tired and scared; not mean</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They can’t – of course – tell us what is wrong with them. We have to guess – and what’s striking is how generous we are in our interpretation of what is going on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When they cry, we don’t accuse them of being mean or self-pitying. When they hit or kick, we assume they must just be frightened or momentarily vexed. We are constantly aware of just how much the workings of hunger, a tricky digestive tract or a lack of sleep may affect human character.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How helpful it would be if we were more often able to apply a similar method of interpretation around adults. How kind we would be if we could look beneath the surface behaviour – the unpleasantness, viciousness and desperate grumpiness – and see that what could really be going on is just confusion, fear and exhaustion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8767955537_4b053bafa8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8885" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8767955537_4b053bafa8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="8767955537_4b053bafa8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. We have more in common than we think</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the simplest truth: we were all babies once. It’s an especially alien thought in the context of people we find weird or off-putting. The tramp, the maniac, the thief. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They all once started off in exactly the same place as us. However different we may all be now, we share a common heritage – and there is therefore always material to hand from which a sense of identification – and a measure of compassion – can arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. No one is that scary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Others may be impressive and frightening now, but they were all once tiny and fragile and retain some of that early vulnerability somewhere beneath their armour. It’s a basic levelling democratic thought, like the idea that everyone, even the very important, serious and wealthy, have to visit a bathroom every few hours.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<h6 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19650368_ad5e5c496e_o-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8886" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/19650368_ad5e5c496e_o-1.jpg?resize=550%2C606" alt="19650368_ad5e5c496e_o (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. There is hope</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s easy to get sickened by our species: the greed, the status consciousness, the vanity…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we should hang out with babies as a corrective; they don’t care if the car is big, they don’t pay attention to what one’s job is or how much one’s making.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They care about the fundamentals: cuddles, laughter, friendship, being with people who are nice to them whatever they look like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Deep down, we’re perhaps all like this. It’s society that corrupts us and encourages the wrong impulses.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Babies are on the side of utopian politics. They argue that the world should be different from the way it is now. They’re messengers of hope. Each one is an example of how we might all be, if only our societies could be differently and better arranged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. They are artists</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They correct some of our disenchantment and boredom, for they are pleased by ostensibly ‘minor’ but important things. A cup with a peculiar sort of lid. A flower. A puddle. The sunlight on the carpet. The taste of milk. Things that have become boring to us – unfairly so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Vermeer, Renoir, Proust, Tolstoy all knew how to renew our enthusiasm for minor things. Babies are not so different, and deserve a little of the respect we naturally find ourselves giving great artists.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8867" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5383445152_af2f0d9a8b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet that is to be unstrategic about a major cultural resource. A novel is a machine for simulating experience, a ‘life simulator’ and – like its flight equivalent – it allows us safely to experience what it might – in real life – take us years and great danger to go through. Unaided, we are puny in our powers of empathy and comprehension, isolated from the inner lives of others, limited in our experiences, short of time, and able to encounter only a tiny portion of the world first hand. Fiction extends our range – it takes us inside the intimate consciousness of strangers, it lets us sit in on experiences that would be terrifying or reckless in reality; it lends us more lives than we have been given.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are three ways in particular in which novels deliver their assistance:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As cautionary tales:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They give us early warnings. They alert us to dangers that we’re not adept at recognising: where envy might lead us, what indifference can do to a relationship, where lust can drive us… They trace the links between apparently minor errors of personality and the monumental catastrophes they can unleash, in the hope that by showing us the pitfalls, our own tendencies to disaster and folly may be curbed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As maps of progress:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fiction provides models of development, demonstrations of triumph over difficulties, case studies in maturation and the acquisition of wisdom. We are carefully taken through ways in which certain people have learned, perhaps over many years and with much pain, how to cope with problems which are, in some ways, also our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">As exhortations:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many good things which we may have not known close-up but which we would benefit from experiencing – and which fiction can create for us. It can show us a couple who have understood how to resolve their difficulties with grace and humour, a father who can be at once authoritative and kind; a politician who has overcome vanity and tribal interests. It’s not simply that we need to know there are such people at large. It’s that by spending time in their company, the more admirable sides of human nature have an opportunity to rub off on us a little.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-666" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blue.jpg" alt="Blue is the Warmest Colour - 22 Aug 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, there are too many bad novels out there – by which one means, novels that do not give us a correct map of love, that leave us unprepared to deal adequately with the difficulties of being in a couple. In moments of acute distress in relationships, our grief is too often complicated by a sense that things have become, for us alone, unusually and perversely difficult. Not only are we suffering, but it seems that our suffering has no equivalent in the lives of other more or less sane people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our attitudes to our own love lives are in large part formed by the tradition of the Romantic novel (which nowadays is advanced not only in literary fiction but in video, music and advertising). The narrative arts of the Romantic novel have unwittingly constructed a devilish template of expectations of what relationships are supposed to be like – in the light of which our own love lives often look grievously and deeply unsatisfying. We break up or feel ourselves cursed in significant part because we are exposed to the wrong works of literature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If this ‘wrong’ kind is to be termed Romantic, then the right kind – of which there are so few – might be deemed Classical. Here are some of the differences:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">THE PLOT</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> In the archetypal Romantic novel, the drama hinges entirely on how a couple get together: the ‘love story’ is no such thing, it is merely the account of how love begins. All sorts of obstacles are placed in the way of love’s birth, and the interest lies in watching their steady overcoming: there might be misunderstandings, bad luck, prejudice, war, a rival, a fear of intimacy, or – most poignantly – shyness… But in the end, after tribulations, the right people will eventually get into couples. Love begins – and the story must end.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> This wiser, less immediately seductive genre knows that the real problem isn’t finding a partner, it is tolerating them, and being tolerated, over time. It knows that the start of relationships is not the high point that Romantic culture assumes; it is merely the first step of a far longer, more ambivalent and yet quietly far more heroic journey – on which it directs its intelligence and scrutiny.</p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sofa.jpg" alt="Weekend - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">WORK</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> The characters may have jobs but on the whole they have little impact on their psyches. Work goes on somewhere else. What one does for a living is not thought relevant to an understanding of love.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-668" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/beautifullaunderette.jpg" alt="'My Beautiful Launderette' Film - 1985" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> But here we see that work is in fact a huge part of life, with an overwhelming role in shaping our relationships. Whatever our emotional dispositions, it is the stress of work that ends up generating a sizeable share of the trouble lovers will have with each other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CHILDREN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> Children are incidental, sweet symbols of mutual love, or naughty in an endearing way. They rarely cry, take up little time and are generally wise, exhibiting a native, unschooled intelligence.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kids-1.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> We see that relationships are fundamentally oriented towards the having and raising of children – and at the same time, that children place the couple under unbearable strains. They kill the passion that made them possible. Life moves from the sublime to the quotidian. There are toys in the living room, pieces of chicken under the table, and no time to talk. Everyone is always tired. This too is love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">PRACTICALITIES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> In this genre, we have only a hazy idea of who does the housework. It is not seen as relevant to a relationship. Domesticity is a corrupting force and people who care a lot about it are likely to be unhappy in their relationships. We are unlikely to learn a great deal concerning a couple’s thinking on homework or television for the under fours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/315659445_23870cf7ec_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8868" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/315659445_23870cf7ec_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="315659445_23870cf7ec_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> Here relationships are understood to be institutions, not just emotions. Part of their rationale is to enable two people to function as a joint economic unit for the education of the next generation. This is in no way banal. There are opportunities for genuine heroism. Especially around laundry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SEX</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> Sex and love are shown to belong together. The high point of love is intercourse. Adultery, in the romantic view, is therefore fatal: if you were with the right person you could never be unfaithful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> It knows that long-term love may not set up the best preconditions for sex. The classical attitude sees love and sex as distinct and at times divergent themes in life. And therefore sexual problems do not in themselves indicate that a relationship is, overall, a disaster…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">COMPATIBILITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Romantic novel:</strong> The Romantic novel cares about the harmony (or lack of it) between the souls of the protagonists. It believes that the fundamental challenge of romantic life is to find someone who completely understands us and with whom there need never be any more secrets. It believes that love is finding your other half, your spiritual twin. Love is not about training or education, it is an instinct, a feeling – and is generally mysterious in its workings.</span></p>
<h6 class="p1"><span class="s1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-671" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marriage.jpg" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Classical novel:</strong> It accepts that no one ever fully understands anyone else; that there must be secrets, that there will be loneliness, that there must be compromise. It believes that we have to learn how to sustain good relationships, that there are learnable skills, and that love is not just a chance endowment of nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic novel is deeply unhelpful. We have learned to judge ourselves by the hopes and expectations fostered by a misleading medium. By its standards, our own relationships are almost all damaged and unsatisfactory. No wonder separation or divorce so often appear to be inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They shouldn’t be, we merely need to change our reading matter: to tell ourselves more accurate stories about the progress of relationships, stories that normalise troubles and show us an intelligent, helpful path through them.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s tempting to think of marriage as old fashioned. Why not just live with someone and be done with it? What need for a public ceremony? Why the weird traditions that people normally keep away from: all those churches, temples, hymns, vows and prayers? Marriage must be a silly relic from the religious childhood of humankind, not designed for the more logical modern world.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1176" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bride.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it survives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The essence of marriage is to tie our hands, to frustrate our wills, to put high and costly obstacles in the way of splitting up. Why do we do this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originally, we told ourselves that God wanted us to stay married. But even now, when God is not invoked, we keeping making sure that marriage is rather hard to undo. For one thing, you carefully invite everyone you know to watch you say you’ll stick together. You willingly create a huge layer of embarrassment were you ever to turn round and admit it might have been a mistake. Furthermore, even though you could keep things separate, marriage tends to mean deep economic and legal entanglements. You know it is going to take the work of a phalanx of accountants and lawyers to prise you apart. It can be done, of course, but it will be ruinous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is as if we somewhere recognise that there might, rather strangely, be some quite good, though uncomfortable, reasons why making it difficult to split up a union can be an advantage for its members.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Impulse is dangerous</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Marshmallow Test was a celebrated experiment in the history of psychology designed to measure children’s ability to delay gratification – and track the consequences of being able to think long-term. Some three-year-old children were offered a marshmallow, but told they would get two if they held off from eating the first one for five minutes. It turned out a lot of children just couldn’t make it through this period. It was too tempting; the less immediate benefit of gobbling the marshmallow in front of them was stronger than the strategy of waiting. Crucially, it was observed that these children went on to have lives blighted by a lack of impulse control, and fared much worse than the children who were best at subordinating immediate fun for long-term benefit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1177" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4941627622_44d7178727_z.jpg" alt="4941627622_44d7178727_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships are no different. Here too, many things feel very urgent. Not eating marshmallows, but escaping, finding freedom, running away… We’re angry and want to get out. We’re excited by a new person and want to abandon our present partner at once. And yet as we look around for the exit, every way seems blocked. It would cost a fortune, it would be so embarrassing, it would take an age.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t a coincidence. Marriage is a giant inhibitor of impulse set up by our conscience to keep our libidinous, optimistic, desiring self in check. What we are essentially buying into by submitting to its dictates is the insight that we are (as individuals) likely to make very poor choices under the sway of strong short-term impulses. To marry is to recognise that we require structure to insulate us from our urges. It is to lock ourselves up willingly, because we somehow acknowledge the benefits of the long-term.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1178" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wine.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage proceeds without constant reference to the moods of its protagonists. It isn’t about feeling. It is a declaration of intent that it is crucially impervious to our day-to-day desires. It is a very unusual marriage in which the two people don’t spend a notable amount of time fantasising that they weren’t in fact married. But the point of marriage is to make these feelings not matter very much. It is an arrangement that protects us from what we desire and yet know (in our more reasonable moments) we don’t truly need or want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We grow and develop gradually</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At their best, relationships involve us in attempts to develop, mature and become ‘whole’. We often get drawn to people precisely because they promise to edge us in the right direction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the process of our maturation can be agonisingly slow and complicated. We spend long periods (decades perhaps) blaming the other person for problems which arise from our own weakness. We resist attempts at being changed, asking to be loved ‘for who we are’, with all our faults – as if this could ever be a good idea…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can take years of supportive interest; many tearful moments of anxiety, much frustration, until genuine progress can be made. With time, after maybe 120 arguments on a single topic, both parties may begin to see it from the other’s point of view. Slowly we start to get insights into our own madness. We find labels for our issues, we give each other maps of our difficult areas, we become a little easier to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/feathers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4485" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/feathers.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="Woman comforting man smoking pipe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It is too easy to seem kind and normal when we go out with someone new. The truth about us, on the basis of which self-improvement can begin, only becomes clear over time. Chances of development increase hugely when we don’t keep running away to people who will falsely reassure us that there’s nothing too wrong with us.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Investment requires security</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of the most worthwhile projects require immense sacrifices from both parties, and it’s in the nature of such sacrifices that we’re most likely to make them for people who are also making them for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage is a means by which people can specialise – perhaps in making money or in running a home. This can be hugely constructive. But it carries a risk. Each person (especially if one person stays at home) needs to be assured that they will not later be disadvantaged by this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage sets up the conditions in which we can take decisions about what to do with our lives that would otherwise be too risky.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">** **</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Over time, the argument for marriage has shifted. It’s no longer about external forces having power over us: churches, the state, the legal idea of legitimacy, the social idea of being respectable…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we are correctly now focused on is the psychological point of making it hard to throw it all in. It turns out that we benefit greatly (though at a price) from having to stick with certain commitments, because some of our key needs have a long-term structure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the last fifty years, the burden of intelligent effort has been on attempting to make separation easier. The challenge now lies in another direction: in trying to remind ourselves why immediate flight doesn’t always make sense; in trying to see the point of holding out for the second marshmallow.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You are queuing to go through to Departures; one of the guards at security has lovely, almost turquoise eyes. You are intrigued by the way they’re frisking the occasional passenger. There’s a charming, sceptical smile hovering over their lips. You’re hoping they might pick you. One side of your mind is, without authority, racing ahead with scenarios that have no place in a busy, sensible life.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/security.jpg" alt="Passengers wait at Lyon's airport, south" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re in your sixties, a mother of three, a manager at a large corporation. At the beach, you notice a group of young men playing volleyball. Your eyes almost involuntarily scan their muscular, tanned bodies and you realise you are appreciating their athleticism and youth more than seems normal. You turn back to your book, a little confused and ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1151" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/volleyball.jpg" alt="Men play volleyball on the beach below Sugar Loaf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">You’re on a train and notice the passenger opposite. You really like that kind of hair: tousled and thick but quite short at the sides. They’ve got very interesting glasses and you can just see the collar of their leather jacket. For you, this has always been a deeply alluring mix. You think about the rest of their body; you imagine somehow sparking a conversation, building a connection and retreating to the bathroom at the end of the carriage…</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1152" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trainwindow.jpg" alt="Landscape From TGV" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Are you – or, even worse, are you increasingly<em> becoming</em> – a bit of a ‘sleazebag’? The possibility can be concerning and appalling. Our era is deeply alive to the dangers of unreciprocated desire, particularly in their exploitative, hierarchical forms: moments when a person uses their position or power to disregard the wishes and humanity of others, and treats them instrumentally, for their own gratification alone.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The terror of this sort of infringement is easily awoken when desire is sparked by strangers who – most likely (for this is the way things can be expected to go, statistically-speaking) – have absolutely no interest in us, and might even be shocked, and sickened, to know our thoughts. Dealing with shame at the possibility of lechery belongs (in a small way) to the art of living wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To begin with, the very fact we have this worry is rather a good sign. To be concerned that one’s desires may be harmful or disturbing to another person is a signal of a basic moral sense and, as such, is a vital safeguard and inhibition that one would never want to be without. Truly exploitative people rarely agonise that they might be such a thing. The erotic fantasy isn’t a prelude to forcing one’s unsolicited attention on another person: it is (almost always) a mature admission that nothing is going to happen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lechery belongs to the larger family of daydreams, that is, wishes that one’s life were richer in possibilities than it is. To be more sympathetic to ourselves, almost everyone has daydreams, for our lives are necessarily incomplete and daydreaming is a highly creative and useful response to profound inadequacy and lack.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The inventor of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, made an instructive observation about babies and daydreams. Imagine a baby who wakes up in the middle of the night. It’s dark and the mother isn’t there and it starts crying. It’s going to take a few minutes before the mother can come along and see what’s the matter. In those few minutes, the baby is alone with its distress. To an adult, it might not seem a long time, but to an infant the delay could be devastating. In a healthy scenario, the baby pulls off a remarkable feat: it is able to imagine the mother being there even when she isn’t; the baby fantasises that it’s not alone, that things are better than they are. And that can be enough to hold things together for a while. Fantasy comes to the rescue when there aren’t better options.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/daydream.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4438" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/daydream.jpg?resize=635%2C592" alt="A girl daydreaming during class.  (Photo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">We should take a modest leaf from Freud’s insight. Even if our lives are OK, we really are missing out on an awful lot. We can only enjoy a few possibilities. We will appeal to only a very few of the people who appeal to us. It would be dishonest to say such things aren’t extremely painful.</p>
<p class="p2">Daydreaming is a safety net that stops us going crazy from a sense of missing out. Rather than worrying only about the risks of escapism and unwanted lechery, we should be equally concerned about what happens when people don’t have daydreams. It is the inability to fantasise that can lead people to act out, rather than, dream their wishes. Fantasy is a critical safety valve. It’s a frank admission of the goodness and appeal of so much that one hasn’t got.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And perhaps we can get more ambitious about the area in which being a sleazebag sits: the field of empathy and imaginative involvement. We call it lechery in part to draw attention to an (unwanted) erotic component. But the act of wondering about someone else can potentially extend more broadly into speculations about what another person might be like, how they might act, how they might respond, how they would speak, what they would feel… – things that are, in themselves, far more holistic and less threatening and offensive. We are in a broad sense far more curious than daily life allows us to be. We always have more thoughts about others than propriety allows us to share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is in part why we have novels. We think of the novel as a kind of art not because it avoids sex and erotic experience but because it joins up erotic excitement with a broader interest in who strangers are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we fear we are sleazebags (as occasionally we must), the wise response shouldn’t be to try to suppress all imaginings about other people. Instead, it should be to expand upon our fantasies in the security of our minds – and honour our daydreams for what they are: melancholy, slightly pitiful, highly normal, but clever ways of coping.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are – when you start adding incidents up – rather a lot of things about you that your partner seems keen to change. They notice how you put off ringing your mother. They want you to be more adventurous in how you dress. Three times recently they said they want you to get a grip on your finances. They’ve also hinted they’d like you to take more of an interest in the children’s homework and to help to host more dinner parties. It doesn’t feel very pleasant. But, then again, they’re not alone: if you are honest with yourself, there is plenty about them that you would – ideally – like to change as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108432305.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4377" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108432305.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Ignoring The Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This all feels very wrong. The impulse to alter our lovers appears to run counter to the spirit of love. If we loved and were loved, surely there wouldn’t be any talk of change? Isn’t love about the acceptance of an entire being, in their high and low points?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of wanting to change our partners sounds incongruous and disturbing because, collectively, we have been deeply influenced by a Romantic conception of love. This states that the principal marker of love is the capacity to accept another person in their totality, in all their good and bad sides – and in a sense, particularly their bad sides. To love someone is, quite simply, according to Romantic philosophy, to love them <b><i>as they are</i></b> – without any wish to alter them. We must embrace the whole person to be worthy of the emotion we claim to feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At certain moments of love, it does feel particularly poignant and moving to be loved for things that others have condemned us for or not seen the point of. It can seem the ultimate proof of love that the trickier sides of us can arouse interest, charity and even desire. Through life, we are always conscious that there are things about us that other people might not like very much – and we try to protect ourselves from scorn and criticism. What excitement then when our lovers seem to treat certain failings generously. When they find you shy at parties, they don’t laugh – they are sweet and take your tongue-tiedness as a sign of sincerity. They’re not embarrassed by your slightly unfashionable clothes, for them, it’s about honesty and the strength to ignore public opinion. When you have a hangover, they don’t say it was your own fault  for drinking too much; they rub your neck, bring you tea and keep the curtains closed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From these moments, an extremely unfortunate conviction develops around love: the idea that loving someone must always mean accepting them in every area – and that being loved must invariably mean being endorsed for everything one is and does. Any desire for change must, according to this Romantic ideology, arouse upset, annoyance and deep resistance. It seems proof that there can’t be love, that something has gone terribly wrong – that one should break up…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is another more workable and mature philosophy of love available, this one traceable back to the ancient Greeks. It states that love is first and foremost an admiration for the good sides, the perfections, of another human being. Love is the excitement we feel when we come face to face with something that is strong, clever, kind, honest, witty or magnanimous in another person. The Greeks took the view that love is not an obscure emotion. To love someone is not an odd chemical phenomenon indescribable in words. It just means being awed by another person for all the sort of things about them that truly are right and accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508916311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4374" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508916311.jpg?resize=635%2C373" alt="Restoration Work Completed On Michelangelo's David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, what do we do with weaknesses, the problems, the not-so-nice bits? The Romantic philosophy tells us to embrace, even cherish them – all of them. We do this with a certain number of them: a relationship wouldn’t get off the ground if we couldn’t. But at a certain point, we reach our limit. Being told we simply have to love someone for all that they are, or else think of ourselves as bad people, is asking too much. How could someone never want to change any part of us if they know us properly? Do they lack all ambition for our true potential? Do we not ourselves aspire to change and improvement? Then why blame them for wanting from us what we at heart want from ourselves?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this point, the Greek idea of love turns to a notion to which we desperately need to rehabilitate ourselves: <b><i>education</i></b>. For the Greeks, given that we are all very imperfect, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach – and to be taught. Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. When lovers teach each other uncomfortable truths, they are not giving up on love. They are trying to do something very true to love: which is to make their partners more loveable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1644" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/665623.jpg" alt="Bronx School Stands Out" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners, and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us. Both these projects are, in theory, highly legitimate, even necessary. The desire to put one’s lover right is, in fact, utterly loyal to the essential task of love – to help another person to become the best version of themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, under the sway of Romantic ideology, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students. That’s because we don’t accept that it’s legitimate (let alone noble) to have things we might want to teach and areas where we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover’s education that would enable criticism to be moulded into sensible-sounding lessons and to be heard as caring attempts to rejig our troublesome personalities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, in the student role, at the first sign that the other is adopting a pedagogical tone (maybe pointing out something that we said rather too loudly at dinner, or a habit that is cropping up again at work), we tend to assume that we are being ‘attacked’ and betrayed – and therefore close our ears to the instruction, reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3199681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4372" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3199681.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Deaf Musicians" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Correspondingly, when there is something we would like to teach, so unsure are we that we’re going to be heard (we develop experience of how these things usually go) or that we have the right to speak, our lessons tend to come out in a tone of hurried annoyance. We are frightened teachers, because we recognise that we have committed ourselves to pupils who don’t even want to learn and in the process, are ruining our lives as well as theirs (most pupils don’t have as much power over their teachers’ lives as they do in the Romantic scenario, which is why they are generally better). What might have been an opportunity for a thoughtful lesson will come out – under the panicky, scared ‘classroom’ conditions of the average relationship – as a series of shouted, belittling insults met with by rebellion and fury by the student body. We don’t use any of the techniques that we are careful to use when trying to teach a child or a colleague. Here we know to use extraordinary tact, to make ten compliments for every one negative remark, to leave ourselves plenty of time… But in love’s classroom, we are the worst teachers we are ever likely to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we should stop judging these faulty attempts at instruction so harshly. Rather than reading every lesson as an assault on our whole being, as a sign we are about to be abandoned or humiliated, we should take it for what it is: an indication, however flawed, that someone can be bothered – even if they aren’t yet breaking the news perfectly (our friends are less critical not because they’re nicer, but because they don’t need to bother: they get to leave us behind after a few hours in a restaurant).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should never feel ashamed of instructing or of needing instruction. The only fault is to reject the opportunity for education if it is offered – however clumsily. Love should be a nurturing attempt by two people to reach their full potential – never just a crucible in which to look for endorsement for all one’s existing failings.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re flicking through a fashion magazine and playfully suggest that your partner might want to make a few experiments with their wardrobe. How about a different pair of jeans or a new T-shirt, a duffle coat or platform heels? But at the mention of this possibility, your partner gets very agitated indeed: they scornfully declare that money is tight, they haven’t got any time, they have too many clothes already and why are you deliberately annoying them by making vapid proposals like this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This response is very off-putting. You only made a perfectly reasonable suggestion and now they are declaring war. You didn’t do anything. Their behaviour seems utterly out of proportion with what triggered it. You may conclude, as you have done on other occasions, that in some areas the person you love really does seem ‘a bit mad.’ This conclusion, though perhaps depressing, also feels strangely satisfying. At least you know what is up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_948135a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4379" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_948135a.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="Couple having serious interaction" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we are all a ‘bit mad’ in ways that preclude such dismissive statements and demand closer and more generous examination. For all of us, there are situations and behaviours which can be counted upon to elicit swift and powerful responses which don’t seem in any way in line with what is happening right now. Our behaviour seems not to fit what is unfolding in front of us. For example, someone we love is going away for a month, and tells us they will miss us very much indeed. They move to hug us. But far from feeling sad and tender, we just register numbness, pull away and can’t say anything other than that the weather is unseasonably chilly today. Or we return home to find there is a bit of a mess in the kitchen, but rather than taking this in our stride, we start to shout at our partner that the house is chaos and life with them has become impossible. Or a friend is only ten minutes late for our birthday party, but we are compelled to send them a text calling them an a**hole and asking them not even to bother coming.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_1443467a-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4380" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_1443467a-1.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These sort of behaviours don’t make any sense if we try to justify them simply according to the facts in the here and now (as we and their perpetrators are inclined to do). The clue to them lies in something known as <em>transference</em> – a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature – that we cobbled together in childhood to meet a threat that we were at that time too vulnerable, immature and inexperienced to cope with properly. We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to what feels like a very familiar threat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy – and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is even distantly evocative of our earlier troubles. Perhaps a parent we loved left us for long periods to work abroad. They didn’t mean to but the pain was so intense at that time, we reacted by shutting down our capacities for affection. Our way of coping was not to feel, to grow numb – a response that we keep producing even now, 30 years later, whenever someone we love has to go away for a time. Or perhaps we had chaotic, unreliable parents whom we dealt with by rigidly organising our room, arranging books by size, and reacting with alarm at the slightest bit of dust – and even now, outer disorder ushers in a panicky feeling within that everything is out of control once again. Or we had a sister who was always late to events that mattered to us, or a mother who was both humiliating and obsessed by fashion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1652" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_519423ap.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unconscious mind is slow to realise that things have changed in the outer world but sadly quick to mistake one person for another, seeming to judge only by crude correspondences; ‘someone we love’ or ‘a person coming to our party’ appears to be enough to confuse us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because transference happens without us knowing it, we generally can’t explain why we are behaving as we are. We carry years behind us that have no discernible shape, which we have forgotten about and which we aren’t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We just come across as mean or mad. What we would ideally need is a guardian angel who can pause the present and carry our partners back to another time and place, to the moment when the neurotic defence that we are projecting originated. They’d be able to see the unreliable parents, the chaotic house, the loving but neglectful father, the fashion-obsessed mother etc. – and might be appropriately moved by what we had to cope with before we knew how to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3249794-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4381" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3249794-1.jpg?resize=635%2C335" alt="Pestalozzi Children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of transference – and the accompanying idea of projection – provide a vantage point on some of the most frustrating behaviours that we ever meet with in relationships. And they allow us to feel sympathy and understanding where we might have only felt irritation. If we cannot always be entirely sane in our relationships, the kindest thing we can do for those who care about us is to hand over some maps that try to chart and guide one through the more disturbed regions of our internal world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Transference Exercises </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Key to building up such maps is working out where transference might be occurring. For this, we can rely on ‘transference exercises.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most famous of these is the Rorschach test, devised in the 1930s by the psychologist Hermann Rorschach to help people to learn more about the contents of the hard-to-reach parts of their own minds. By being shown an ambiguous image and asked to say what it was, Rorschach believed that we would naturally reveal some of our latent guiding fears, hopes, prejudices and assumptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The important point in any Rorschach test is that the image has no one true meaning. Different people merely see different things in it according to what their past predisposes them to imagine. To one individual with a rather kindly and forgiving conscience, the image below could be seen as a sweet mask, with eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks. Another, more traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rorschach_blot_04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4383" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rorschach_blot_04.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="Rorschach_blot_04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or take another classic transference exercise:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Projection-Image.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5818" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Projection-Image.jpg?resize=255%2C359" alt="Projection Image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It’s key that this image is rather ambiguous. You can read it many different ways, and that’s the point: to make you aware of your characteristic instances of transference by teasing them out with an inconclusive image.</p>
<p class="p1">Of this image, people might say things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died.</li>
<li>It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee</li>
<li>Or: I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing we do know &#8211; really &#8211; is that the picture doesn’t show any of these things, it simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. <b>The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it.</b> And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. <b>This is what one means by transference.</b></p>
<p class="p1">A third transference exercise asks us to say the first thing that comes to mind when we try to finish certain sentences. For example:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Men are generally…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Women are almost always…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. When I fall in love, what’s bound to happen is…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. When someone I care about is late, it must be because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. The kitchen is in chaos, and it’s evidence that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. When I hear someone described as ‘very intellectual’, I imagine them being…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because these sentences aren’t about a concrete situation in the present, the only way to answer them is by calling up transferences from the past. Our responses hence give us a clue as to a bias in our minds that would normally be invisibly applied, merging imperceptibly with the dilemmas of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In good relationships, people are ready to accept that they might be involved in transference. Ideally, we should all rationally disentangle and un-distort our transferences and explain them to others in good time. But it rarely happens and collectively we pay a big price for our ignorance. We keep making things tough for everyone by over- and under-reacting – and so our relationships are far harder than they need to be.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4349" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="tumblr_n1k3ofLggB1qz9b3ko1_1280" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are introduced to someone at a conference. They look nice and you have a brief chat about the theme of the keynote speaker. But already, partly because of the slope of their neck and a lilt in their accent, you have reached an overwhelming conclusion. Or, you sit down in the carriage – and there, diagonally opposite you – is someone you cannot stop looking at for the rest of a journey across miles of darkening countryside. You know nothing concrete about them. You are going only by what their appearance suggests. You note that they have slipped a finger into a book (<i>The Food of the Middle East</i>), that their nails are bitten raw, that they have a thin leather strap around their left wrist and that they are squinting a touch short-sightedly at the map above the door. And that is enough to convince you. Another day, coming out of the supermarket, amidst a throng of people, you catch sight of a face for no longer than eight seconds and yet here too, you feel the same overwhelming certainty – and, subsequently, a bittersweet sadness at their disappearance in the anonymous crowd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Crushes: they happen to some people often and to almost everyone sometimes. Airports, trains, streets, conferences – the dynamics of modern life are forever throwing us into fleeting contact with strangers, from amongst whom we pick out a few examples who seem to us not merely interesting, but more powerfully, the solution to our lives. This phenomenon – the crush – goes to the heart of the modern understanding of love. It could seem like a small incident, essentially comic and occasionally farcical. It may look like a minor planet in the constellation of love, but it is in fact the underlying secret central sun around which our notions of the romantic revolve.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1659" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Lee-Friedlander-Revolving-Door-1963.jpg" alt="Lee-Friedlander-Revolving-Door-1963" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A crush represents in pure and perfect form the dynamics of romantic philosophy: the explosive interaction of limited knowledge, outward obstacles to further discovery – and boundless hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The crush reveals how willing we are to allow details to suggest a whole. We allow the arch of someone’s eyebrow to suggest a personality. We take the way a person puts more weight on their right leg as they stand listening to a colleague as an indication of a witty independence of mind. Or their way of lowering their head seems proof of a complex shyness and sensitivity. From a few cues only, you anticipate years of happiness, buoyed by profound mutual sympathy. They will fully grasp that you love your mother even though you don’t get on well with her; that you are hard-working, even though you appear to be distracted; that you are hurt rather than angry. The parts of your character that confuse and puzzle others will at last find a soothing, wise, complex soulmate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1660" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_437872c.jpg" alt="BEFORE SUNRISE FILM STILLS 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The answer to life</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In elaborating a whole personality from a few small – but hugely evocative – details, we are doing for the inner character of a person what our eyes naturally do with the sketch of a face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4352" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_1951" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t see this as a picture of someone who has no nostrils, eight strands of hair and no eyelashes. Without even noticing that we are doing it, we fill in the missing parts. Our brains are primed to take tiny visual hints and construct entire figures from them – and we do the same when it comes to character. We are – much more than we give ourselves credit for – inveterate artists of elaboration. We have evolved to be ready to make quick decisions about people (to trust or withhold, to fight or embrace, to share or deny) on the basis of very limited evidence – the way someone looks at us, how they stand, a twitch of the lips, a slight movement of the shoulder – and we bring this ingenious but fateful talent to situations of love as much to those of danger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cynical voice wants to declare that these enthusiastic imaginings at the conference or on the train, in the street or in the supermarket, are just delusional; that we simply project a false, completely imaginary idea of identity onto an innocent stranger. But this is too sweeping. We may be right. The wry posture may really belong to someone with a great line in scepticism; the head tilter may be unusually generous to the foibles of others. The error of the crush is more subtle, it lies in how easily we move from spotting a range of genuinely fine traits of character to settling on a recklessly naive romantic conclusion: that the other across the train aisle or pavement constitutes a complete answer to our inner needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1662" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/meyerowitz_ny.jpg" alt="meyerowitz_ny" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The primary error of the crush lies in overlooking a central fact about people in general, not merely this or that example, but the species as a whole: <b>that everyone has something very substantially wrong with them</b> once their characters are fully known, something so wrong as to make an eventual mockery of the unlimited rapture unleashed by the crush. We can’t yet know what the problems will be, but we can and should be certain that they are there, lurking somewhere behind the facade, waiting for time to unfurl them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How can one be so sure? Because the facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. There is too much to fear: mortality, loss, dependency, abandonment, ruin, humiliation, subjection. We are, all of us, desperately fragile, ill-equipped to meet with the challenges to our mental integrity: we lack courage, preparation, confidence, intelligence. We don’t have the right role models, we were (necessarily) imperfectly parented, we fight rather than explain, we nag rather than teach, we fret instead of analysing our worries, we have a precarious sense of security, we can’t understand either ourselves or others well enough, we don’t have an appetite for the truth and suffer a fatal weakness for flattering denials. The chances of a perfectly good human emerging from the perilous facts of life are non-existent. Our fears and our frailties play themselves out in a thousand ways, they can make us defensive or aggressive, grandiose or hesitant, clingy or avoidant – but we can be sure that they will make everyone much less than perfect and at moments, extremely hard to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t have to know someone in any way before knowing this about them. Naturally, their particular way of being flawed (very annoying) will not be visually apparent and may be concealed for quite long periods. If we only encounter another person in a fairly limited range of situations (a train journey, rather than when they are trying to get a toddler into a car seat; a conference, rather than 87 minutes into a shopping trip with their elderly father) we may, for a very long time indeed (especially if we are left alone to convert our enthusiasm into an obsession because they don’t call us back or are playing it cool), have the pleasure of believing we have landed upon an angel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1663" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/154073361.jpg" alt="Claudia Cardinale in the street" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>A mature person thinks, not, ‘There’s nothing good here’, but rather ‘The genuinely good things will – inevitably – come mixed up with really terrible things’</i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Maturity doesn’t suggest we give up on crushes. Merely that we definitively give up on the founding romantic idea upon which the Western understanding of relationships and marriage has been based for the past 250 years: that a perfect being exists who can solve all our needs and satisfy our yearnings. We need to swap the Romantic view for the Tragic Awareness of Love, which states that every human can be guaranteed to frustrate, anger, annoy, madden and disappoint us – and we will (without any malice) do the same to them. There can be no end to our sense of emptiness and incompleteness. This is a truth chiselled indelibly into the script of life. Choosing who to marry or commit ourselves to is therefore merely a case of identifying which particular variety of suffering we would most like to sacrifice ourselves for, rather than an occasion miraculously to escape from grief.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should enjoy our crushes. A crush teaches us about qualities we admire and need to have more of in our lives. The person on the train really does have an extremely beguiling air of self-deprecation in their eyes. The person glimpsed by the fresh fruit counter really does promise to be a gentle and excellent parent. But these characters will, just as importantly, also be sure to ruin our lives in key ways, as all those we love will.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A caustic view of crushes shouldn’t depress us, merely relieve the excessive imaginative pressure that our romantic culture places upon long-term relationships. The failure of one particular partner to be the ideal Other is not – we should always understand – an argument against<i> them</i>; it is by no means a sign that the relationship deserves to fail or be upgraded. We have all necessarily, without being damned, ended up with that figure of our nightmares, ‘the wrong person.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantic pessimism simply takes it for granted that one person should not be asked to be everything to another. With this truth accepted, we can look for ways to accommodate ourselves as gently and as kindly as we can to the awkward realities of life beside another fallen creature, for example, never feeling that we have to spend all of our time with them, being prepared for the disappointments of erotic life, not insisting on complete transparency, being ready to be maddened and to madden, making sure we are allowed to keep a vibrant independent social life and maintaining a clear-eyed refusal to act on sudden desires to run off with strangers on trains… A mature understanding of the madness of crushes turns out to be the best and perhaps the only solution to the tensions of long-term love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone knows that at the beginning it happens all the time…and then, as relationships get longer, it doesn’t really any more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We say it’s because we’re too busy, or tired, or just not in the mood. But why does this important ‘mood’ disappear?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rex_MODELRELEASE_1425591A1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4947" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rex_MODELRELEASE_1425591A1.jpg?resize=635%2C327" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To understand excitement, we have to go back to the early days, when we were deeply in the mood pretty much every hour. What was exciting was our ability to touch, hold, stroke – in short, possess someone who wasn’t entirely within our reach: someone who was independent and free to walk away from us – and yet miraculously was choosing not to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Expressed as an equation: SEXINESS = POSSESSION + FREEDOM</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1679" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/148275595.jpg" alt="Cupids with Venus and Mars, by Carlo Saraceni (ca 1579-1620). (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thrilling desire to be within and inside the body of another person stems from an active, mesmerised wonder that they’ve allowed us to come so close and, somewhere in the semi-conscious mind, a fruitfully worried sense they might not do so forever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, liking someone means we almost always want to reduce their ability to survive without us: in the nicest way, we relentlessly try to erode the freedom of the person we love. And so gradually, we kill the very spirit of independence that had underpinned our desire at the outset.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s something else that wears away at the sex drive: fear. Odd though it might sound, asking someone to have sex with us generally has an element of risk attached to it. The other person might say ‘no’ or even, at the limit, ‘I’d never want to do <b><i>that</i></b>.’ Sex is a request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in order to make a request, we have to feel reasonably safe about rejection. At the start, we do feel that safety because – even though we don’t know our lovers so well – we’re independent: we have our own routines, options and autonomy… If it didn’t work out, we could walk away – so we can take the risk of asking them to act stuff out, the intense compelling stuff, perhaps that one about the sailor or the other about the riding instructor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In time though, the stakes rise. Our self-sufficiency weakens. We give up our own ‘castle’ for the joint home and the ability to run away when things get bad. Out of love, we break down the pillars of our independent selves. We knit ourselves together. We no longer have very much we can squarely call our own any more. We have to make requests of the other person all the time: we want them to buy the sofa <b><i>we</i></b> like, we want very badly <b><i>not</i></b> to go and see their parents at Christmas, we rely on their income while we go back and study for a new qualification…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3359984.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4442" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3359984.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="Marital Strife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the circumstances, yet another request seems like it may really be one too many. So we don’t bring up that thing we want to do with the mask or with the long boots. We no longer have the will to lose credit or face in front of our daily negotiating partner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might just be easier to leave things alone altogether and then later to fantasise with the help of that less stressful, fraught partner: the computer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/175100987.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4443" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/175100987.jpg?resize=635%2C346" alt="Thai Tourism" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strangely, there is one thing that’s almost guaranteed to revive sex: a huge argument with a genuine possibility of separation. Major bust-ups have a curious habit of ending up in the bedroom because they bring back to light two things whose apparent absence had gravely undermined sex. Firstly: the sense that you could both theoretically walk away. And secondly, the sense that you could, though it wouldn’t necessarily be easy, survive independently.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good sex needs this, for it relies on a feeling of freedom and a buoyant self-confidence – the very things that can become oddly so scarce as the union becomes ever more co-dependent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get back to the thrill of the early days, we need to learn the deepest and best lessons of breaking up, ideally without having to go through the very sad and painful process of actually doing so.</span></p>

<p class="p1">You and your partner are waiting, and waiting, at the airport carousel for your luggage. Other people are wheeling their bags away. Soon, you are the only ones left standing by the now empty conveyor belt. Gradually, a deeply unfortunate eventuality becomes clear: your case has gone missing, along with all your clothes and some important documents too. Even if it does turn up eventually, it’s going to mean lots of calls, explanations, forms, hanging around and uncertainty. The already long day has taken an unexpected turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/310647426_90d00c5dbc_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7843" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/310647426_90d00c5dbc_b.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="310647426_90d00c5dbc_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>At this point, your partner says something about how strange it is that baggage doesn’t get lost more frequently, given the number of cases travelling around the world at any one time. The tone is observational and curious, the sort one might employ when trying out a hypothesis about the progress of the seasons. It is followed by a silence. And, suddenly, you realise deep in your heart that you are completely furious with them, furious that they could be so carefree and indifferent and ploddingly standing next to you in their casually fashionable jacket, so not-in-pain, when something like this has happened to you. Moreover, an important piece of logic falls into place: somehow, all this, the waiting around, the humiliation, the hassle, the hapless airline employees you’re going to have to deal with, this is their fault. They are to blame for everything – even the headache that is right now clasping itself like a vice around your front lobes. You turn away from them and mutter, ‘I knew all along that I should never have gone along with your selfish suggestion of this expensive, boring trip’ – which seems a sad, and rather unfair way, to precis an otherwise pleasant anniversary weekend in a foreign capital.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone might quite see, or sympathise with, the connection just made. After all your partner does not work for an airline, is not involved in baggage handling and merely brought up the idea of a weekend away, to which you gave your mutual consent. Nevertheless, we are here circling one of the most superficially irrational, but common and important of all presumptions of love: that the person to whom one has pledged oneself is not just the centre of one’s emotional existence, they are also, as a result, in a very strange, objectively insane and profoundly unjust sense, responsible for simply everything that happens to you, for good and ill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world upsets, disappoints, frustrates and hurts us in countless ways at every turn. It rejects our creative endeavours, it overlooks us in promotions, it rewards idiots, it neglects our talents, it delays our trains, loses our keys and sends our luggage off to far-flung destinations. And almost all of the time, we cannot complain. It’s too difficult to tease out who is really to blame; or even if one knows, one cannot say, for one would lose one’s job or be declared an upstart or impossibly thin-skinned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2261156584_db9eab8433_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7845" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2261156584_db9eab8433_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C356" alt="2261156584_db9eab8433_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only person to whom we can expose the multiple grievances we accumulate is the person who is closest to us; the one we love. This blessed person become the recipient of all of our accumulated rage at the injustice and imperfections of our lives. It is of course the height of absurdity to blame them. But this is to misunderstand the rules under which love operates. We simply cannot and therefore don’t usually get angry with the people who are really to blame for hurting us. Rather, we get angry with those whom we can be sure will tolerate us for blaming them. So we get angry with the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in our vicinity, the ones actually least likely to have harmed us, but most likely to stick around while we blame them for having done so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The words we mutter to our lovers undoubtedly sound mean. But let’s at least remember that we would say them to no one else on earth. They are a curious proof of intimacy, a symptom of love itself – and in their own way, oddly romantic (a detail indirectly acknowledged by their frequently sexual conclusions). What relief it may be to end up in the company of someone with whom none of the rules of propriety apply, with whom one can reveal one’s most deranged sides, whom one can accuse of a myriad of offences and yet by whom one could be sure that, once the storm has abated, one will be forgiven. We can tell any stranger something reasonable and polite, but only in the presence of someone we really trust can we dare to be properly irrational and truly unkind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In part, we get furious with our partners because we assign them such a deep role in our lives. We have faith that a person who understands obscure parts of us, whose presence solves so many of our woes, couldn’t realistically also be someone who would be unable to find a suitcase or in a wider sense fix our lives. Claims to this effect are confusedly interpreted as signs of a sadistic lack of affection and care – and have to be punished accordingly (we want to make them as unhappy as it seems they have made us). We exaggerate our partners’ powers, an exaggeration that is an echo – heard in adult life down the decades – of a child’s awe at their parents. When we blame our partners, we are remembering what it felt like when we loved a parent who could effortlessly swing us up to the ceiling, who knew everything, who could find rabbit when it got lost, who always held the tickets and the passports, who ensured there was invariably food in the fridge, who controlled the world… The partner, when loved, inherits a little of that beautiful, romantic, dangerous, unfair, trust we as children once had in our parents. At one level, the lover has learnt how to reassure the anxious child in us – that’s why we love them. But that source of strength also brings with it some very serious problems, for the primitive part of us insists on trusting them a little too much, believing that they actually control far more of existence than they possibly could.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boredcouples.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4387" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boredcouples.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="SPAIN. Majorca. 1993." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other side of the fence, when faced with the outbursts of our lovers, we should strive (it is never easy) to remember that these attacks are deeply horrible symptoms of something really very nice: that we properly matter to another person, and that they have become deeply dependent upon us for their capacity to endure the humiliations the world daily accords them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we think of love as perfect agreement, we will feel that conflict must mean that a relationship is winding down or starting to fall apart. But blame is at heart just a symptom of an intensity of investment in another person. We attack because we have richly entangled our deepest dreams and anxieties with another person. It is because we are so very close to them, that they draw us into very private zones of turbulence and distress – from which absolutely everyone else is excluded. That is one of the stranger, more unfortunate and yet (from a very calm angle) almost flattering gifts of love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many nice things we want, but are somehow a little scared of getting, because they are bound up with risks and subtle inner complications we don’t quite have a handle on: we may – at some deep level – be scared of succeeding at our career, of making money, of going out to parties, of having sex, of doing less of the cooking and cleaning, of not spending so much time with an ailing relative, of living for ourselves…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The burden of these fears is heavy, and while we are on our own, away from parents, we generally have to bear the force of our ambivalence by ourselves. But once we enter a long-term relationship, a pleasing possibility comes into view: we may be able to reallocate blame to those who have pledged themselves to us. We may (if we’re lucky enough) be able to accuse them of preventing us from getting all sorts of things we think we want deeply but are, in our hearts, somewhat conflicted about laying claim to. We end up frustrated, and yet able to throw a highly useful line at our loved one: ‘If it wasn’t for you…’</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine a couple who haven’t had sex for a while. When there’s a chance (a free evening, some wine, a relaxed mood), things start off well. But then two things can be counted upon to interrupt the process. As he begins to caress his partner, she will seem ever so slightly distracted and disengaged. She might wonder whether she locked the back door or ask if he called his mother back. ‘I’m sorry,’ she’ll add, noticing his annoyance. But the annoyance isn’t just minor (both have been here before). He grows furious, accuses her of ‘never being in the mood’ and storms out to the spare room. She asks him to return, but he refuses to re-emerge, saying it’s too late now. The couple spend the night apart. Both parties, sulking alone, are left to think of themselves as harbouring uncomplicated desires for sex. It’s just the other person who created difficulties. Both have the relief of thinking: ‘If it wasn’t for you…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of our wishes are bound up with resistances and fears. We defend ourselves against so much that we want, for there are dangers around success, intimacy, triumph, freedom… Both members of the couple might want, and yet at the same time, really quite strongly not want to sleep together (they picked each other out carefully for precisely this reason). They may have worries about potency, surrender and acceptance. Both parties have therefore skilfully elaborated behaviour (distraction; fury) that will resolutely ensure that sex is unlikely – and yet they’re able to attribute the blame firmly to the other. ‘I was only asking about the back door,’ the woman can sincerely reflect. ‘It’s normal to be furious if someone is never in the mood,’ the man will muse, from the spare room.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src-thumbnail="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-medium="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-large="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-full="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" alt="VARIOUS" title="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1059" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take a very promising student who becomes pregnant just at the end of her degree, totally by accident. She and her boyfriend were planning to get married anyway, but this inadvertent pregnancy puts immediate pay to her career ambitions (there had been talk of medical or law school). The woman goes on to have three more children by the time she is thirty. They are sent to demanding schools, and every afternoon and weekend, there are activities and playdates. The woman never has a single moment to return to thoughts of her own career – everyone can see that. At cross moments, she will accuse her husband and children of placing their needs ways before hers and of preventing her from reaching her potential. ‘If only it wasn’t for you…’ – she would have a great career by now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t that she doesn’t want a career at all, but that alongside her sincere ambitions, lie terrors of choosing the wrong thing or being humiliated through failure (her parents didn’t tolerate setbacks well; her older sister is an over-achiever).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By their very structures, relationships allow for an uncommon amount of blame fudging: whereby one person can accuse another of having blocked them from doing something they were only ever partially sure or convinced they had it in them to want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src-thumbnail="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-medium="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-large="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-full="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" alt="Hedy Lamarr pointing her finger towards Robert Young sitting next to her" title="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1061" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To purge ourselves of these patterns, in the silence of our souls, we should face up to our games. Firstly, we should make an audit: ‘What are the things I routinely blame my partner for frustrating me from doing/getting?’ The list might read: finding a better job, seeing my university friends, time to practice the guitar, playing with the children, buying a new car, doing more of the cooking, having more sex… Then one must ask: ‘Could it, strangely but truly, be in some ways a relief for me to be frustrated in some of these areas? Do I have reasons to be scared of, or resistant to, some of the things I repeatedly and eloquently tell the world I so badly want? Am I deliberately creating situations for myself where I will be frustrated, to avoid the difficulties of my wants…?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless one is a paragon of mental health, the correct answer will be yes – perhaps creating an occasion for a little contrition before the long-suffering partner (who has, of course, been using us in the very same way over their own set of terrifying desires).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Under such a title, one expects something properly heroic: inter-planetary travel. Perhaps the flotation of a public company. A breakthrough in renal cancer research.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But no, the hardest job you are ever likely to face, the success of which will determine more of your satisfaction from day-to-day than any other, is that of running and sharing a household with another human being you profess to love. Domestic life, properly understood, is the neglected locus of some of the most profound and noble challenges open to any of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1127" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Wall-View-from-an-Apartment.jpg" alt="Wall-View-from-an-Apartment" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of love couldn’t disagree more. It sees finding the right person as the central hurdle of relationships. It is fascinated by, and deeply sympathetic to, the troubles and confusions surrounding the search for a life partner. Getting together with the right partner is the elusive key to a happy shared life, a goal for which one should be ready to sacrifice everything.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is deeply disturbing then, from the Romantic point of view, to find that a loving couple (people who are truly ‘right’ for one another, who overcame conflict and prejudice to be together) are liable to wind up spending a great deal of their lives – after they have finally found one another – bickering: over the TV remote control, the state of the kitchen work surfaces, each others’ parking technique and who is meant to sweep the floor and when. Standard love stories rarely take us into these challenges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sink.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4487" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sink.jpg?resize=635%2C395" alt="Do Not Disturb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The big movements of modern times – Capitalism and Feminism – also agree on dismissing the domestic. They both suggest that machines have solved the problems of the home. The dishwasher, the washing machine and the vacuum cleaner have together, at a stroke, apparently overcome the hurdles of domestic strife, allowing the focus to shift to the true battle and interest of existence: the world of paid work. The labour that is done inside the home cannot ever be valuable or serious: which is (they say) why it is unpaid and something women and men should resist being overly identified with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, we don’t ever really accept that household management and division are going to be hard and important. We have no problem grasping that it might be tricky to locate exoplanets, drive a Formula One car, perform surgery on the hypothalamus or increase the earnings per share of a listed company. That’s why disputes around how to do these things feel entirely appropriate. People write position papers, give conference speeches, make submissions to learned academies and produce elaborately argued case studies. They spend many years deliberately acquiring the relevant skills that will eventually enable them to have a decent shot at dealing with such demanding undertakings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1128" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/launderette.jpg" alt="Couple meet at &quot;washateria.&quot;" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s startlingly different when we look at domestic activities – doing the laundry, keeping the fridge stocked, cleaning up after meals, making the beds, dusting bookshelves, arranging a rota for the children, deciding what friends to see and when – these are things that we think should just happen in the background of real life. They never demand much thought. They are inherently demeaning. They are mere chores. No one could be meant to do them. It is simply a matter of everyone taking a fair turn at a boring, banal but sadly unavoidable drudgery.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you expect something to be easy and it turns out not to be, there’s a particular kind of struggle and bad mood that follows. Arguing about who should take out the rubbish, or whether to keep the bedroom window slightly open at night take on a distinctively painful form. Not only are we seriously angry, we can’t take our anger seriously. We fall into that pattern of behaviour typical when a problem hasn’t faced up to its own complexity. One person starts to nag, nagging defined as the repeated unsympathetic hasty attempt to force someone to do something they’re resisting. Nagging doesn’t try to understand or elegantly persuade (as one might if one knew something was hard). It doesn’t start with the assumption that there is a legitimate disagreement over a serious topic that needs head-on discussion – only that the other person is not pulling their weight over something petty and obvious and needs just prodding and poking. Nagging then typically generates its counterpart: passive avoidance or shirking. The shirker doesn’t argue back, doesn’t explain where they are coming from, doesn’t try to think through what is really the matter. They simply try to escape, shut their ears and hope the problem (so boring to both parties) will just go away.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mess3.jpg" alt="VARIOUS - 1997" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After too much nagging and shirking, one person or another generally decides to act unilaterally. We just give up trying to talk and, without sympathy for any view other than our own, simply snarl and grab the remote, or get up suddenly and slam the window shut, or go outside and start the car – all symptoms of deeply serious issues that have fatally insisted on their own simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="p1">The dominant Romantic approach to relationships will lead us to panic at how difficult domestic life turns out to be. Romanticism feeds a tendency to see practical conflicts as a sign that you and your partner are not right for one another. If you were, you simply wouldn’t be having such immense conflicts over ‘tiny things’: like when it is necessary to use a breadboard,  or whether to leave a light on in the hall at night.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hose.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By contrast, through greater realism, the Classical view is more hopeful. It sees the challenges of sharing a space (with all the financial and practical responsibilities that come with it) as being at least as important as finding the right person in the first place. It reassures us that it’s not a sign that someone is wrong for you if you are getting deeply irate about toothpaste speckles on the mirror or if you have seen many an evening ruined by squabbling over the bins. Conflict in these areas is the logical consequence of the difficult tasks we have been accorded.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we admit that sharing a space and a life is very difficult, we come to conflicts with a very different attitude. Yes, we will argue about who puts out the bins, who gets more duvet, what we watch on TV… but the nature of the struggle will change. We won’t necessarily immediately get so impatient and so rude, we won’t nag and we won’t shirk. We’ll have the courage of our dissatisfaction – and patiently sit with a partner for a two-hour discussion (perhaps with Powerpoint) on the sink, better than ten-minute struggles over the next forty years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kitchen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4488" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kitchen.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="Man and woman working in the kitchen, c 1950." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are, each of us, forgivably weird around our domestic habits in ways we have to understand and learn to communicate properly. To one person it may seem that closing the bedroom window at night is just obviously a truly terrible thing. Maybe it was something withering their father said about their spoiled, cosseted cousins who were always complaining about draughts. Maybe it is a lingering effect of their childhood reading of The Famous Five. Reasonable or not, the open window comes to feel extremely important. And the person who takes another view is not merely in error, they are the enemy. Or holding the remote might be for your partner a major move in a life-long struggle for independence. They might not let on, but when you try to take it back you are not only attempting to get hold of a device for selecting channels and altering the volume – you are attempting to reduce them (so they feel) to a condition of infantile helplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should never assume that sitting on a sofa watching television or finding the right temperature in bed will be simple. We should stop the obsessive Romantic focus on ‘emotional’ issues. A good relationship means – almost above all else – a successful relationship around space and administration. When a relationship gets going, we therefore need not only to speak of our emotions and our childhoods, we need extended seminars between couples around dishwashers and laundry baskets, bed-times and ventilation methods. More relationships have foundered over the management of the toilet than over the dynamics of the heart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of this is a sign of failure. It is, on the contrary respectful of the complexity of one of the hardest jobs you will ever take on. We should never fall into the trap of thinking that it must be easy: Romanticism here just condemns us to a lifetime of nagging and stonewalling.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is one of the seven virtues of Christianity. It used to have a central place in Roman ethics and Judaism as well. Today, we remain deeply impressed by the idea of charity, but often from a distance, without probing the concept too deeply, with little attempt to practise it systematically. It’s something we might have recourse to when we’re moved by a documentary on the TV or have some loose change left over after the holidays.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1074" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/timetogive.jpg" alt="Retailers Hope For A Good Christmas Despite The Current Economic Gloom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its most basic, charity means: giving someone something they need but can’t get for themselves. And normally that’s understood to mean something material. We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The heroes of Christianity are exemplars of such charity. Outside the city, Saint Francis comes across a poor man. His garments are thin and ragged. Winter is coming on and coats are expensive. The saint is moved to charity.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4122" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="poorknight1700-616x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about recognising that a person needs help with something that they can’t do for themselves – and that their helplessness is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is part of the human condition. We freely give because we appreciate how often we wouldn’t have made it if other people had not – at key points, in different contexts – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in relationships that charity becomes particularly necessary. Here we don’t generally require the charity of money, cloaks and free meals. What we are short of is charity of interpretation: that is, a charitable perspective on our weaknesses, eccentricities, anxieties and follies – failings that we are unable to explain or win sympathy for, that we merely act out, with immaturity and hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1076" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sweat.jpg" alt="Poor Dad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be that one person in a couple has badly messed up in their professional life. They made a significant decision at work that played out badly. They got severely criticised; there was talk of court action. For months, they were very agitated, and hard to live with. They couldn’t articulate their fears. They were sullen and irascible. Their partner might have added stern admonitions to those of the regulator, the senior management and people on Twitter… They could have concluded that their partner was inept, greedy, maybe a bit unprincipled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead, a charitable soul does the work the partner has not been able to do. They do the explaining for them. They understand enough about their past to have a picture of where their impatience and over-ambition came from. They hold in mind what happened with their parents and with the move to another country and with the brother who died too young. They lend a picture of who the ‘beggar’ is that is sufficiently generous and complex as to make them more than just the ‘fool’ or ‘weirdo’  they could so easily have been dismissed as.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4124" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg?resize=635%2C355" alt="Romantic Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The genuinely charitable person gives generously from a sense that they too stand in need of charity. Not right now, not over this, but in some other area. They know that self-righteousness is merely the result of a faulty memory, an inability to hold in mind – at moments when one is totally right – how often one has been deeply and definitively in the wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charity remembers how there might still be goodness amidst a lot of evil. Charity keeps in mind that if someone is tired and stressed, they are liable to behave appallingly. Charity is aware that when someone shouts an insult they are not usually revealing the secret truth about their feelings. They are trying to wound the other because they feel they have been hurt – usually by someone else, whom they don’t have the authority to injure back.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Charity is interested in mitigating circumstances; in bits of the truth that can cast a less catastrophic light on our follies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but usually they stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in life as a whole, and especially in relationships, charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided: who is weak and who is powerful changes rapidly and frequently. You are likely to be, as it were, a patron in one area and a beggar in another. So we must be kind not only because we are touched by the suffering of others but because we properly understand that we too will soon be in urgent need of an equally vital dose of charity in some other part of life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The things that get us (and others) sexually excited can often sound rather improbable and mysterious. On the face of it, Wellington boots, a heavy knit fisherman’s jumper or a car park seem unconnected to sane erotic satisfaction. And yet we know perfectly well that things like these can feel essential to sex.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1603" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/car.jpg" alt="Modified Volkswagen Golf MK.5 GTi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">The surface improbability of the elements that incite lust is not merely a fascinating feature of the human condition. It is a cause of intimate trouble. How can we possibly explain to those we love the many odd-sounding things we want? Why do we even want them? We can be intensely disturbed by the direction of our own thrills. In normal life, we may be deeply opposed to cruelty and violence, and then in fantasy, we find (to our horror) that we are powerfully excited by the idea of being set upon by a rough, gun-toting intruder.</p>
<p class="p2">Sigmund Freud was one of the first people to take seriously our confusion and worries around sex. It’s good that he wanted to help us take sex seriously and was so honest about its stranger sides. But he did this at very high cost. His analyses of why we get excited were deeply contrary to any conscious reasons we might arrive at, often involving explanations pulled from deepest childhood, and made us sound so odd to ourselves that he unwittingly created incentives for further repression. Sex ended up, in Freud’s hands, seeming even more dangerous and strange than before, and hence even harder to talk about in a sane-sounding way to a lover across a bistro table.</p>
<p class="p2">There is no need for further mystery or shame. The suggestion here is that sexual excitement is in fact fairly easy to understand and not at all contrary to reason. It is continuous with many of the things we want in other areas. Though our erotic enthusiasms might sometimes sound odd (or even off-putting), they are in fact motivated by a search for the good, a search for a life marked by understanding, sympathy, trust, unity, generosity and kindness. The things that turn us on are, at heart, almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we’d like things to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s analyse a few common turn-ons in this light:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">GLASSES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> Glasses are symbols of thoughtfulness and seriousness. They’re worn by people who seem to have a lot on their plate and perhaps a lot of significant thoughts in their minds. The worry is whether these sort of people have any time for us. They may be too important to pay us and our desires much attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1605" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/glasses2.jpg" alt="&quot;Smashed&quot; Portraits - 2012 Sundance Film Festival" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> Yet many sections of erotic websites feature people in glasses. Why? Because when glasses are invited into sex, a natural – and important – anxiety is being addressed and (temporarily) resolved: the worry that thoughtfulness and seriousness on the one hand, and bodily excitement on the other might be incompatible. The imagined solution is that the person in glasses can turn out to be not only thoughtful but also extremely interested in sex and the body. Sex with glasses symbolises that the life of the mind is not separate from that of sensual pleasure, that sensitivity and seriousness can be properly reconciled with, and profoundly sympathetic to intimacy.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">UNIFORMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We often fear that authority will be hostile to us, that it will not understand or sympathise with our needs. It will simply make our lives irksome and dull. All the things we want to do will be forbidden and we will be required to be tame, uninteresting versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3228" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BA-pilots.jpg" alt="BA pilots and sisters Cliodhna and Aoife Duggan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> A sexual fantasy involving people in uniforms is an imagined solution to fears around authority. All kinds of uniform are capable of sparking excitement: most often business suits but also the outfits of doctors, nurses and pilots… These are the professions that scare and intimidate us, but in our sexual games, we invite the uniform in to reduce their power over us. The uniform still stands for authority but now authority has moved to our side, paying us exactly the right kind of attention. The pilot, far from being impassively at the controls, is thrilled to be here with us, she is no longer our enemy but our collaborator.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal which we are seeing, played out in an erotic context, is that authority might help rather than hinder us, reassure rather than intimidate us. We are, as it were, imagining a utopia in which strength, organisation, neatness and order are there to make us feel more at ease, more relaxed and truer to ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SLAVERY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We are taught from a young age that we must become independent. We live in an individualistic culture that constantly vilifies dependence and pushes us towards an ideal of solitary maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1607" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rope.jpg" alt="Venus Erotic Fair 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> And yet it seems, in our sexual selves, many of us are deeply turned on by the idea of thorough passivity and submission, as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won’t have our best interests at heart. They won’t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the deep hope in the erotic scenario is that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a common feature of all sexual fantasies that they do not – of course – genuinely solve the problems from which they draw their excitement. But we shouldn’t worry if the fantasy fails to solve the problem in reality. What we’re looking for here is simply a way of explaining and sympathising with the desire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DOMINATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> Modern life demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. Of course, in private, we go through life often thinking that we know what’s good for another person or feeling that someone deserves some rather harsh treatment.  In our hearts, we might like to be very bossy, very demanding and insistent. We would like to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But of course, in the real world, this is made difficult by the  fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status which would allow us to exercise power as we would want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1608" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/snm.jpg" alt="Dungeon Dwellers And Domination Enthusiasts Descend On DomconLA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> The fantasy is that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint, no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person. And now in the sexual game, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety – because one might be mistaken about another’s wishes, because there might be resentment, because one might hurt someone – the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">VIOLENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> In childhood, we were able to jump around and hit one another a bit and that was fine, even great fun. But now in adulthood, we are infinitely more circumspect. All violence is prohibited. We are terrified of force, against us or by us.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1609" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boysplaying.jpg" alt="Two boys wrestling" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> But in daydreams: it can be nice to take a swipe, to have someone hit you; they could get rough; and you could get forceful. It would be violent, there’d be a savage edge. And yet, magically, no one would really be harmed. No one would be left bereft. The other person would accept one’s violent, extreme possibilities. They wouldn’t be shocked. One wouldn’t have to be so careful; afterwards there would be love and cosiness, till next time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the fantasy that violence is no longer bad for us and others; that our anger and aggression can be expended safely, will not make others unhappy, but in fact will be welcomed by them – and that the fury of another will not wreck our lives but, in fact, bring us a kindly thrill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OUTDOOR/PUBLIC SEX</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We easily become shy about the public realm; we sense that we have to be guarded, on our best behaviour: out there in the elevators, public plazas, shopping centres, garage forecourts of the world. Even nature is seen as quite hostile – a cold, dangerous place where enemies may set upon us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/elevator1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4445" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/elevator1.jpg?resize=634%2C536" alt="Spaniard David Molina (R) comes across I" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> So the longing arises that we could be as much at ease in the outdoors, in public and in nature, as we can be at home. It would be a solution to a kind of oppression to have sex in the elevator, in the library stacks, out behind the petrol station, in the park… Sex outdoors is pleasurable for the same reasons as picnics are: they are ways of taming the world by taking the domestic out into it. Any activity which has become linked to indoors can be blissful when done outside because it symbolises a conquest of our anxieties – it is a way of imagining being more at home in the world than we normally can be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One can analyse almost any so-called fetish (shyness, cardigans, flat shoes, boots, cigars, stockings, striped socks etc.) and find similar structures: an anxiety and a corresponding longing, to which an erotic charge has become connected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looked at like this, sexual scenarios can be explained to ourselves – and, crucially to other people in our lives – in fairly rational, sensible terms. We can take people into our history: we can explain how our fear that sensitivity and seriousness had to be disdainful of the body was formed. We can tell them how, when we were adolescents, there were some instances that really seemed to make this idea problematic, how we got searching for a solution to it, and how glasses got involved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By talking like this, we can hope that sexual tastes will become less a little shameful and a little less threatening – and our erotic solutions a bit more reasonable and, in their own way, a lot more logical.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the things that makes us fall in love with people is realising they can do something we can’t. We get attracted to people who seem capable and at ease with parts of life in which we struggle. Perhaps they are very administratively capable, and we are inept; or they are creative, and we are more procedural. They might be highly sensitive, whereas we find our own feelings hard to deal with.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hope, if only at an unconscious level, is that by getting together with this person, we will learn and develop. Their virtues will change us. We’ll grow more confident or wittier, better at paperwork or readier to analyse our inner lives. Love offers us a vision of growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7478764714_d09ab413bc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8858" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7478764714_d09ab413bc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="7478764714_d09ab413bc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But something nasty tends to happen to this promise of development along the years. A person’s so-called strengths have an unfortunate habit of turning, in the beholder’s eyes, into something excessive and dispiriting. Charming ‘self-restraint’ can edge into simple ‘coldness’. ‘Creativity’ can come to resemble ‘mania’. ‘Traditional values’ may appear like ‘narrow-minded provincialism.’ ‘Administrative competence’ starts, over a decade, to seem like ‘obsessive compulsive ordering.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple can fall victim to the phenomenon of polarisation, whereby the pro in a given area gets ever stronger and more resentful of the other’s weakness, and the amateur gets ever weaker and more humiliated by, and dismissive of, the other’s strength. The partner who is a pro loses any interest in teaching the other how to acquire their quality and, instead, merely gets irritated with their relative incompetence. Meanwhile, the amateur takes early retirement from the virtue in question, practises it less and looks at the pro with increasing suspicion and disdain.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Take the familiar problem of administrative competence. Imagine a couple where one person is stronger, the other weaker in this area. In the early days, one party much admired the other for being able to handle this side of things well. Yet over time, the tasks have somehow all gravitated in the direction of the competent one – generating conflict and resentment. The administrative pro believes they have to be on top of everything because the other seems ever more hopeless. At times they feel cursed that they have (by some fateful error) joined their life to a bureaucratic shirker. Whereas the amateur one (who had once felt this competence to be attractive) feels, with great disappointment, that their partner is becoming horribly rigid and authoritarian.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8862" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<h6 class="p2"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or it could be that a couple has split painfully into ‘the creative one’ and ‘the practical one’. To the creative one, their partner is always finding the downside of any plan; they never speculate or daydream, they can’t take anything seriously if it doesn’t involve profit projections. Meanwhile the supposedly more practical comes to feel that their partner is often deluded, volatile and untrustworthy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under pressure, these polarised positions become explosive: the instinctive response is to feel that one has somehow ended up with the wrong partner. Yet the truth is, we have this conflict precisely because we are with the right kind of person. It’s just we’re handling the differences in the wrong way. We’ve forgotten to teach one another the virtues we were, at the outset, attracted by – and admired for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task of reducing the tension – and of lessening the damage each person is doing to the other – lies with the pro. They are in the position of strength (one is always the relative pro in some areas and the relative amateur in others). The pro needs to recognise that their hypercompetence in a given area, far from helping the situation, is in fact centrally responsible for creating it. It is unwittingly fostering and reinforcing the incompetence of the other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The issue comes down to how best to teach. The pro implicitly believes that the best kind of teaching involves berating the student for their incompetence (for being ‘anal’ or ‘cold’ or ‘mad’ or ‘a social climber’ or a ‘mouse’). But of course, this only creates fear and withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are teaching a child to do a maths problem, they won’t improve if one rushes in and gives the answer. And the more irate you become, the more confused and desperate they will feel. We know this in maths, and adopt different strategies. A key one is:<em> we pretend we don’t know. We hold back from showing our abilities</em>. We play at being a bit weaker than we are, to aid them to get stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4893867199_906a1984ef.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8860" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4893867199_906a1984ef.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="4893867199_906a1984ef" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we tend not to adopt such a benign – and constructive – attitude in romantic life. We don’t see the partner as a ‘beginner’ in a legitimate subject area (like, perhaps, being punctual or cuddling), who needs carefully calibrated assistance. That’s because we are not in the habit of recognising that it really is an ability to process anxieties about an appointment to a degree where they don’t make us late, or to reduce our fears around intimacy enough to give someone a hug.</span></p>
<p class="p2">To change the dynamics of polarisation, the pro needs to back off from what comes a little too easily to them. They should see that their hypercompetence is actually discouraging the weaker party. They should – on purpose, for a time – get a bit worse in an area than they are: they should, out of kindness, play at becoming a bit shyer, messier, less creative… and thereby gently encourage the other person to take up the slack to restore the overall balance of a virtue within the relationship. They might have to tolerate things going a little wrong for a while in certain areas: the finances might get a bit muddled. They might miss a couple of parties. Dust could accumulate under the bed…</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2577593710_063558fe47_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8859" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2577593710_063558fe47_o.jpg?resize=635%2C563" alt="2577593710_063558fe47_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pro needs to understand that their own ability and ease in an area cannot be ordered. It has to be taught in the gentlest way. But they can feel reassured that the other party does deep down want to learn: that’s what the initial attraction was based on. One was attracted by difference and hoped to grow more complete. It’s just that no one ever learns when feeling humiliated.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We are – each one of us – probably more one than the other. The categories explain a lot about us; how we approach nature, what makes us laugh, our attitudes to love, what our politics are… We may not be used to conceiving ourselves in these terms, but the labels Romantic and Classical usefully bring into focus some of the central themes of our personalities and help us to gain a clearer hold on the underlying structure of our enthusiasms and concerns.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What follows are a few of the central contrasting characteristics of Romantic and Classical personalities:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. Intuition vs. Analysis</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics relish things that seem slightly to defy rational explanations. They are enthusiastic about feelings and wary of the intellect as a guide to life. They believe one shouldn’t always think too much. In their eyes, it may be slightly unfair to probe a decision or a mood too hard; they like instinct.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2314" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/176451971.jpg" alt="MYANMAR-ASTRONOMY-METEOR-SHOWER-PERSEIDS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In particular, they think one shouldn’t always attempt to take apart emotions as they relate to love, to the more spiritual varieties of experiences and to art and literature. They have (in appropriate contexts) a deep respect for unclear language and obscure modes of expression, which seem to them to hint at valuable yet ineffable aspects of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Classicists, on the other hand, are wary of intuition. They tend to have learnt, often through bitter experience, how misguided and deluded their own feelings may be and hence look rather sceptically and caustically upon them. They see no conflict between loving art and taking it apart and asking what it should be for. They favour clear modes of expression (even about rare and evanescent emotions, like those one might have looking at the stars) and like language that an intelligent 12-year-old could understand.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2315" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase64aa8cbe482f11ad6d.png" alt="pngbase64aa8cbe482f11ad6d" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2.  Spontaneity vs. Education</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics have often been wary of teaching and instruction. They think that important and serious activities should be spontaneous rather than taught. The idea that people might need to think rationally and exhaustively about what career to choose for themselves or whom they should marry strikes the Romantic as a misguided intrusion of education into things which should be spontaneous and natural (they like the notion of a ‘calling’ and of ‘love at first sight’).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2316" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/57210933.jpg" alt="Pillow fight" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of Romantics’ respect for spontaneity leads them to look with particular interest at children, who seem to them to have more direct access to the kind of truths and sensibilities that adults have lost. To the Romantic, it will always be a child who points out that the emperor is wearing no clothes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Those of a Classical temperament don’t necessarily respect the current education system as we know it, but the abstract idea of education seems to them very important. They believe that training is vital if we are to avoid making too many mistakes in our emotional or professional lives. The Classically minded person sees education as perfectly placed to make good the shortfalls of our wayward natures.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2317" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/102580313.jpg" alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY SOFIA MISELEM A" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. Honesty vs. Politeness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic person is devoted to saying what they think or feel. They are allergic to the idea of being fake or of having secrets. Authenticity is vital. They imagine politeness as a very dull lid that suppresses what really matters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us. They believe deeply in getting on around other people. It is not that they are afraid of ruffling anyone’s feathers per se – but they just doubt whether it is ever really a constructive move and they are not interested in merely symbolic victories. They would prefer to have civil relations with someone rather than tell them frankly what is on their mind. They’re alive to how difficult it is for us to take on board challenging information from someone else. They accept an important role for secrets and white lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. Idealism vs. Realism</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be, and judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative. Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment and anger as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises, and timidity of the powerful. They are often furious with governments and surprised and outraged by evidence of venal and self-interested conduct in society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2320" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/129451067.jpg" alt="Demonstrators Continue To Occupy London's Financial District In A Protest Against City Greed" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For their part, the Classical person pays special attention to what can go wrong. They are very concerned to mitigate the downside. They are aware that most things could be a lot worse. Before condemning a government, they consider the standard of governments across history and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances… Their view of people is fundamentally rather dark. They believe that everyone is probably slightly worse than they seem. They feel humans have deeply dangerous impulses, lusts and drives, and take it for granted when bad behaviour manifests itself. They simply feel this is what humans are prone to. High ideals make them nervous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Earnestness vs. Irony</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Romantics don’t believe in how things are. Their attention is fixed on how they should be. They therefore resist the deflationary call of ironic humour, which seems defeatist. They are earnest in their search for a better future.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical conviction is not that the world is a cheerful place, far from it; but rather that a cheerful mood is good starting point for living in a radically imperfect and deeply unsatisfactory realm – where the priority is not to give up, despair and kill oneself. Ironic humour is a standard recourse for them, because it emerges from the constant collision between how one would want things to be – and how it seems they in fact are. They like a bit of gallows humour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2322" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1388438j.jpg" alt="Curb Your Enthusiasm - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. The Rare vs. The Everyday</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic rebels against the ordinary. They are keen on the exotic and the rare. They like things which the mass of the population won’t yet know about. The fact that something is popular will always be a mark against it. Nor do they much like routine, especially in domestic life. They are anxious about higher things being put under pressure to become ‘useful’ or commercial. They want heroism, excitement and an end to boredom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4293" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog.jpg?resize=635%2C547" alt="Caspar_David_Friedrich_032_The_wanderer_above_the_sea_of_fog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical personality welcomes routine as a defence against chaos. They would very much like good things to be popular. They don’t necessarily think that what is popular is good; though they see popularity as, in principle, a mark of virtue. They are familiar enough with extremes as to welcome things that are a little boring. They can see the charm of doing the laundry.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4355" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet.jpg?resize=635%2C471" alt="1024px-Pieter_de_Hooch_-_At_the_Linen_Closet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">7. Purity vs. Ambivalence</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic is drawn to either whole-hearted endorsement or total rejection. Ideally partners should love everything about each other. A political party should be admirable at every turn. A philanthropist should draw no personal benefit from acts of charity. The Romantic is dismayed by compromise. They feel the attraction of the lost cause. It is very important for the Romantic to feel they are right; winning is – by comparison – not such an urgent matter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4356" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Classical person takes the view that very few things, and no people, are either wholly good or entirely bad. They assume that there is likely to be some worth in opposing ideas and something to be learned from both sides. It is Classical to think that a decent person might in many areas hold views you find deeply unpalatable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time now, perhaps since around 1750, Romantic attitudes have been dominant in the Western imagination. The prevailing approach to children, relationships, politics and culture has all been coloured more by a Romantic spirit than by a Classical one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4358" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I.jpeg?resize=635%2C480" alt="1144px-Claude_Monet_-_Graystaks_I" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both Romantic and Classical orientations have important truths to impart. Neither is wholly right or wrong. They need to be balanced. And none of us are in any case ever simply one or the other. But because a good life requires a judicious balance of both, at this point in history, it might be the Classical attitude whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently. It is a mode of approaching life which is ripe for rediscovery – and it can be repeatedly sampled in these pages.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anyone of childbearing age will be surrounded by examples of catastrophic parenting in their own and previous generations. We hear no end of gruesome stories about breakdowns and resentments, shame and addiction, chronic failures of self-confidence and inabilities to form satisfying relationships. And at the root of all these varieties of suffering, one central cause sticks out: a lack of love. It was because the parents were remote and domineering, unreliable and frightening that life has never been quite complete.</p>
<p class="p1">From such failures, a major assumption has come to dominate modern ideals of parenting: that one must, above all else, love one’s child thoroughly, with immense sympathy, gentleness and kindness and that if one does so, the child will develop into a happy, loving and fulfilled human being.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the Romantic view of parenting and it is at its most vivid and self-assured in the early years, especially at moments when the child (finally) lies asleep in its cot, defenceless before the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/baby-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4461" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/baby-1.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="Official Pictures of Princess Estelle Silvia Ewa Mary of Sweden, Duchess of Ostergotland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, despite immense investments and profound devotion, one is – gradually – liable to be inducted into a far more complex and challenging set of truths: that love is not a universal panacea and that giving unconditional affection is no guarantee of all the results one had hoped for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The terrifying 3am truths about parenting run a little like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You are a punchbag</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The blades of your child’s remote-controlled helicopter snapped after five minutes, just as you were starting to get the hang of flying it. The fault lies squarely with the manufacturers. But, sadly, they were not present in the kitchen – so, at once and not for the first time, you became the target for the raging disappointment of your child.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-886" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/481684085.jpg" alt="Nursery" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The repeated bad behaviour is surprising of course (it wasn’t meant to be that way), but it is a perverse sort of tribute to you nevertheless. One has to feel rather safe around someone in order to be this difficult. You certainly weren’t so tricky with your parents when you were young, but then again, you never felt so loved. All those assurances – ‘I will always be on your side’ – have paid off perfectly: they have encouraged your child to direct their every frustration and disappointment onto the loving adult who has signalled that they can, and will, take it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You have to be the spoil sport</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human nature has a strong – and exceedingly inconvenient – bias towards indulging in whatever is most immediately pleasant and fun. And yet the central, unavoidable task of being a loving parent is to encourage the child to delay gratification in the interests of longer-term fulfilment. That’s why there will be fights. Constantly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After all, it is so much nicer to play Minecraft than to learn how to spell ‘scythe’ or ‘embarrassment’; so much more amusing to see what happens if you put a hosepipe in the car’s exhaust than to do maths homework; so much better to read a magazine than brush one’s teeth, so much more gratifying to stay in bed than have a shower.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90767435.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4457" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90767435.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="Two children playing while a man reads a newspaper, c 1949." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of love, a parent must – all the time, in small ways and large – say no. And for this, they will be severely punished. They will be treated as if they had arbitrarily made up the mechanics of tooth decay or had designed an economic system where the playing of computer games was disconnected from a capacity to pay bills. They will be punished for always bringing up unwelcome facts. And they will be very unfavourably compared with people who give the child whatever they want – because they just don’t care about them. It’s the thoughtless hedonistic characters, the ones who suggest all-night cartoon sessions and come around with iPads, who will be viewed as the heroes while the caring, denying parent has to contend with being called a ‘meanie’ and, later perhaps, a fascist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You have to exert authority rather than teach</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream is to coax the child into doing certain difficult things without ever having to demand they do so by force. The dream is not to have to ‘exert authority’, by which one means, bypass reason in order to impose a conclusion. The dream is to teach, and never to rely on the more basic weapons, like the assertion that one is the older, richer, bigger party.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One thinks with distaste of the Victorian parent demanding obedience simply by saying ‘I am your mother, I am your father’. To the child, the meaning of these words, mother and father, have changed entirely; they now mean merely ‘someone who will make it nice for me’ and ‘someone I will agree with if I see the point of what they’re saying.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But attempts to teach and appeal to a child’s reason can only go so far. Whatever one says in a gentle voice, the children won’t eat vegetables; they won’t want to get out of bed in the morning; they will want to mock their younger brother or sister; they won’t stop playing the computer game.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When the child is very small, it is easy enough to deal with these protests: one can just lift them up or distract them in some kindly way for a moment. But later, by six, one has to use authority: one must simply assert that one knows best without explaining one’s reasons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The child wouldn’t have the relevant bits of experience that would render one’s lessons comprehensible. A nine-year-old girl cannot understand how humiliating her six-year-old brother physically is a bad idea because this might make it hard for him to relate easily to women when he is older. It isn’t her fault she can’t understand. It would indeed be wholly unreasonable to expect a nine-year-old to be reasonable – and correctly comprehend the force and direction of adult concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dream is that one will be able to pass on insights to the child that were painfully accumulated through experience, and thereby save them time. But in the absence of experience, insight doesn’t work. One cannot rush children to conclusions; one cannot spare them time. They will need, with difficulty, to make many of the same mistakes (and a few new ones too) and waste a good part of their lives finding out what you already know full well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t make things too nice for them</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern culture is deeply vexed – and appalled – by the thought that development might require suffering. We have been traumatised by the barbaric old-fashioned enthusiasm for punishment, the view – expressed by generations of sadistic Victorian school masters – that success demands pain, that there is a necessary relationship between early discomfort and humiliation and later strength and ‘character’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/78948425-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4463" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/78948425-1.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="Volume 2, Page 74, Picture, 1. A picture of a mother telling off her son. 1958" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we have not merely rejected the Victorian mechanisms for inflicting suffering (the cold showers, the beatings), we have for the most part sought to abolish suffering altogether. Kindness has been triumphant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet this attempt to abolish suffering involves waging a counter-productive and ultimately cruel war with the facts of human nature. We know from our own experience that we have at key moments grown through things that had a painful side to them: that there were terrors, rejections and disappointments that – in the end – made us more mature and better able to pursue our goals. We know that the drive to accomplish certain things, to master some difficult material, to win out over others, gained some of its power from fear and desperate insecurity. Because someone (perhaps a parent) didn’t believe in us, we redoubled one’s efforts. Because we were afraid of the consequences of failure, because succeeding was the only way to impress someone we loved but who wasn’t easily impressed, we put on an extra spurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We desperately want our child to grow mature but without going through awful things. We hate being an agent of fear. We want always to cheer and to hug. We want everything to be nice. Yet we also know, in our hearts, that this can only be a path to ruin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t guarantee their goodness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Romantic view of existence sees all humans as fundamentally good from birth: it is only upbringing and a lack of love that corrupts and damages us and in the process, makes us cruel. Romanticism states that if only a child can grow up anxiety free, secure and encased in love, it will never break another child’s toy, rip up their paintings or try to scare them. The child will be reliably kind if she or he has reliably been shown kindness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But experience suggests the existence of some ineluctably dark sides hard-wired in us and beyond the reach of the gentlest behaviour: certain kinds of aggression, cruelty and violence appear to be a given. A child may just want to hit its sibling out of excess vitality, boredom or native sadism. It might just be fun to smack someone in the face to see what happens.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why there used to be such an emphasis on manners. Those who upheld them didn’t believe that a child ever could be spontaneously good simply because they’d been shown love. Indeed, a firm denial of love was what was necessary to help the child to create a wall between what they might feel inside and what they knew they could express with others. Being strict wasn’t a route to making anyone evil, it was a way to teach a person to keep their evil firmly locked up inside themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">You can’t guarantee their success</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The modern parent believes that it might be possible to mould a happy, fulfilled, successful human. From this flows the minute attention to detail, from the purchase of the cot to the time-tabling of after-school activities. It is this that explains the Mandarin lessons, the French horn, the educational trips to the countryside and the ruinous tutor fees – because with all this in place, fate and failure can surely be kept at bay.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reading1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4467" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/reading1.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="Book At Bedtime" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the relationship between effort and return is more bizarre and more random. We cannot spare those we love the cup of human sorrow – whatever the intensity of our after-school programmes. We are always statistically most likely to give birth to mediocrities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>You will be forgotten</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You take great care not to be frightening. You make silly jokes, put on funny voices, pretend to be a bear or a camel – all so as not to intimidate, so as to be approachable, the way one’s own parents were not. It should be a recipe for reciprocated love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But weirdly, we rather like difficult people in a way, people we can’t quite read, who aren’t around so often, who are a bit scary. They hook us in – in a way the kind, stable ones never quite do. One loses authority by being natural, approachable, friendly, a bit daft, the clown who doesn’t want to scare.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An even more dispiriting thought comes to mind. Love them reliably and without fear and you will be forgotten. Be distant, intermittent, often absent and deeply volatile, and they will be obsessed with you for life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And with these thoughts fully aired, it will be time for the kindly parent to attempt to return to sleep. It will be a long day – with the kids – tomorrow.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the ideals of modern relationships is that both parties will be ‘good communicators’. ‘Communication’ is held to lie at the heart of a thriving partnership.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what is ‘communication’? It isn’t – of course – merely talking. One wouldn’t count as a good communicator simply on the basis of being able to keep up a lively patter about the weather or serving up witty anecdotes about the local team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/writingsand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4390" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/writingsand.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Man writes 'I LOVE U' in the sand for his sweetheart, 1920-60." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good communication means the capacity to give another person an accurate picture of what is happening in your emotional and psychological life – and in particular, the capacity to describe its very darkest, trickiest and most awkward sides in such a way that others can understand, and even sympathise with them. The good communicator has the skill to take their beloved, in a timely, reassuring and gentle way, without melodrama or fury, into some of the trickiest areas of their personality and warn them of what is there (like a tour guide to a disaster zone), explaining what is problematic in such a way that the beloved will not be terrified, can come to understand, can be prepared and may perhaps forgive and accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But most of us are, of course, appalling communicators – and that is because there is so much inside of us that we can’t face up to, feel ashamed of or can’t quite understand – and we are therefore in no position to present our depths sanely to an observer, whose affections we want to maintain. Perhaps you have completely wasted the day on the internet. Or you are feeling sexually restless and drawn to someone else. Or you are in a vortex of envy for a colleague who seems to be getting everything right at work. Or you’re feeling overwhelmed by regret and self-hatred for some silly decisions you took last years (because you crave applause). Or maybe it’s a terror of the future that has rendered you mute: everything is going to go wrong. It’s over. You had one life – and you blew it. There are things inside of us that are simply so awful, and therefore so undigested, that we cannot – day to day – lay them out before our partners in a way that they can grasp them calmly and generously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hoody.jpg" alt="A young couple talk outside a hotel near" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet where we don’t ‘communicate’ a message, we still manage to get our points across, but just in toxic forms. As the expression goes, we ‘act out.’ Unable to pin down in a rational form what is ailing us, we may – for example – swear intemperately when someone asks us what is up. Or we go silent. Or we manically avoid subjects.</span></p>
<p class="p1">At the heart of the issue is the fact that we don’t only want our lovers to understand us. Certainly we want to be understood, but even more badly, we want to be loved – and when there appears to be an incompatibility, where we have no faith in our ability to get the tricky sides of us across, it is the truth that will be sacrificed – and yet will leak out in toxic symptoms nevertheless.</p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we find communication so difficult?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: No good role models</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learn to speak by hearing others speak. And in particular, we learn to speak about tricky topics because we hear others discussing them elegantly and kindly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tellingoff.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4391" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tellingoff.jpg?resize=635%2C459" alt="Naughty Boy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But most of us did not grow up around ‘good communicators’. Parental figures may have loved us, but they did not pull off the trick of describing the darkness within in timely, sane and reassuring ways. Instead, they acted out. They came home from work and shouted at us or the other parent because a colleague had humiliated them or they set the dishes down with a bang because they were feeling sexually neglected. A hugely damaging precedent was set.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Can you be ‘bad’ and yet still – overall – good?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the ideal upbringing, those who loved us would be able to do so without demanding that everything about us be good. They could also tolerate that we could – sometimes, for a while – be violent, angry, mean and sexual – and yet still remain essentially acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would give us a vital backdrop for our later confessions, an impression of fundamental acceptability. One could be, more or less, oneself and be confident that a loved one could – so long as things were explained properly – understand. We wouldn’t need to grow up into liars for love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fatherson.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4393" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fatherson.jpg?resize=635%2C485" alt="Father &amp; Son Talking, Son Is Leaning On Father." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would be particularly true around sex, which is the most ‘shameful’ event to hit the life of any adolescent. Ideally, it would be possible to encounter unnerving aspects of one’s own erotic drives (the longing to do things which in any other context would seem dreadful; the longing to be – in bed – violent, disrespectful, crude…) without feeling that the whole of one’s nature would be deemed sordid and deranged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But mostly we come from backgrounds which fall far short of this ideal. We feel that if we ever lose our tempers with our partners, we will be revealed as essentially brutish. Or if we confess to having some lazy sides, we will be condemned as layabouts. Or if we outline some slightly off-beat sexual tastes, we’ll descend into depravity and perversion. Or if we reveal our worries about work, we’ll set off a panic about our fundamental ineptitude. All this rather than feeling confident that we are basically, where it counts, essentially normal and decent people facing the typical run of chaotic and unruly desires and challenges endemic to every worthwhile human life.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Our tendency to get disgusted with ourselves – and therefore to assume that others will judge us harshly – is the central obstacle to communication. Shame robs us of the capacity to put our case sensibly and plausibly. It makes us long to conceal our failings; we feel the only way to protect ourselves and retain some quantum of dignity is to go silent. It’s not arrogance or the idea that one’s partner has no right to know. It is sheer terror that one’s self-loathing will be intensified to an unbearable degree by the presence of a witness.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: It will hurt you too much to hear this</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Neglectful parents aren’t, in this area, the sole problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s an even more dangerous possibility. The parent who loves fiercely, with enormous generosity, with depths of self-sacrifice – and whom one adores back. Except it seems they need one to be a certain way. They cannot be disappointed. They are fragile and it is one’s job to help keep them intact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If I tell you this bad but true thing, you will be deeply saddened and hurt. You won’t ever be able to take it.” A child might learn this way of thinking when confronted by a deeply loving and tender parent, who (whatever the truth) gives the impression that they could easily be hurt by witnessing part of your personality which doesn’t fit their preconceived ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piano.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4397" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piano.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Family Photo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you told them that you loathed the cello, it would wound them terribly, for they specially arranged for you to have lessons, they were so proud of you; and they saved up to buy the instrument for many years. Or if you tell them you hate going to visit your grandparents on Saturdays, it might be experienced as an agonising betrayal from which they might never fully recover. Or if they knew what you get up to late at night under the sheets…</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This alerts us to the reciprocal nature of good communication. We must strive to tell the truth about ourselves honestly and kindly. But, from the other side of the equation, we must also strive to be the sort of people who can take the truth with grace, who don’t set the bar of acceptability so high that we leave others no chance but to tell us lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: No one can understand me</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no surprise if we sometimes think that communication will never work out. We have failed so often in the past. Our history is full of failed attempts. We’ve tried to tell our partner something and it hasn’t worked. So, we give up. Forever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn-635x475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4395" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="Audrey Hepburn And Albert Finney In 'Two For The Road'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, to inject hope into the situation, this fear is governed by a false assumption: the idea that we can’t <em>learn</em> how better to communicate what is going on inside us. However, if we come to the view that it is in fact extremely challenging to communicate and that no one can be expected to do so automatically, then we may interpret past failures more generously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that it didn’t work out in the past isn’t decisive. We just need to learn to accept the darkness, to reduce fear, to present ourselves calmly, not to give way to self-loathing… We need to go to school in this area as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication in relationships sits within that huge neglected category of things that we need so badly to learn how to do, but which we have tended to assume we must know about instinctively from the start – to our and our lovers’ immense cost.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There are sweet moments – early on in relationships – when one person can’t quite work up the courage to let another know just how much they like them. They’d love to touch the other’s hand and find a place in their life; but their fear of rejection is so intense, they hesitate and falter. Our culture has a lot of sympathy for this awkward and intensely vulnerable stage of love.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/weekend2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4399" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/weekend2.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="Weekend - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">We’re taught to be patient about the way people might get a bit odd when trying to express their needs early on. They might become somewhat flustered or tongue-tied. Or they might act sarcastically or coldly, not from indifference, but as a way to disguise a disturbingly powerful enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The assumption, however, is that the terror of rejection will be limited in scope, focused on one particular phase of a relationship: its beginning. Once a partner finally accepts us and the union gets underway, the assumption is that the fear must come to an end. It would be peculiar for anxieties to continue even after two people had made some thoroughly explicit commitments to one another, after they had secured a joint mortgage, bought a house together, made vows, had a few children and named each other in their wills.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sean.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4400" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sean.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="Sean Connery And Tippi Hedren In 'Marnie'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">And yet one of the odder features of relationships is that in truth, the fear of rejection never ends. It continues, even in quite sane people, on a daily basis, and has some devastating consequences – chiefly because we refuse to pay it sufficient attention and aren’t trained to spot its counter-intuitive symptoms in others. We haven’t found a stigma-free, winning way to keep admitting just how much reassurance we need.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within our psyches, acceptance is never a given, reciprocity is never assured; there can always be new threats, real or perceived, to love’s integrity. The trigger to insecurity can be apparently miniscule. Perhaps the other has been away at work for unusual amounts of time; or they were pretty animated talking to a stranger at a party; or it’s been a while since sex took place. Perhaps they weren’t very warm to us when we walked into the kitchen. Or they’ve been rather silent for the last half an hour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/phone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4401" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/phone.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="A suspicious woman observing her husband at the phone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">Yet even after years with someone, there can be a hurdle of fear about asking for proof that we are wanted. But with a horrible, added complication: we now assume that any such anxiety couldn’t possibly exist.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This makes it very difficult to recognise our feelings, let alone communicate them to others in ways that would stand a chance of securing us the understanding and sympathy we crave. Rather than asking for reassurance endearingly and laying out our longing with charm, we might instead mask our needs beneath some brusque and plain hurtful behaviours guaranteed to frustrate our aims. Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, three major symptoms tend to show up:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: We get distant</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to get close to our partners but feel so anxious that we may be unwanted, we freeze them out instead. We say we’re busy, we pretend our thoughts are elsewhere, we imply that a need for reassurance would be the last thing on our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1144" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alice.jpg" alt="'The L Word' TV Series, Season 6 - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might even have an affair, the ultimate face-saving attempt to be distant – as a perverse attempt to assert that we don’t require the partner’s love (that we have been too reserved to ask for). Affairs can turn out to be the oddest of compliments; arduous proofs of indifference that we reserve for, and secretly address to, those we truly care about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We get controlling</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We feel they are escaping us emotionally, and respond by trying to pin them down administratively. We get unduly cross that they are a bit late, we chastise them heavily for not having done certain chores, we ask them constantly if they’ve completed a task they had agreed to undertake. All this rather than admit: ‘I’m worried I don’t matter to you…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1145" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/angry2.jpg" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can’t (we believe) force them to be generous and warm. We can’t force them to want us (even if we haven’t asked them to…). So we try to control them procedurally. The goal isn’t really to be in charge all the time, it’s just that we can’t admit to our terror about how much of ourselves we have surrendered. A tragic cycle then unfolds. We become shrill and unpleasant. To the other person, it feels like we can’t possibly love them anymore. Yet the truth is we do: we just fear rather too much that they don’t love us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Three: We get nasty</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a final recourse, we ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about shortcomings. Anything rather than ask the question which so much disturbs us: does this person love me? And yet, if this harsh, graceless behaviour could be truly understood for what it is, it would be revealed not as rejection, but as a strangely distorted – yet very real – plea for tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to all this trouble is to normalise a new, and more accurate picture of emotional functioning: to make it clear just how healthy and mature it is to be fragile and in repeated need of reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ganges.jpg" alt="A couple smiles with their foreheads touching at night on the Ganges. Rishikesh, India." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">We suffer because adult life posits too robust a picture of how we operate. It tries to teach us to be implausibly independent and invulnerable. It suggests it might not be right to want a partner to show us they still really like us after they have been away for only a few hours. Or to want them to reassure us that they haven’t gone off us – just on the basis that they haven’t paid us much attention at a party and didn’t want to leave when we did.</p>
<p class="p2">And yet it is precisely this sort of reassurance that we constantly stand in need of. We can never be through with the requirement for acceptance. This isn’t a curse limited to the weak and the inadequate. Insecurity is, in this area, a sign of well-being. It means we haven’t allowed ourselves to take other people for granted. It means we remain realistic enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly – and are invested enough to care.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. ‘I really need you; do you still want me?’ should be the most normal of enquiries. We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and punitively macho term, ‘neediness’. We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind some of our and our partner’s most frosty, managerial and brutish moments.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Anyone we could marry would, of course, be a little wrong for us. It is wise to be appropriately pessimistic here. Perfection is not on the cards. Unhappiness is a constant. Nevertheless, one encounters some couples of such primal, grinding mismatch, such deep-seated incompatibility, that one has to conclude that something else is at play beyond the normal disappointments and tensions of every long-term relationship: some people simply shouldn’t be together.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/diana2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4360" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/diana2.jpg?resize=635%2C571" alt="Prince Charles, Prince of Wales with his fiance Lady Diana S" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How do the errors happen? With appalling ease and regularity. Given that marrying the wrong person is about the single easiest and also costliest mistake any of us can make (and one which places an enormous burden on the state, employers and the next generation), it is extraordinary, and almost criminal, that the issue of marrying intelligently is not more systematically addressed at a national and personal level, as road safety or smoking are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s all the sadder because in truth, the reasons why people make the wrong choices are easy to lay out and unsurprising in their structure. They tend to fall into some of the following basic categories.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: We don’t understand ourselves</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/viv.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4361" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/viv.jpg?resize=635%2C638" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">© Agatha A. Nitecka</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When first looking out for a partner, the requirements we come up with are coloured by a beautiful non-specific sentimental vagueness: we’ll say we really want to find someone who is ‘kind’ or ‘fun to be with’, ‘attractive’ or ‘up for adventure…’</span></p>
<p class="p2">It isn’t that such desires are wrong, they are just not remotely precise enough in their understanding of what we<em> in particular</em> are going to require in order to stand a chance of being happy – or, more accurately, not consistently miserable.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us are crazy in very particular ways. We’re distinctively neurotic, unbalanced and immature, but don’t know quite the details because no one ever encourages us too hard to find them out. An urgent, primary task of any lover is therefore to get a handle on the specific ways in which they are mad. They have to get up to speed on their individual neuroses. They have to grasp where these have come from, what they make them do – and most importantly, what sort of people either provoke or assuage them. A good partnership is not so much one between two healthy people (there aren’t many of these on the planet), it’s one between two demented people who have had the skill or luck to find a non-threatening conscious accommodation between their relative insanities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The very idea that we might not be too difficult as people should set off alarm bells in any prospective partner. The question is just where the problems will lie: perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us, or we can only relax when we are working, or we’re a bit tricky around intimacy after sex, or we’ve never been so good at explaining what’s going on when we’re worried. It’s these sort of issues that – over decades – create catastrophes and that we therefore need to know about way ahead of time, in order to look out for people who are optimally designed to withstand them. A standard question on any early dinner date should be quite simply: ‘And how are you mad?’</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-692" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/woody.jpg" alt="Marital Problems" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that knowledge of our own neuroses is not at all easy to come by. It can take years and situations we have had no experience of. Prior to marriage, we’re rarely involved in dynamics that properly hold up a mirror to our disturbances. Whenever more casual relationships threaten to reveal the ‘difficult’ side of our natures, we tend to blame the partner – and call it a day. As for our friends, they predictably don’t care enough about us to have any motive to probe our real selves. They only want a nice evening out. Therefore, we end up blind to the awkward sides of our natures. On our own, when we’re furious, we don’t shout, as there’s no one there to listen – and therefore we overlook the true, worrying strength of our capacity for fury. Or we work all the time without grasping, because there’s no one calling us to come for dinner, how we manically use work to gain a sense of control over life – and how we might cause hell if anyone tried to stop us. At night, all we’re aware of is how sweet it would be to cuddle with someone, but we have no opportunity to face up to the intimacy-avoiding side of us that would start to make us cold and strange if ever it felt we were too deeply committed to someone. One of the greatest privileges of being on one’s own is the flattering illusion that one is, in truth, really quite an easy person to live with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With such a poor level of understanding of our characters, no wonder we aren’t in any position to know who we should be looking out for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We don’t understand other people</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This problem is compounded because other people are stuck at the same low level of self-knowledge as we are. However well-meaning they might be, they too are in no position to grasp, let alone inform us, of what is wrong with them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Naturally, we make a stab at trying to know them. We go and visit their families, perhaps the place they first went to school. We look at photos, we meet their friends. All this contributes to a sense we’ve done our homework. But it’s like a novice pilot assuming they can fly after sending a paper plane successfully around the room.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-693" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/60scouple.jpg" alt="COUPLES - 1964" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a wiser society, prospective partners would put each other through detailed psychological questionnaires and send themselves off to be assessed at length by teams of psychologists. By 2100, this will no longer sound like a joke. The mystery will be why it took humanity so long to get to this point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to know the intimate functioning of the psyche of the person we’re planning to marry. We need to know their attitudes to, or stance on, authority, humiliation, introspection, sexual intimacy, projection, money, children, aging, fidelity and a hundred things besides. This knowledge won’t be available via a standard chat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the absence of all this, we are led – in large part – by what they look like. There seems to be so much information to be gleaned from their eyes, nose, shape of forehead, distribution of freckles, smiles… But this is about as wise as thinking that a photograph of the outside of a power station can tell us everything we need to know about nuclear fission.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We ‘project’ a range of perfections into the beloved on the basis of only a little evidence. In elaborating a whole personality from a few small – but hugely evocative – details, we are doing for the inner character of a person what our eyes naturally do with the sketch of a face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4352" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Matisse_La-pompadour_19511.jpg?resize=635%2C588" alt="Matisse_La-pompadour_1951" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t see this as a picture of someone who has no nostrils, eight strands of hair and no eyelashes. Without even noticing that we are doing it, we fill in the missing parts. Our brains are primed to take tiny visual hints and construct entire figures from them – and we do the same when it comes to the character of our prospective spouse. We are – much more than we give ourselves credit for, and to our great cost – inveterate artists of elaboration.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The level of knowledge we need for a marriage to work is higher than our society is prepared to countenance, recognise and accommodate for – and therefore our social practices around getting married are deeply wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: We aren’t used to being happy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We believe we seek happiness in love, but it’s not quite as simple. What at times it seems we actually seek is <em>familiarity</em> – which may well complicate any plans we might have for happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We recreate in adult relationships some of the feelings we knew in childhood. It was as children that we first came to know and understand what love meant. But unfortunately, the lessons we picked up may not have been straightforward. The love we knew as children may have come entwined with other, less pleasant dynamics: being controlled, feeling humiliated, being abandoned, never communicating, in short: suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As adults, we may then reject certain healthy candidates whom we encounter, not because they are wrong, but precisely because they are too well-balanced (too mature, too understanding, too reliable), and this rightness feels unfamiliar and alien, almost oppressive. We head instead to candidates whom our unconscious is drawn to, not because they will please us, but because they will frustrate us in familiar ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We marry the wrong people because the right ones feel wrong – undeserved; because we have no experience of health, because we don’t ultimately associate being loved with feeling satisfied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Being single is so awful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One is never in a good frame of mind to choose a partner rationally when remaining single is unbearable. We have to be utterly at peace with the prospect of many years of solitude in order to have any chance of forming a good relationship. Or we’ll love no longer being single rather more than we love the partner who spared us being so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, after a certain age, society makes singlehood dangerously unpleasant. Communal life starts to wither, couples are too threatened by the independence of the single to invite them around very often, one starts to feel a freak when going to the cinema alone. Sex is hard to come by as well. For all the new gadgets and supposed freedoms of modernity, it can be very hard to get laid – and expecting to do so regularly with new people is bound to end in disappointment after 30.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-695" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bar.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far better to rearrange society so that it resembles a university or a kibbutz – with communal eating, shared facilities, constant parties and free sexual mingling… That way, anyone who did decide marriage was for them would be sure they were doing it for the positives of coupledom rather than as an escape from the negatives of singlehood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When sex was only available within marriage, people recognised that this led people to marry for the wrong reasons: to obtain something that was artificially restricted in society as a whole. People are free to make much better choices about who they marry now they’re not simply responding to a desperate desire for sex.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we retain shortages in other areas. When company is only properly available in couples, people will pair up just to spare themselves loneliness. It’s time to liberate ‘companionship’ from the shackles of coupledom, and make it as widely and as easily available as sexual liberators wanted sex to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Instinct has too much prestige</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Back in the olden days, marriage was a rational business; all to do with matching your bit of land with theirs. It was cold, ruthless and disconnected from the happiness of the protagonists. We are still traumatised by this.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/medieval1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4363" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/medieval1.jpg?resize=635%2C569" alt="Medieval miniature. Meeting of the Roman Senate. Discussion on marriage between a plebeian woman and a roman patrician. 15th century." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What replaced the marriage of reason was the marriage of instinct, the Romantic marriage. It dictated that how one felt about someone should be the only guide to marriage. If one felt ‘in love’, that was enough. No more questions asked. Feeling was triumphant. Outsiders could only applaud the feeling’s arrival, respecting it as one might the visitation of a divine spirit. Parents might be aghast, but they had to suppose that only the couple could ever know. We have for three hundred years been in collective reaction against thousands of years of very unhelpful interference based on prejudice, snobbery and lack of imagination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marilyn1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4364" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/marilyn1.jpg?resize=635%2C586" alt="T,V, and Films, 16th January 1954, San Francisco, USA, Legendary Hollywood Film actress Marilyn Monroe prepares to kiss her husband former US Baseball player Joe DiMaggio after their wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So pedantic and cautious was the old ‘marriage of reason’ that one of the features of the marriage of feeling is its belief that one shouldn’t think too much about why one is marrying. To analyse the decision feels ‘un-Romantic’. To write out charts of pros and cons seems absurd and cold. The most Romantic thing one can do is just to propose quickly and suddenly, perhaps after only a few weeks, in a rush of enthusiasm – without any chance to do the horrible ‘reasoning’ that guaranteed misery to people for thousands of years previously. The recklessness at play seems a sign that the marriage can work, precisely because the old kind of ‘safety’ was such a danger to one’s happiness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: We don’t go to Schools of Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The time has come for a third kind of marriage. The marriage of psychology. One where one doesn’t marry for land, or for ‘the feeling’ alone, but only when ‘the feeling’ has been properly submitted to examination and brought under the aegis of a mature awareness of one’s own and the other’s psychology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-713" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/LOVE1.jpg" alt="School children walk behind three-dimens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Presently, we marry without any information. We almost never read books specifically on the subject, we never spend more than a short time with children, we don’t rigorously interrogate other married couples or speak with any sincerity to divorced ones. We go into it without any insightful reasons as to why marriages fail – beyond what we presume to be the idiocy or lack of imagination of their protagonists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the age of the marriage of reason, one might have considered the following criteria when marrying:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- who are their parents</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how much land do they have</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how culturally similar are they</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Romantic age, one might have looked out for the following signs to determine rightness:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one can’t stop thinking of a lover</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one is sexually obsessed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one thinks they are amazing</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- one longs to talk to them all the time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need a new set of criteria. We should wonder:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how are they mad</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one raise children with them</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one develop together</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- how can one remain friends</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: We want to freeze happiness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have a desperate and fateful urge to try to make nice things permanent. We want to own the car we like, we want to live in the country we enjoyed as a tourist. And we want to marry the person we are having a terrific time with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We imagine that marriage is a guarantor of the happiness we’re enjoying with someone. It will make permanent what might otherwise be fleeting. It will help us to bottle our joy – the joy we felt when the thought of proposing first came to us: we were in Venice, on the lagoon, in a motorboat, with the evening sun throwing gold flakes across the sea, the prospect of dinner in a little fish restaurant, our beloved in a cashmere jumper in our arms… We got married to make this feeling permanent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-704" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn.jpg" alt="Katharine Hepburn" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, there is no causal necessary connection between marriage and this sort of feeling. The feeling was produced by Venice, a time of day, a lack of work, an excitement at dinner, a two month acquaintance with someone… none of which ‘marriage’ increases or guarantees.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marriage doesn’t freeze the moment at all. That moment was dependent on the fact that you had only known each other for a bit, that you weren’t working, that you were staying in a beautiful hotel near the Grand Canal, that you’d had a pleasant afternoon in the Guggenheim museum, that you’d just had a chocolate gelato…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting married has no power to keep a relationship at this beautiful stage. It is not in command of the ingredients of our happiness at that point. In fact, marriage will decisively move the relationship on to another, very different moment: to a suburban house, a long commute, two small children. The only ingredient in common is the partner. And that might have been the wrong ingredient to bottle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Impressionist painters of the nineteenth century had an implicit philosophy of transience that points us in a wiser direction. They accepted the transience of happiness as an inherent feature of existence and could in turn help us to grow more at peace with it. Sisley’s painting of a winter scene in France focuses on a set of attractive but utterly fugitive things. Towards dusk, the sun nearly breaks through the landscape. For a little time, the glow of the sky makes the bare branches less severe. The snow and the grey walls have a quiet harmony; the cold seems manageable, almost exciting. In a few minutes, night will close in.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-705" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wateringplace.jpg" alt="wateringplace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Impressionism is interested in the fact that the things we love most change, are only around a very short time and then disappear. It celebrates the sort of happiness that lasts a few minutes, rather than years. In this painting, the snow looks lovely; but it will melt. The sky is beautiful at this moment, but it is about to go dark. This style of art cultivates a skill that extends far beyond art itself: a skill at accepting and attending to short-lived moments of satisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The peaks of life tend to be brief. Happiness doesn’t come in year-long blocks. With the Impressionists to guide us, we should be ready to appreciate isolated moments of everyday paradise whenever they come our way, without making the mistake of thinking them permanent; without the need to turn them into a ‘marriage’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: We believe we are special</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The statistics are not encouraging. Everyone has before them plenty of examples of terrible marriages. They’ve seen their friends try it and come unstuck. They know perfectly well that – in general – marriages face immense challenges. And yet we do not easily apply this insight to our own case. Without specifically formulating it, we assume that this is a rule that applies to other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because a raw statistical chance of one in two of failing at marriage seems wholly acceptable, given that – when one is in love – one feels one has already beaten far more extraordinary odds. The beloved feels like around one in a million. With such a winning streak, the gamble of marrying a person seem entirely containable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We silently exclude ourselves from the generalisation. We’re not to be blamed for this. But we could benefit from being encouraged to see ourselves as exposed to the general fate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Nine: We want to stop thinking about Love</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before we get married, we are likely to have had many years of turbulence in our love lives. We have tried to get together with people who didn’t like us, we’ve started and broken up unions, we’ve gone out for endless parties, in the hope of meeting someone, and known excitement and bitter disappointments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No wonder if, at a certain point, we have enough of all that. Part of the reason we feel like getting married is to interrupt the all-consuming grip that love has over our psyches. We are exhausted by the melodramas and thrills that go nowhere. We are restless for other challenges. We hope that marriage can conclusively end love’s painful rule over our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-707" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/gaywedding.jpg" alt="Wedding Bells Ring For Same Sex Couple In Washington, D.C." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can’t and won’t: there is as much doubt, hope, fear, rejection and betrayal in a marriage as there is in single life. It’s only from the outside that a marriage looks peaceful, uneventful and nicely boring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">****</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Preparing us for marriage is, ideally, an educational task that falls on culture as a whole. We have stopped believing in dynastic marriages. We are starting to see the drawbacks of Romantic marriages. Now comes the time for psychological marriages.</span></p>
