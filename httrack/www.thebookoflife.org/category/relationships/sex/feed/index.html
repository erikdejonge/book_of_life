				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At moments of low self-esteem, it can be hard to avoid the fear that we may &#8211; and this might explain certain relationship hiccups &#8211; be really quite ‘bad in bed’. Three anxieties tend to predominate:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- that our bodies are not attractive enough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- that we don’t practice or know about certain positions</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and that we tire too easily</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9094" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15224067403_ec01b04f6c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These fears reflect an underlying view that sex is predominantly an athletic or aerobic activity &#8211; and that therefore ‘good sex’ must hinge on a capacity to flex our bodies optimally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this risks misunderstanding what lies at the core of eroticism, for though sex traditionally makes use of our bodies, sexual pleasure may more accurately be thought of as stemming from certain manoeuvres of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As new technology is showing us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is quite possible for two people to generate extraordinary eroticism while their bodies are a continent or more apart.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10503006553_e3026821e8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9097" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/10503006553_e3026821e8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C552" alt="10503006553_e3026821e8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s because eroticism is &#8211; in truth &#8211; about something else entirely: ideas. Being a good lover is first and foremost a skill of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sex grows pleasurable the more it functions as a release from a great many of the ideas of what is normal that dominate in non-sexual life. Good sex allows us to admit to, and share, a maximal amount of what we must normally keep hidden.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In good sex, we will &#8211; for example &#8211; be allowed to show that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We’re more interested in controlling and dominating someone that we normally let on</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Or conversely that we’re very keen to submit and be entirely weak</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might want to subvert the hierarchies of normal life by exploring scenarios of pilots and cabin attendants, professors and students, patients and doctors</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might confess that, though monogamous by nature, the idea of other people watching us or joining us excites us really rather a lot</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5611721195_8c0d367312_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9092" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5611721195_8c0d367312_z.jpg?resize=635%2C604" alt="5611721195_8c0d367312_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Or we may reveal that our erotic interests don’t actually &#8211; as they’re meant to &#8211; circle exclusively around genitals; that we’re really pretty interested in more incidental things like wrists or the back of necks or indeed shoes or tights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- We might be brave enough to challenge the normal chronological rules, revealing that we’d like to spend a hugely long time with our clothes still on &#8211; or indeed rush straight in without decorum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sexiness is the excitement of feeling released from the restrictive taboos of the rest of our lives. It’s a safe, mutually caring place where we can take someone else into the not entirely responsible, somewhat cruel and mad sides of us.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7556699760_38f5447be5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9100" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/7556699760_38f5447be5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C377" alt="7556699760_38f5447be5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That someone gives us permission to do this, that is at the core of what sexiness is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person who is good in bed isn’t the one who knows how to articulate themselves rhythmically for extended periods: it’s the person who encourages, endorses and legitimates our secret lonely selves at the same time as being very aware of, and honest about, their own private wishes and enthusiasms. It’s about a mutual nakedness of the mind, made possible through trust.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being in a relationship where it doesn’t feel like there is enough sex sounds like a trivial and somewhat comedic luxury problem, as though someone were complaining there wasn’t enough tennis or yoga between a couple.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But an absence of sex isn’t trivial in the least, it is humblingly serious and might even be what either guarantees or dooms the relationship itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One statistic stands out. In an average year in the OECD countries, 70% of those who initiated divorce cited a lack of sex as the first or second reason for parting. If there’s one generalisation we can make about couples, it’s that a lack of sex &#8211; by which we mean, less than four times a month &#8211; is an alarm bell we should listen to.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6554108407_1e12449aaa_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8938" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6554108407_1e12449aaa_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6554108407_1e12449aaa_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is sex such a key part of keeping two people close?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because in sex, two people accept each other in the most profound of ways. The apparently dirty and shameful sides of us, the wayward fantasies and the unusual longings, are legitimated through sex. Someone else witnesses and accepts us as bodily and psychological beings. Sex symbolises an end to loneliness and a reaffirmation of trust. Not daring or wanting to have sex with a partner is tantamount to admitting that one can&#8217;t be oneself in their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of sex is bad enough, but far worse is the way in which the unreciprocated longing for sex manifests itself. Typically, the person who wants it:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- doesn’t ask very clearly: maybe merely sliding a hand over in a timid, half-hearted search for reciprocation</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8951" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4729125194_1d5a2d68c3_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- they don’t complain calmly, don’t deliver an eloquent self-confident speech about how difficult they are finding it &#8211; and don’t enquire sympathetically as to what might be going on in the partner</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- they tend to quickly move on to symptomatic behaviour wherein their disappointment and sense of humiliation are acted out rather than discussed: they bang dishes. They get mean. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A whole raft of conflicts then develops that has ostensibly nothing to do with sex and yet is caused by its absence. One starts squabbling over the in-laws and the state of the kitchen. The one who has been let down sexually behaves so badly, they start to seem like a monster; further reducing the chance of sex ever taking place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, the sex starved party may simply go off on and have an affair, not because they don’t love their partner, but because showing their desire has become so fraught with rejection that they are out for a bit of revenge.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175348183_561b1cf170_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8944" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175348183_561b1cf170_b.jpg?resize=635%2C618" alt="6175348183_561b1cf170_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack-of-sex discussion is so hard to have because, quite simply, it feels so shameful to be unwanted sexually. It plays into every worst fear about unacceptability. It’s bad enough when it happens on a date, it’s even sadder to have to admit that one is being rejected by one’s partner inside the apparent safety and commitment of a long-term relationship. Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with them, but far more likely, there&#8217;s something revolting about us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key to a process of reconciliation is to reign in one’s wilder feelings of rejection and self-disgust &#8211; in order to be able to consider why the other party might have gone off sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key fact: everyone wants sex in principle. When it isn’t wanted, it’s because a condition for sex is not being met, and then not communicated. Privately, the sex-rejecting party has a problem they are not sharing. They might in secret be thinking: I might have sex:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if only you listened more to my problems with my family</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you gave me more time to do my work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you weren’t so mean to me around domestic chores</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be kinkier reasons: I’d have more sex if: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- you allowed me to play out certain fantasies</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you were more broad minded about role playing </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- if you were more into kissing</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or wanted it rough</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- or could be more submissive.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4987626744_9ff76e1571_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8953" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/4987626744_9ff76e1571_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="DSC_3966 copy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The person being denied sex hasn’t usually had any chance to hear these reasons in plain unaccusing gentle terms. Or maybe they’ve heard them without a sober awareness of what is really at stake here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s been no proper communication. Therefore, a classic recommendation, deliberately artificial, is that the two parties &#8211; aware that their entire relationship probably depends on getting this right &#8211; should write each other a letter, titled simply: ‘What I want from sex.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a chance to be deeply honest about your true sexual identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is then incumbent on both parties to take the other’s words seriously and in good faith.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two people are always going to be a bit sexually incompatible &#8211; but we should not get so scared and angry at this that we create a secondary barrier of hurt, punishment and shame.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8947" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C540" alt="6302715460_03aecb4fcc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should take the first steps to finding a way in which what you want and what they want can in a modest way be harmonised – and the sarcasm and banged dishes can stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every time such a conversation about sex happens in the quiet of the night, the angels of relationships hover over the bedroom and sound their silent trumpets in celebration &#8211; because another couple have just critically improved their chances of lasting a little longer together.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too often, affairs are seen as the outcome of random horniness &#8211; or just plain old nastiness.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s very rarely the case. When it comes to affairs, we spend far too long being incensed or secretive, and far too little time trying to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, affairs stem from a very fiddly aspect of our romantic psychology.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175347625_a41657c6b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8919" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/6175347625_a41657c6b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6175347625_a41657c6b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our relationships with a partner, all of us need carefully calibrated mixtures of two different ingredients. We have A Need for Closeness and A Need for Distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want, in part a Closeness where we can hug, touch, be cosy, intimate and entirely relaxed and at home with someone. We want them to know our thoughts and to wander freely in their minds too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we also need Distance enough not to feel cloyingly submerged, subsumed or owned by another. We want to retain a sense of freedom. We need a private room to which we alone have the key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any imbalances, towards Over- Closeness or Over- Distance, will prove catastrophic if left unaddressed.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/915591764_3a755d1b13_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8921" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/915591764_3a755d1b13_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="915591764_3a755d1b13_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a relationship which threatens to lean perilously towards over-closeness, we can be driven to stray by a powerful urge to prove to ourselves that not everything we do and are is owned by the partner; that we remain desirable to the world and a going concern in and of ourselves. Going to bed with a new person might not be simply about lust: it’s about escaping the alarming feeling that one’s whole identity appears to be dissolving into the couple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But too much distance can undermine fidelity no less powerfully. The distance reads like constant rejection: when we try to touch the partner, they move away or sigh. When we bring up something personal, they change the subject. We may end up having an affair, not because we don’t love the partner any more but precisely because we do &#8211; and yet the distance they appear to be imposing on us through their lack of engagement feels unendurable and humiliating. It’s the final irony that &#8211; if caught &#8211; we’ll be accused of not caring, when it was caring too much that might have inspired the whole mistaken escapade in the first place.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10613938613_08411a938d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8923" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/10613938613_08411a938d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="10613938613_08411a938d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tragically, two people almost never enter a relationship with the same needs for Distance and Closeness. That’s why in every couple, we invariably hear the accusation that one person is too ‘clingy’ and another is ‘cold’. These are unhelpfully vicious words for what are, at heart, just two different ways of feeling comfortable in love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s therefore an early imperative in any relationship to work out what the relative needs for Distance and Closeness are, to air the disjuncture, not to get angry about it, and mutually and with good humour to apologise for one’s distinctive contribution to it. Only thus can we hope to ensure that the gap won’t lead &#8211; in an online chat, at a bar or at a conference &#8211; to a situation where only an affair feels like a plausible solution to the vexing problems of Distance and Closeness.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in a position of not having much sex. Often we stop trying because of something that goes a bit wrong, perhaps there were some nasty arguments or moments of impotence or some awkwardness or discomfort. But what&#8217;s worse is that failure in the past puts us off from ever really trying again. We become avoidant or shy around the whole topic and then the situation gets really fraught because a lack of physical contact quickly destroys trust and intimacy.</p>

<p>Impotence has been turned into a major medical problem and diagnosed as a psychological mishap of the first order. But it is also a very intriguing phenomenon that could throw a flattering light on its sufferers.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It could seem like a strange topic to be discussing. It doesn&#8217;t come up much in polite company.</p>
<p>Yet we know that as many as 35 per cent of US and UK males under 50 will be struggling with it to a degree they themselves find somewhat dispiriting in reflexive moments. In its most extreme form, using up hour after hour, it starts to sap relationships, motivation and sheer well-being.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/21157660909_2dc86c5346_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9820" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/21157660909_2dc86c5346_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="21157660909_2dc86c5346_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The first move is to insist that the problem is neither ridiculous nor unfathomable. It starts with a simple design flaw in our brains: brains that evolved to respond powerfully to stimuli &#8211; like sexual attraction or sugar &#8211; in conditions where these were very scarce indeed.</p>
<p>These brains just never acquired a capacity for self-control commensurate with the temptations offered by the modern, technologically enhanced world. Levels of discipline that were at one point entirely adequate to deal with sexual opportunities in the small villages of the East African grasslands just can’t cope with galleries filled with images of millions of highly fertile well-proportioned digitised naked people. Why ever do anything other than look?</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9861" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health.jpg?resize=621%2C466" alt="porn-addiction-is-not-for-mental-health" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The problem we have around porn is identical to that we can develop around food: brains that were geared to take quick advantage of the occasional presence of something pleasurable are now defenceless before the boundless artificial sweeteners turned out by our remorseless technologies.</p>
<p>People don’t spend hours looking at pornography on the screen because they are ‘bad’, but because the porn is so very ‘good’, that is devilishly well-adapted to breaking down all arguments against it.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14700571442_634f49094a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9822" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14700571442_634f49094a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="14700571442_634f49094a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Crucially &#8211; in all cases of addiction, it&#8217;s never that we are simply greedy or lusty or depraved&#8230;</p>
<p>The real reason is always more poignant and more worthy of sympathy: we get addicted because we&#8217;re sad.</p>
<p>The business of living is so desperately hard, relationships are so challenging, work often so unfulfilling or boring, family dynamics so tricky and the capacity for honest, kindly conversation so restricted, we may through no particular fault of our own fall into despondency &#8211; of a kind that leaves us extremely vulnerable to the sudden intense highs offered by short films about lesbians trying anal &#8211; or plate after plate of iced buns.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9823" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o.jpg?resize=635%2C456" alt="3582153008_9cd5c0134f_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>What we call addiction invariably has the same structure: a difficult life + a very intense diversionary pleasure + a technologically-induced way of increasing that pleasure to a pitch which breaks our mind&#8217;s natural muscles of self control. The cause of porn addiction isn&#8217;t, therefore, porn: it&#8217;s careers that are fraught and relationships where we can&#8217;t get our point across and essays that are devilishly tricky to author.</p>
<p>The real cure to addiction is hence simple in structure: to find something nicer to pursue than the thing we&#8217;re addicted to.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/bakinglady.webs.com/DSCF7068.JPG?resize=535%2C401" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But of course, that&#8217;s going to be very hard, for comparable highs are not widely to hand. Yet, a chief immediate enemy is shame, which reinforces the feeling of low-self worth that helps inspire the addiction in the first place. It’s therefore helpful to insist on a few points:</p>
<p>&#8211; that addiction is normal</p>
<p>&#8211; that it&#8217;s not our fault: it&#8217;s that of a brain that wasn&#8217;t made to cope with the temptations before us.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9824" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o-1.jpg?resize=450%2C456" alt="6392437495_e15cd5aa38_o (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&#8211; that there&#8217;s no need for self-disgust: the addicted are almost in the majority, though we&#8217;d never know it.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should draw courage from the confessions of others.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should acknowledge the sadness in our lives.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should interpret it with the necessary dignity; holding the pain and incompleteness in mind without fleeing it.</p>
<p>&#8211; that we should use it to power something more relevant to our talents. Reroot the manic energy. Try to heal someone else&#8217;s pain, swap this addiction for another slightly less fruitless one: become compulsive elsewhere.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9825" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2313084345_d7a99b3f1b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And then, a banal but critical point: we should try never to be left alone with the computer when we are in a vulnerable state. Let the rational parts of us structure life so that we will be less at risk in moments of sadness.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>It is simply the ultimate cruel tease that the machine we have to do all our work on also happens to host the magic door to a play land more phantasmagorical than anything the Marquis de Sade could have dreamt up.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Juliette_Sade_Dutch1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9828" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Juliette_Sade_Dutch1.jpg?resize=450%2C666" alt="Juliette_Sade_Dutch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secular modern people often automatically assume that sexuality can’t exert a momentous power over our minds. They’re being too sanguine, and therefore unwittingly rather mean. Online porn has an unparalleled power to get in the way of almost every other rather important and precious thing around – starting with the rest of our lives.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should forgive ourselves for being so drawn to these intense often rather harmful highs in a world that is mostly grey and arduous. But then, with all the will we can muster, we should try very hard to switch off.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The online world is flooded with every conceivable kind of sexual image. A substantial percentage of all internet searches (perhaps as high as 30%) are for pornographic material. Even its detractors have to concede that, by the standards of sheer volume at least, the porn industry seems to be hugely successful. It appears to have tapped into a core demand of humanity, however awkward it might at times feel to admit this.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But seen another way, porn is a major collective failure. Not because it exists at all. But for another reason, that initially sounds very strange: the porn industry fails us because it doesn’t produce <em>good porn</em>. The idea of <em>good porn</em> can seem paradoxical. Many people worry that porn itself is bad – it has surely ruined so many lives, it is an issue of grim conflict in millions of marriages; parents are terrified of their children’s online exposure.</span></p>
<p class="p1">

</p>
<p class="p1">When people eat badly, we don’t try to stop them eating at all. We hope to improve their diet. The aim isn’t to abolish food, just because some food is terrible. We want good food to be more widely and easily available. The same move could apply to online sex sites. We can’t abolish porn. So the goal is to get good pornography. Better porn isn’t stuff that’s even more thrilling or exciting. It is ‘better’ in the sense of being better for us – less at odds with the rest of our lives.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea that porn could, under the right circumstances, actually be beneficial, strikes many people as very strange. But it shouldn’t. Looking at a lot of porn tends to leave us feeling disconnected and hollow. That’s because it doesn’t seem connected to anything else we value in the rest of our lives. It’s merely about sex, rather than being also about other things we care about: like self-understanding, kindness, intelligence and good relationships.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of harnessing sexual energy to the service of higher ideals has not always seemed strange. The Catholic Church, for instance, took very seriously the idea that they might, in their art, place some  important ideas (about the meaning of life) next to some distinctly attractive people. Sex was invited to lend glamour and energy to philosophy.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Caravaggio’s exploration of good porn: </span></em><em><span class="s1">John the Baptist: sacrifice and sexiness</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise ambition of the Catholic church is to get our erotic appetites to work in the same direction as our better nature, instead of in opposition – which is so often and painfully the case. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to accept that there’s always going to be a lot porn. The challenge is to start to make it better. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER PORN</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Change the porn stars</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-120314-pornB111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5907" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-120314-pornB111.jpg?resize=635%2C560" alt="PM-120314-pornB11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ancient Greeks were into statue porn. In this one they have taken a lot of trouble to get the forward thrust of the hip just right; the pose of the raised arm is very suggestive. They were hoping you’d be turned on. But he’s also the god Apollo: the representative of wisdom and skill. He’s going to be really dirty in bed, but he’s got a lot of other things going on too. The statue of Apollo gives greater prestige to a very important ideal. It pictures someone very successful, very admirable and competent – who is also highly sensuous. This ideal was meant to be in people’s minds as they grew up, as they judged themselves and others. The Greeks were presenting Apollo as someone who could combine being sexual with being clever and accomplished. And they were saying to themselves and posterity: ‘Maybe you should be a bit like this too.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have – unfortunately – left porn largely in the hands of people who don’t seem to be much interested in anything apart from sex. To put it more bluntly, the people portrayed in porn often inhibit identification. They don’t look like your friends, or the people who work in the firm you’re hoping to join, or those you’d find it interesting to meet.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/137580810.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5908" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/137580810.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="Adult Video News Awards At The Hard Rock - Arrivals" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Novels really took off in the 19th century when writers started to get interested in realism. The story might be about things you’d never yourself actually do in real life; like walk from London to Brighton, as in Dickens’ <em>Oliver Twist</em> (1838) or manage a failing paper manufacturing company as in Balzac’s <em>Lost Illusions</em> (1843). But it was possible to feel close to these characters, to share their ambitions and fears and to learn from their experience.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/180255988.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5909" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/180255988.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="Oliver!" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This wise development hasn’t yet happened with pornography. The porn of the utopian society would allow us to identify properly with the people involved, and to care a little about them, even if we meet them for only three minutes or in one still image.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might, for example, meet a master’s student in finance who spends an afternoon with two men. In her mind, there’s a battle between a sense of guilt and a craving for exploration (she is especially excited by being shouted at); she doesn’t tell her boyfriend. Or, we might meet a polite chemical engineer who wants to dominate someone, but despairs of getting this to happen in his life. Eventually, he learns to cast off politeness and reconnect with his own ruthlessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As we’ve learned from advertising, the psychological context can be made palpable very quickly. It’s not impossible; it just takes a lot of skill, a quality as yet deeply lacking in the manufacture of porn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.jessicatoddharper.com/data/photos/32_1r17pittsburgh.jpg?resize=616%2C493" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Get a better ‘frame’</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Almost every porn website in the world is in bad taste. The colours clash, the language is aggressive, the site is jumbled and chaotic. This isn’t a minor point. The French publishing house Gallimard takes immense trouble with its book jackets, because it knows that the experience of a book doesn’t begin with just the words themselves. The &#8216;wrapping&#8217; too is a communicative medium that should have to all the dignity of the content.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456903404.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5912" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/456903404.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="GERMANY-NOBEL-PRIZE-LITERATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The same principle should hold true with a porn site. Its design should communicate soberness, goodwill, intelligence and calm.</span></p>
<p class="p1">T<strong>hree: Change the categories of what turns us on</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Porn pays great attention to externals: high heels, canes, skin colour, the size of body parts. But the underlying cause of much of our excitement is really very different. It is overwhelmingly psychological. We are excited by ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At present, porn sites tend to divide up their material according to some pretty basic categories: AMATEUR, LARGE BREASTS, LEATHER and so on. Utopian porn would cast these aside in order to arrange the material according to the psychological triggers of excitement. We identify at least five major ones, around which the porn of the future should be classified.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">i) Loneliness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This category would feature lonely or isolated individuals who we see overcoming shyness, reserve, and alienation in order – finally – to express their sexuality, in a way that encourages us to feel more comfortable with our own desires. Scientific researchers, librarians, civil servants and modest quiet individuals (rarely seen in porn to date) would feature heavily in this category. We would witness them journeying from reserve and innocence to full displays of sexuality. The pleasure of watching them would stem from a welcome sense that our own libido, also often repressed and the subject of guilt, could in turn be liberated and accepted by others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Librarian_working_at_the_Pointe_Coupee_Parish_Parish_library_in_New_Roads_Louisiana_in_1936.jpg?resize=535%2C419" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Sexual excitement might sometimes appear to be a merely physiological phenomenon, the result of hormones and stimulated nerve endings. But in truth it arises as much from an idea as from a sensation: and it is in large part about the idea of acceptance, and of the promise of an end to shame.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-5936" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Blue.jpg?resize=560%2C402" alt="Blue" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">At the core of certain kinds of arousal is a form of emotional reassurance and relief, a sense of freedom that we have been allowed finally to reveal our arduously defended secret selves.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ii) Authority</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life generally demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. But in private, we go through life often thinking that we know what’s good for another person or feeling that someone deserves some rather harsh treatment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>In our hearts, we might like to be very bossy, very demanding and insistent. We would like to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But of course, in the real world, this is made difficult by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status which would allow us to exercise power as we would want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://sierraslilcorner.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/couple-bdsm-couples-pet-submissive-slave-bound-bondage-favorites-fred_large.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="530" /></p>
<p class="p1">So a major porn category is one which allows to fantasise about exercising authority. In sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen; and we can  be as bossy as we like. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of how and when to exercise decisive power over another person. And yet in the porn scenario, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety – because one might be mistaken about another’s wishes, because there might be resentment and one might hurt someone – the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one is left bereft by the violence. The other person accepts one’s violent, extreme possibilities. They aren&#8217;t shocked. Afterwards, there may be love and cosiness, until next time. It is the fantasy that violence is no longer bad for us and others; that anger and aggression can be expended safely, will not make others unhappy, but in fact will be welcomed by them – and that the fury of another will not wreck our lives but, in fact, bring us a kindly thrill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">iii) Passivity</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are taught from a young age that we must become independent and strong. We live in an individualistic culture that constantly vilifies dependence and pushes us towards an ideal of solitary maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it seems, in our sexual selves, many of us are deeply turned on by the idea of thorough passivity and submission, as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won’t have our best interests at heart. They won’t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the deep hope in the erotic scenario in utopian porn would be that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion: we witness the best form of passivity at the hands of an ideally authoritarian person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5915" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder.jpg?resize=635%2C676" alt="A_Blue_Coloured_Monoglove_style_Armbinder" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong>&#8216;Now you can do anything to me. I mean it. Anything.&#8217;</strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kinkiness collects around things that trouble us. Erotic fantasies are imagined ideal solutions to real-world anxieties. Porn has the opportunity to target our problems and minister to them. Rightly used, porn isn’t a distraction. It feeds good moves to the imagination. It has a role to play in our emotional education. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">iv) Seriousness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be extremely exciting when a normally very serious, responsible person reveals a kinkier, more erotic side.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why glasses can, for example, be so sexy. Glasses are symbols of thoughtfulness and gravity. They’re worn by people who seem to have a lot on their plate and perhaps a lot of significant thoughts in their minds. The worry is whether these sort of people have any time for us. They may be too important to pay us and our desires much attention. But when glasses are invited into sex, a natural – and important – anxiety is being addressed and (temporarily) resolved: the worry that thoughtfulness and seriousness on the one hand, and bodily excitement on the other might be incompatible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The imagined solution is that the person in glasses can turn out to be not only thoughtful but also extremely interested in sex and the body. Sex with glasses symbolises that the life of the mind is not separate from that of sensual pleasure, that sensitivity and seriousness can be properly reconciled with, and profoundly sympathetic to intimacy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/80/58/7d/80587d4ceac136b502de63223e4ae004.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="540" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">v) Responsibility</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good porn has a therapeutic role. It ideally helps us integrate sexual longing with the rest of life. Consider a very caring mother in her early 40s, who has slightly lost interest in her husband, who in any case is preoccupied with work and tends to drink a bit in the evenings and isn’t often up to sex.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might need porn to reconnect her to an important, but currently neglected part of herself: more adventurous, less emotionally involved. She doesn’t need to get closer to people, she needs to feel that she doesn’t have to be responsible for everyone. She can be selfish for a minute and the world won’t fall apart. She’d say she’s not interested in porn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3755098i.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5933" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/rexfeatures_3755098i.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Boyhood - 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might need some pretty rough and anonymous porn. She doesn’t need to think of relationships. She needs to enjoy guilt-free orgasms and get back to her hectic, hugely important life a little more at ease with herself and the world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Something similar will be needed by a shy, over-sensitive man who should get a bit more independent and sure of himself. He needs to become more assertive. In adolescence, he became acutely aware of his own sexuality, but didn’t pick up very well on the sexual nature of other people: it seems to him that nice girls (the kind he’d otherwise like to be around) will be disgusted by the dirtier aspects of his own imagination. In conversation he’d of course say he understands perfectly well about women and sex. But in secret he doesn’t have faith.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He needs porn that can reassure him that the sort of women he meets (who are not remotely like porn stars are today) have just as kinky thoughts as he does. He’s got to really enter into their minds – and porn should help him do so. He should see people who have completely normal existences; only they are very generously sharing with him the details of their erotic longings.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                                      ***</p>
<p class="p1">We shouldn’t be negative about porn, just because of how most of it seems today. In 1800, many people offering medical services were quacks. They didn’t know what they were doing. There was a hunger for remedies – however misguided. So ‘being a doctor’ was nothing like the respectable career choice it is today. What changed was the realisation that we needed really serious, thoughtful and honourable people to go into this field. Health was too important to be left to self-appointed peddlers of fanciful potions. Right now, pornography is distracting, distorting and unhelpful. It takes up too much time and it leaves most people feeling ashamed. None of that is necessary. The solution isn’t to ban porn, but to make it better.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re hugely aware of the terrible things that can go wrong around porn in the age of the internet. But the longing for sexual stimulation isn’t going to go away. Given how vast the demand is, and how crucial the role of sexuality is in life, it is tragic that comparatively so little talent, wisdom, intelligence, maturity and aesthetic imagination has been direct to it. We’ve rightly come to fear bad porn, because it damages so many lives. Good porn could help us deal a little better with the complex, tricky fact of being – at the same time – highly sexual and highly reasonable beings.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/briefencounter1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4424" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/briefencounter1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="BRIEF ENCOUNTER, Celia Johnson, Trevor Howard, 1945" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5><span class="s1"><b>Brief Encounter, 1945</b></span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Part of the problem is how keen we are to say, at once, how deeply awful it is. Society moves with unhelpful speed from recognition to condemnation. The only ones who would even think of it are, by definition, only ever very bad people indeed. In an age that has accepted almost every kind of sexual practice, it remains the ultimate transgression, violating the greatest of all contemporary myths: that of the natural lifelong monogamous fusion of love and sex.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet no understanding will come from such a hasty refusal to acknowledge adultery’s full power over the human imagination. Before we can begin to call it ‘wrong’, we should concede that it must also, at some level, for a time at least, for some people (who cannot all be merely monsters) be profoundly enticing. What might a case for it go like?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For a start, simply how normal it is to contemplate. It would be deeply unusual to expect people to grow up in hedonistic liberated circles, experience the sweat and excitement of nightclubs and summer parks, be bathed in images of desire and songs of longing and ecstasy, and then one day, at the command of a certificate, renounce all further sexual discoveries in the name of no particular god and no higher commandment, just an unexplored supposition that it must all be very wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">But why?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be provocative: what if there was something wrong in not being tempted, in not realising just how short a time one had been allotted on this earth and therefore with what urgent curiosity one might want to explore the unique fleshly individuality of more than one of one’s contemporaries? To moralise too swiftly against adultery is to deny the seductive powers of a dramatic amount: another person’s laugh or well-timed irony, a first kiss, a new nakedness – each of these a sensory high point in its own way as worthy of reverence as more socially prestigious attractions, like the tiles of the Alhambra or Bach’s Mass in B Minor. Isn’t the blanket rejection of such temptations a little too neat, an infidelity towards the chaotic richness of life itself? Could one trust anyone who would not, under certain circumstances, show any interest in being untrustworthy?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1776" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/isabelle.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1"><b>Isabelle Huppert in the 1991 film of <i>Madame Bovary</i></b></span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The adulterer is meant to feel ashamed; the betrayed party is encouraged to be furious – with every right to an apology. And yet, from another perspective, shouldn’t the latter sometimes be the one to apologise to the former? Adultery may be the lightning conductor of modern indignation, but are there not other, subtler ways of betraying a person than by sleeping with someone outside the couple; by omitting to listen, by forgetting to evolve and enchant, or more generally and blamelessly, by simply being one’s own limited self? Rather than forcing their ‘betrayers’ to say they were so sorry, the ‘betrayed’ might begin by apologising themselves, apologise for forcing their partners to lie by setting the bar of truthfulness so forbiddingly high – out of no higher creed than a jealous insecurity masquerading as a moral standard.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Anger against adultery evades a basic, tragic truth: no one can be everything to another person. It is only a child who can believe this (wrongly) of a parent. Yet rather than accept the ghastly thought with dignified grace and melancholy, betrayed spouses are encouraged to accuse their ‘betrayers’ of sin. However, there may be only one cardinal wrong: the ethos of modern marriage, with its peculiar brittle insistence that one person must embody the complete sexual and emotional solution to another’s every need.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/happy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4426" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/happy.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">No other society besides our own has ever been so hopeful about marriage, nor ultimately, and as a consequence, quite so regularly disappointed. The needs for sex, for love and for family have never been so insistently and hysterically yoked together. This is the distinctive creed of our own times, an altar over which an unusual amount of pain continues to be daily expended. We’d be better off undertaking a more disturbing and useful thought-experiment: daring to humanise and understand the motives of our all too ubiquitous hate figure: the adulterer.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">If believing in the ideals of marriage is often naive, so too is believing that adultery can be an effective antidote to its many disappointments.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/annak1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4435" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/annak1.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="Anna Karenina - 1997" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Sean Bean and Sophie Marceau in the 1997 film of <i>Anna Karenina</i></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is ultimately ‘wrong’ with adultery is its sheer dangerous optimism. While it may look at first sight like a cynical activity to engage in, adultery in fact betrays an absurdly hopeful conviction that one can somehow magically rearrange the difficulties and shortcomings of marriage through a lie. This is to misunderstand the facts of life. It is impossible to sleep with someone outside of marriage and not violently destroy the things one still cares about inside it – and yet, in case we get carried away with the charms of fidelity, it is equally impossible to remain utterly faithful in a marriage and yet not miss out on some of life’s greatest and most significant pleasures that lie outside the couple.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In short, as the adulterer forgets (to the huge cost of those they care about and who believe in them), there is no solution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1793" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/monica.jpg" alt="EVIDENCE PROVIDED BY MONICA LEWINSKY DURING HIS TESTIMONY TO THE GRAND JURY IN WASHINGTON, AMERICA - 1998" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Monica Lewinsky gets to know Bill Clinton in the White House, 1995</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is no answer to the tensions of marriage, if what one means by an ‘answer’ is a settlement in which no party suffers a loss, and in which every positive element can coexist with every other, without either causing or sustaining grievous damage.The three things people usually want in this sphere – love, sex and family – each affects and harms the others in devilish ways. Loving a person may inhibit the ability to have sex with him or her. Yet having a secret tryst can fatally endanger a relationship with a spouse who is loved but no longer excites. However, having children can imperil both love and sex, and yet neglecting the kids in order to focus on marriage or sexual thrills may threaten the health and mental stability of the next generation. The choice isn’t between happiness and grief; all that is on offer are different varieties of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Helen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4431" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Helen.jpg?resize=635%2C492" alt="Helen" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Helen’s affair with Paris sparked the Trojan War</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Periodically, frustration breeds an impulse to seek a utopian solution. Perhaps an open marriage would work. Or a policy of secrets. Or a renegotiation of the contract on a yearly basis. Or more child care. All such strategies are fated to fail, however, for the simple reason that loss is written into the rules of the situation. If we sleep around, we will put at risk our spouse’s love and the psychological health of our children. If we don’t sleep around, we will go stale and miss out on the excitement of new relationships. If we keep an affair secret, it will corrode us inside and stunt our capacity to receive another’s love. If we confess to infidelity, our partner will panic and never get over our sexual adventures (even if they meant nothing to us). If we focus all of our energies on our children, they will eventually abandon us to pursue their own lives, leaving us wretched and lonely. But if we ignore our children in favour of our own romantic pursuits as a couple, we will scar them and earn their unending resentment. Marriage is like a bed sheet that can never be straightened: when we seek to perfect or ameliorate one side of it, we will succeed only in further wrinkling and disturbing the others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kristen.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4432" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/kristen.jpg?resize=635%2C389" alt="'Snow White and The Huntsman' film photocall, Park Hyatt Hotel, Sydney, Australia - 19 Jun 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Kristen Stewart betrayed Robert Pattinson with director Rupert Sanders</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only cure for infidelity is pessimism. We need new sadder vows to exchange with partners in order to stand a sincere chance of mutual fidelity over a lifetime. Certainly something far more cautionary and downbeat than the usual platitudes would be in order – for example:  ‘I promise to be disappointed by you and you alone. I promise to make you the sole repository of my regrets, rather than to distribute them widely through multiple affairs and a life of sexual Don Juanism. I have surveyed the different options for unhappiness, and it is you I have chosen to commit myself to.’ These are the sorts of generously pessimistic and kindly unromantic promises that couples should make to each other at the altar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thereafter, an affair would be a betrayal only of a reciprocal pledge to be disappointed in a particular way, not of an unrealistic hope. Spouses who had been cheated upon would no longer furiously complain that they had expected their partner to be happy with them per se. Instead they could more poignantly and justly cry, ‘I was relying on you to be loyal to the specific variety of disappointment which I represent.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Too many people start off in relationships by putting the moral emphasis in the wrong place, smugly mocking the urge to stray as if it were something disgusting and unthinkable. But in truth, it is the ability to stay that is both wondrous and worthy of honour; it is not the norm. Fidelity is a heroic achievement. That a couple should be willing to watch their lives go by from within the cosy cage of marriage, without acting on extra-mural sexual impulses, is a miracle of civilisation and kindness for which daily gratitude is in order.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1797" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anthonycleo.jpg" alt="Film and Television" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton as Antony and Cleopatra</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Spouses who remain faithful to each other should recognise the scale of the sacrifice they are making. There is nothing biologically ‘normal’ or cost-free about sexual renunciation. Fidelity deserves to be celebrated as a high point of the ethical imagination – ideally with some medals and the sounding of a public gong – rather than discounted as an unremarkable norm whose undermining by an affair should quickly provoke utter rage. A loyal marriage ought at all times to retain within it an awareness of the immense forbearance and pessimistic, stoic generosity which the two parties are showing one another in managing not to sleep around (or, for that matter, in refraining from killing each other). That is something to feel truly hopeful about.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Why is it so interesting and exciting? Few philosophers have explored the topic with the necessary rigour.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2115" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Origin.jpg" alt="Origin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has to do with loneliness and self-disgust. When we begin in this world, if we’re lucky, everything about us is acceptable and adorable, from our toes to our temples. We lie naked on our parents’ skin, they can hear our heartbeat, we can see the delight in their eyes as they watch us do nothing more accomplished than blow a saliva bubble or suck our fingers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then gradually comes the fall. The nipple is taken away. We grow ashamed of our nakedness. Ever-expanding areas of our outer selves are forbidden to be touched by others. We have no choice but to keep a minimum of 60 or, even better, 90 centimetres’ distance between us and others at all times, to make it absolutely clear that our compromised selves have no intention of intruding into anyone’s personal space. We grow guarded. We become adults, expelled from paradise, unappealing to almost everyone we walk past.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But deep inside, we never quite forget the needs with which we were born: to be accepted as we truly are, in every area; to be loved for just existing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030414-oralsexB.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4629" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030414-oralsexB.gif?resize=635%2C527" alt="PM-030414-oralsexB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hence the significance of oral sex. It sounds disgusting when we think of doing it with an inappropriate person – and that’s the point. Nothing is erotic that isn’t also, with the wrong person, revolting. But with the right person, at the precise juncture where disgust could be at its height, we feel only acceptance, welcome and permission. The privileged nature of a relationship is sealed by an act which, with someone else, would have been sickening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s ‘rude’ – in the best way. Normal life continually requires us to be polite. We cannot win the respect or affection of anyone without severely repressing all that is ostensibly ‘bad’ within us: our secretions, our aggression, our heedlessness, our fragility, our lust. We cannot both be accepted by society and reveal who we really are. Hence the erotic ecstasy (which is more accurately really just an emotional relief) when oral sex permits our secret self, with all its ‘bad’ and dirty sides, to be witnessed and enthusiastically endorsed by someone we like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2118" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sex.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The bond of loyalty between a couple grows stronger with every increase in explicitness. The more unacceptable our behaviour would be to the larger world, the more we feel as if we are building a haven of mutual acceptance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sex liberates us for a time from that punishing dichotomy between dirty and clean. It literally purifies us – by engaging the most apparently polluted sides of ourselves in its games. We can press our mouths, the most public and respectable aspects of our faces, the seat of language and articulacy, eagerly into the most contaminated parts of the other – thereby symbolising a total psychological approval, much as a priest would accept a penitent, guilty of many transgressions, back in the fold of the Catholic Church with a light kiss on the head.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/167118119.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4633" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/167118119.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="VATICAN-POPE-MASS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>From a psychological point of view, very similar to oral sex</b></span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure of oral sex is hence deeply rich and significant. It isn’t primarily about a pleasant physiological sensation at all, it’s about acceptance. It’s about an end to loneliness.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">You are queuing to go through to Departures; one of the guards at security has lovely, almost turquoise eyes. You are intrigued by the way they’re frisking the occasional passenger. There’s a charming, sceptical smile hovering over their lips. You’re hoping they might pick you. One side of your mind is, without authority, racing ahead with scenarios that have no place in a busy, sensible life.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1150" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/security.jpg" alt="Passengers wait at Lyon's airport, south" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re in your sixties, a mother of three, a manager at a large corporation. At the beach, you notice a group of young men playing volleyball. Your eyes almost involuntarily scan their muscular, tanned bodies and you realise you are appreciating their athleticism and youth more than seems normal. You turn back to your book, a little confused and ashamed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1151" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/volleyball.jpg" alt="Men play volleyball on the beach below Sugar Loaf" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">You’re on a train and notice the passenger opposite. You really like that kind of hair: tousled and thick but quite short at the sides. They’ve got very interesting glasses and you can just see the collar of their leather jacket. For you, this has always been a deeply alluring mix. You think about the rest of their body; you imagine somehow sparking a conversation, building a connection and retreating to the bathroom at the end of the carriage…</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1152" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trainwindow.jpg" alt="Landscape From TGV" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Are you – or, even worse, are you increasingly<em> becoming</em> – a bit of a ‘sleazebag’? The possibility can be concerning and appalling. Our era is deeply alive to the dangers of unreciprocated desire, particularly in their exploitative, hierarchical forms: moments when a person uses their position or power to disregard the wishes and humanity of others, and treats them instrumentally, for their own gratification alone.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The terror of this sort of infringement is easily awoken when desire is sparked by strangers who – most likely (for this is the way things can be expected to go, statistically-speaking) – have absolutely no interest in us, and might even be shocked, and sickened, to know our thoughts. Dealing with shame at the possibility of lechery belongs (in a small way) to the art of living wisely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To begin with, the very fact we have this worry is rather a good sign. To be concerned that one’s desires may be harmful or disturbing to another person is a signal of a basic moral sense and, as such, is a vital safeguard and inhibition that one would never want to be without. Truly exploitative people rarely agonise that they might be such a thing. The erotic fantasy isn’t a prelude to forcing one’s unsolicited attention on another person: it is (almost always) a mature admission that nothing is going to happen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Lechery belongs to the larger family of daydreams, that is, wishes that one’s life were richer in possibilities than it is. To be more sympathetic to ourselves, almost everyone has daydreams, for our lives are necessarily incomplete and daydreaming is a highly creative and useful response to profound inadequacy and lack.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The inventor of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, made an instructive observation about babies and daydreams. Imagine a baby who wakes up in the middle of the night. It’s dark and the mother isn’t there and it starts crying. It’s going to take a few minutes before the mother can come along and see what’s the matter. In those few minutes, the baby is alone with its distress. To an adult, it might not seem a long time, but to an infant the delay could be devastating. In a healthy scenario, the baby pulls off a remarkable feat: it is able to imagine the mother being there even when she isn’t; the baby fantasises that it’s not alone, that things are better than they are. And that can be enough to hold things together for a while. Fantasy comes to the rescue when there aren’t better options.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/daydream.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4438" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/daydream.jpg?resize=635%2C592" alt="A girl daydreaming during class.  (Photo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">We should take a modest leaf from Freud’s insight. Even if our lives are OK, we really are missing out on an awful lot. We can only enjoy a few possibilities. We will appeal to only a very few of the people who appeal to us. It would be dishonest to say such things aren’t extremely painful.</p>
<p class="p2">Daydreaming is a safety net that stops us going crazy from a sense of missing out. Rather than worrying only about the risks of escapism and unwanted lechery, we should be equally concerned about what happens when people don’t have daydreams. It is the inability to fantasise that can lead people to act out, rather than, dream their wishes. Fantasy is a critical safety valve. It’s a frank admission of the goodness and appeal of so much that one hasn’t got.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And perhaps we can get more ambitious about the area in which being a sleazebag sits: the field of empathy and imaginative involvement. We call it lechery in part to draw attention to an (unwanted) erotic component. But the act of wondering about someone else can potentially extend more broadly into speculations about what another person might be like, how they might act, how they might respond, how they would speak, what they would feel… – things that are, in themselves, far more holistic and less threatening and offensive. We are in a broad sense far more curious than daily life allows us to be. We always have more thoughts about others than propriety allows us to share.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is in part why we have novels. We think of the novel as a kind of art not because it avoids sex and erotic experience but because it joins up erotic excitement with a broader interest in who strangers are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we fear we are sleazebags (as occasionally we must), the wise response shouldn’t be to try to suppress all imaginings about other people. Instead, it should be to expand upon our fantasies in the security of our minds – and honour our daydreams for what they are: melancholy, slightly pitiful, highly normal, but clever ways of coping.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everyone knows that at the beginning it happens all the time…and then, as relationships get longer, it doesn’t really any more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We say it’s because we’re too busy, or tired, or just not in the mood. But why does this important ‘mood’ disappear?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rex_MODELRELEASE_1425591A1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4947" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rex_MODELRELEASE_1425591A1.jpg?resize=635%2C327" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To understand excitement, we have to go back to the early days, when we were deeply in the mood pretty much every hour. What was exciting was our ability to touch, hold, stroke – in short, possess someone who wasn’t entirely within our reach: someone who was independent and free to walk away from us – and yet miraculously was choosing not to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> Expressed as an equation: SEXINESS = POSSESSION + FREEDOM</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1679" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/148275595.jpg" alt="Cupids with Venus and Mars, by Carlo Saraceni (ca 1579-1620). (Photo by DeAgostini/Getty Images)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thrilling desire to be within and inside the body of another person stems from an active, mesmerised wonder that they’ve allowed us to come so close and, somewhere in the semi-conscious mind, a fruitfully worried sense they might not do so forever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, liking someone means we almost always want to reduce their ability to survive without us: in the nicest way, we relentlessly try to erode the freedom of the person we love. And so gradually, we kill the very spirit of independence that had underpinned our desire at the outset.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s something else that wears away at the sex drive: fear. Odd though it might sound, asking someone to have sex with us generally has an element of risk attached to it. The other person might say ‘no’ or even, at the limit, ‘I’d never want to do <b><i>that</i></b>.’ Sex is a request.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And in order to make a request, we have to feel reasonably safe about rejection. At the start, we do feel that safety because – even though we don’t know our lovers so well – we’re independent: we have our own routines, options and autonomy… If it didn’t work out, we could walk away – so we can take the risk of asking them to act stuff out, the intense compelling stuff, perhaps that one about the sailor or the other about the riding instructor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In time though, the stakes rise. Our self-sufficiency weakens. We give up our own ‘castle’ for the joint home and the ability to run away when things get bad. Out of love, we break down the pillars of our independent selves. We knit ourselves together. We no longer have very much we can squarely call our own any more. We have to make requests of the other person all the time: we want them to buy the sofa <b><i>we</i></b> like, we want very badly <b><i>not</i></b> to go and see their parents at Christmas, we rely on their income while we go back and study for a new qualification…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3359984.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4442" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3359984.jpg?resize=635%2C437" alt="Marital Strife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the circumstances, yet another request seems like it may really be one too many. So we don’t bring up that thing we want to do with the mask or with the long boots. We no longer have the will to lose credit or face in front of our daily negotiating partner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might just be easier to leave things alone altogether and then later to fantasise with the help of that less stressful, fraught partner: the computer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/175100987.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4443" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/175100987.jpg?resize=635%2C346" alt="Thai Tourism" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Strangely, there is one thing that’s almost guaranteed to revive sex: a huge argument with a genuine possibility of separation. Major bust-ups have a curious habit of ending up in the bedroom because they bring back to light two things whose apparent absence had gravely undermined sex. Firstly: the sense that you could both theoretically walk away. And secondly, the sense that you could, though it wouldn’t necessarily be easy, survive independently.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good sex needs this, for it relies on a feeling of freedom and a buoyant self-confidence – the very things that can become oddly so scarce as the union becomes ever more co-dependent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To get back to the thrill of the early days, we need to learn the deepest and best lessons of breaking up, ideally without having to go through the very sad and painful process of actually doing so.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The things that get us (and others) sexually excited can often sound rather improbable and mysterious. On the face of it, Wellington boots, a heavy knit fisherman’s jumper or a car park seem unconnected to sane erotic satisfaction. And yet we know perfectly well that things like these can feel essential to sex.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1603" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/car.jpg" alt="Modified Volkswagen Golf MK.5 GTi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">The surface improbability of the elements that incite lust is not merely a fascinating feature of the human condition. It is a cause of intimate trouble. How can we possibly explain to those we love the many odd-sounding things we want? Why do we even want them? We can be intensely disturbed by the direction of our own thrills. In normal life, we may be deeply opposed to cruelty and violence, and then in fantasy, we find (to our horror) that we are powerfully excited by the idea of being set upon by a rough, gun-toting intruder.</p>
<p class="p2">Sigmund Freud was one of the first people to take seriously our confusion and worries around sex. It’s good that he wanted to help us take sex seriously and was so honest about its stranger sides. But he did this at very high cost. His analyses of why we get excited were deeply contrary to any conscious reasons we might arrive at, often involving explanations pulled from deepest childhood, and made us sound so odd to ourselves that he unwittingly created incentives for further repression. Sex ended up, in Freud’s hands, seeming even more dangerous and strange than before, and hence even harder to talk about in a sane-sounding way to a lover across a bistro table.</p>
<p class="p2">There is no need for further mystery or shame. The suggestion here is that sexual excitement is in fact fairly easy to understand and not at all contrary to reason. It is continuous with many of the things we want in other areas. Though our erotic enthusiasms might sometimes sound odd (or even off-putting), they are in fact motivated by a search for the good, a search for a life marked by understanding, sympathy, trust, unity, generosity and kindness. The things that turn us on are, at heart, almost always solutions to things we fear and symbols of how we’d like things to be.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s analyse a few common turn-ons in this light:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">GLASSES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> Glasses are symbols of thoughtfulness and seriousness. They’re worn by people who seem to have a lot on their plate and perhaps a lot of significant thoughts in their minds. The worry is whether these sort of people have any time for us. They may be too important to pay us and our desires much attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1605" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/glasses2.jpg" alt="&quot;Smashed&quot; Portraits - 2012 Sundance Film Festival" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> Yet many sections of erotic websites feature people in glasses. Why? Because when glasses are invited into sex, a natural – and important – anxiety is being addressed and (temporarily) resolved: the worry that thoughtfulness and seriousness on the one hand, and bodily excitement on the other might be incompatible. The imagined solution is that the person in glasses can turn out to be not only thoughtful but also extremely interested in sex and the body. Sex with glasses symbolises that the life of the mind is not separate from that of sensual pleasure, that sensitivity and seriousness can be properly reconciled with, and profoundly sympathetic to intimacy.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">UNIFORMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We often fear that authority will be hostile to us, that it will not understand or sympathise with our needs. It will simply make our lives irksome and dull. All the things we want to do will be forbidden and we will be required to be tame, uninteresting versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3228" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BA-pilots.jpg" alt="BA pilots and sisters Cliodhna and Aoife Duggan" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> A sexual fantasy involving people in uniforms is an imagined solution to fears around authority. All kinds of uniform are capable of sparking excitement: most often business suits but also the outfits of doctors, nurses and pilots… These are the professions that scare and intimidate us, but in our sexual games, we invite the uniform in to reduce their power over us. The uniform still stands for authority but now authority has moved to our side, paying us exactly the right kind of attention. The pilot, far from being impassively at the controls, is thrilled to be here with us, she is no longer our enemy but our collaborator.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ideal which we are seeing, played out in an erotic context, is that authority might help rather than hinder us, reassure rather than intimidate us. We are, as it were, imagining a utopia in which strength, organisation, neatness and order are there to make us feel more at ease, more relaxed and truer to ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SLAVERY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We are taught from a young age that we must become independent. We live in an individualistic culture that constantly vilifies dependence and pushes us towards an ideal of solitary maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1607" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rope.jpg" alt="Venus Erotic Fair 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> And yet it seems, in our sexual selves, many of us are deeply turned on by the idea of thorough passivity and submission, as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life. Being a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do, will take full responsibility, will take choice away from you. This can sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (or even just most bosses) are awful. They won’t have our best interests at heart. They won’t be kind. So we want to be independent in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our submission.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the deep hope in the erotic scenario is that at last we can be with someone who is worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a common feature of all sexual fantasies that they do not – of course – genuinely solve the problems from which they draw their excitement. But we shouldn’t worry if the fantasy fails to solve the problem in reality. What we’re looking for here is simply a way of explaining and sympathising with the desire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DOMINATION</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> Modern life demands extreme politeness and restraint. We have to keep our bossiness in check. Of course, in private, we go through life often thinking that we know what’s good for another person or feeling that someone deserves some rather harsh treatment.  In our hearts, we might like to be very bossy, very demanding and insistent. We would like to enforce absolute obedience on all those who defy us. But of course, in the real world, this is made difficult by the  fact that very few people trust us to exercise such power; we simply are not able to rise to the status which would allow us to exercise power as we would want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1608" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/snm.jpg" alt="Dungeon Dwellers And Domination Enthusiasts Descend On DomconLA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> The fantasy is that someone else will acknowledge our strength and wisdom, will recognise our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them. No more need for restraint, no more need to hold our tongue. In the sexual fantasy, someone puts themselves in our hands, as we always hoped might happen. This is an attempt to address the very delicate, and very real problem, of when one is right to exercise decisive power over another person. And now in the sexual game, instead of this being a situation fraught with anxiety – because one might be mistaken about another’s wishes, because there might be resentment, because one might hurt someone – the commands are met only with delight by the person on whom they are exercised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">VIOLENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> In childhood, we were able to jump around and hit one another a bit and that was fine, even great fun. But now in adulthood, we are infinitely more circumspect. All violence is prohibited. We are terrified of force, against us or by us.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1609" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boysplaying.jpg" alt="Two boys wrestling" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> But in daydreams: it can be nice to take a swipe, to have someone hit you; they could get rough; and you could get forceful. It would be violent, there’d be a savage edge. And yet, magically, no one would really be harmed. No one would be left bereft. The other person would accept one’s violent, extreme possibilities. They wouldn’t be shocked. One wouldn’t have to be so careful; afterwards there would be love and cosiness, till next time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the fantasy that violence is no longer bad for us and others; that our anger and aggression can be expended safely, will not make others unhappy, but in fact will be welcomed by them – and that the fury of another will not wreck our lives but, in fact, bring us a kindly thrill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">OUTDOOR/PUBLIC SEX</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Anxiety:</strong> We easily become shy about the public realm; we sense that we have to be guarded, on our best behaviour: out there in the elevators, public plazas, shopping centres, garage forecourts of the world. Even nature is seen as quite hostile – a cold, dangerous place where enemies may set upon us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/elevator1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4445" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/elevator1.jpg?resize=634%2C536" alt="Spaniard David Molina (R) comes across I" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>The Erotic:</strong> So the longing arises that we could be as much at ease in the outdoors, in public and in nature, as we can be at home. It would be a solution to a kind of oppression to have sex in the elevator, in the library stacks, out behind the petrol station, in the park… Sex outdoors is pleasurable for the same reasons as picnics are: they are ways of taming the world by taking the domestic out into it. Any activity which has become linked to indoors can be blissful when done outside because it symbolises a conquest of our anxieties – it is a way of imagining being more at home in the world than we normally can be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One can analyse almost any so-called fetish (shyness, cardigans, flat shoes, boots, cigars, stockings, striped socks etc.) and find similar structures: an anxiety and a corresponding longing, to which an erotic charge has become connected.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Looked at like this, sexual scenarios can be explained to ourselves – and, crucially to other people in our lives – in fairly rational, sensible terms. We can take people into our history: we can explain how our fear that sensitivity and seriousness had to be disdainful of the body was formed. We can tell them how, when we were adolescents, there were some instances that really seemed to make this idea problematic, how we got searching for a solution to it, and how glasses got involved.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By talking like this, we can hope that sexual tastes will become less a little shameful and a little less threatening – and our erotic solutions a bit more reasonable and, in their own way, a lot more logical.</span></p>
