				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are outstanding lawyers, not so much in professional contexts, as in our personal relationships. We know exactly how to do two ‘lawyerly’ things extremely well: make our opponents look like idiots and exonerate ourselves. Unfortunately, our courtroom talents &#8211; however dazzling &#8211; don’t really get us anywhere in the long term, because the point of a relationship isn’t to humiliate and ridicule a defendant, but to feel safe around, and close to a partner.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/anglotopia.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/04law-span-articleLarge.jpg?resize=600%2C365" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>Relationships aren&#8217;t about being &#8216;right&#8217;, they&#8217;re about mutual understanding. In order to foster harmony, we need to tame our inner lawyers and harness their talents towards more fruitful ends. With this aim in mind, we should consider performing a new exercise we’ve called a <strong>Couple Courtroom Game</strong>, a game in which we task our inner lawyers with an unfamiliar challenge: ceasing to represent us and taking on a new and unusual client: our partners. Rather than making us look good, as they know how to do so thoroughly and with such dogged energy, our inner lawyers should for a time dare to represent our partners in their stand-offs against us. It&#8217;s a way of doing something we generally loathe: seeing things through another&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5762466757_08468bb627_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8829" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5762466757_08468bb627_z.jpg?resize=635%2C369" alt="5762466757_08468bb627_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To perform the exercise, we need to pick on an area of struggle (perhaps it&#8217;s the fight you have about plans for Christmas or the temperature for the bedroom) and proceed with the help of the following courtroom notes, drawn up for use by prosecutors who have for a time become defendants:</span></p>
<p><em><strong>How to Defend Your Former Opponent</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trials should last around fifteen minutes and have at their heart one of the countless issues that bedevil couples.</span></p>
<p>1. TRY TO FRAME YOUR NEW CLIENT AS, FOR ONCE, REASONABLE</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are &#8211; normally &#8211; experts in making our partners look insane because of what they believe and want from us. Their demands (that we stay in more, go out more, have more sex, have less sex, see less family, see more family etc…) spur us on to frame them as lacking in basic reason and decency. They are, as we love carefully to present them to the jury, just crazy.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8835" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C495" alt="9296069330_dbd92b2a19_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the first move for the newly defending inner lawyer is simple yet extraordinary: we must do everything in our power to make our former opponents look reasonable. We must hold back our normal instincts and try to reframe their demands as at heart decent, perhaps badly or hastily expressed but not devilish, putting the most logical and generous construction on their motives. Simply articulating this in a normal voice, without sarcasm, counts as an immense achievement. Attractive features of their characters have to be brought out, and their behaviour convincingly praised and held up for esteem. This will feel very odd.</span></p>
<p>2. UNDERMINE/NEUTRALISE THE PROSECUTION</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next task is to cast some illuminating and fair doubts on the character and motives of the prosecution (you). Argue, for a time, against yourself.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a) Psychobiography of the Prosecution</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should gently point out that the prosecution is clearly not entirely balanced and rational themselves. They have issues of their own. If one is honest, they might have some</span> rather disturbed or damaged motives for holding their particular view, springing from their psychological past. This can be pointed out more in sorrow than in anger. They are seeking vengeance or are compensating for things that went on perhaps many years before the couple first met. They are in key ways attacking the wrong person (because perhaps their mother isn’t there and their father died a long time ago). They are taking revenge on your client unfairly. It’s what psychotherapists call ‘transference’, whereby emotions that originated in childhood are transferred onto adult situations, often without justice. The prosecution can be accused of, in large part, taking out a problem on an innocent bystander.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">b) Polarisation</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good inner lawyer will follow this up by asking the jury to consider to what extent the accusations of the prosecution reveal concerns that the prosecuting party in fact shares with the defendant. Perhaps it isn’t just one person who is stingy, or confused about sex, or ambivalent about family. Anything that your client is charged with probably exists in the other party too: they are trying to make it seem as if it’s all on your client’s side, but immaturities tend to be fairly evenly spread among couples.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9729607890_7b319d3f14_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8833" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/9729607890_7b319d3f14_z.jpg?resize=635%2C420" alt="9729607890_7b319d3f14_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>3. THE SYMPATHY MOVE: NO ANGEL BUT&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, your inner lawyer must make a strategic concession, with a view to touching the hearts of the jury. They must accept that &#8211; naturally &#8211; their client can’t be a 100% innocent. They are no angel, but… they don’t deserve everything, and it would be unfair to make their life hell. They’ve been through a difficult time. They are less dreadful than the prosecution has been alleging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe their errors spring not from evil, but from fear and anxiety. Some of this can be put down to a challenging past. It’s clearly not all their fault: anyone who had been through similar experiences would have ended up here. There are exonerating factors. The defendant is more reasonable and more deserving than the prosecution had ever been in the habit of supposing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, the trial is adjourned, and may convene again for the opposite team to begin a similar exercise. Once it is all over, there will &#8211; at the very least &#8211; be a heightened sense of the basic legitimacy of the other’s point of view, and a good perspective over the forgivable stresses and anxieties that have inspired panic and aggression on both sides. Not least, we&#8217;ll remember that the point of arguing isn&#8217;t to win a court case, it&#8217;s to save a relationship.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Generally, we see other people&#8217;s relationships from the outside. We see couples walking comfortably around the market buying apples or bantering at a drinks party. We hardly ever get to see what they are like together in their trickier moments, what goes on when they get very upset.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By total contrast, we know our own relationships from the inside. We&#8217;re acutely aware of our own times of rage, bitterness or sullen silence. We know so well the intense frustration that builds around tiny things; the ways we hurt one another – not always entirely unintentionally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference between these perspectives makes for a damaging distortion. Our sense of what a &#8216;good enough&#8217; relationship looks like is unfairly biased. We need to help ourselves by having a more accurate, informed picture of normal relationships. In an abstract, light way we know that all couples have their troubles, but we need to see them for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A pretty high level of conflict, meanness, folly and disappointment are standard. They are part and parcel of good enough relationships. A good relationship isn&#8217;t one in which the couple get along well most of the time. It&#8217;s one in which they&#8217;ve learned to accept that appalling difficulties and frustrations are normal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That this piece of knowledge is not yet very widespread explains the ongoing high incidence of divorce. We are not only unhappy; fatefully, we believe that our unhappiness is anomalous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>and a sign of error. We therefore escape our perceived &#8216;unnecessary&#8217; troubles by leaving one relationship and starting another and consequently end up with a different but equally intense set of sorrows (and plenty of casualties along the way).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This opens up a vital function for art: to correct the optimistic talk that we sentimentally hear all the time in order to show us that what we had thought of as a private agony, in fact, belongs to the realm of the normal – and is part of a sane person&#8217;s duty to endure.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art should function as a private repository for truths that are too peculiar and too unacceptable to be shared with people we know.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This explains the value and importance of the work of the Canadian photographer Chloë Ellingson. She has travelled around Toronto interviewing a succession of couples about the challenges that they face in their relationships. We don’t necessarily have their problems, but we have comparable ones and more. It’s not ‘schadenfreude’ to want to listen in; it’s something far more humane and vulnerable: a desire to know we are not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ellingson taps into one of art’s central functions: to hold up a mirror to our darker, more private and trickier sides, in order to heal and reassure us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">John, 31, and Zack, 31</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John_Zack.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5325" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/John_Zack.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="John_Zack" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Zack finds John’s communication style abrasive at times. “John can be very mean sometimes, and I’m a delicate petal in my own mind,” he says. If something is bothering Zack, John’s reaction is to look for a solution, regardless of whether or not that is what John actually wants at the time. “My mantra in life has always been ‘If it feels good, do it, if it feels bad then fix it’,” says John. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">John and Zack also experience tension in regards to physical affection. “Right now Zack and I are in different places as far as intimacy,” John says. “We want intimacy at different times, different intensities, everything from cuddling to sex, we want at different times, and so the result is that we’ve fallen out of sync.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Adam, 33, and Katie, 29</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Katie_Adam.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5326" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Katie_Adam.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Katie_Adam" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Katie and Adam differ in how they value productivity. “I am go go go, and Adam is laissez-faire,” says Katie, “and that drives me bonkers sometimes.” Adam says he looks at Katie as a “beacon of productivity,” but worries about how this difference will play out in the future. “What sits in the background that worries me is that this will become a larger issue at some point in our relationship and it will grind at her. There’s a fear in me that my shortcomings will eventually drive Kate either away from me or just to the point of absolute frustration.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Gabby, 65, and Tim, 58</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gabby_Tim.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5323" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Gabby_Tim.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Gabby_Tim" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Gabby and Tim differ in how they address conflict. Tim says an openness to conflict was not part of his upbringing, and arguing is not something he enjoys. Gabby takes the opposite view. “I’m like a volcano. I erupt,” she says. “And when I erupt I want to immediately deal with the situation, and Tim is the ostrich with his head in the sand and just decides that it’s not worth it, so he will not respond to my outbursts. It’s like adding gasoline to a fire. I just want to fight so badly, and it always happens before we go to bed, and so I’m nattering at him and he’s literally not at all responding to the point where he rolls over and he starts to fall asleep.”</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Kerry, 40, and Brandy, 38</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kerry_Brandy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5327" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Kerry_Brandy.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Kerry_Brandy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kerry feels that Brandy projects vulnerabilities from other areas of life onto their relationship. “The fault line extends into our relationship in ways it doesn’t have to,” says Kerry, who says that after the couple has a conversation about the relationship, Brandy will realise the anxiety might actually come from work, or her relationship with her mother. “One of our newest points of tension is me feeling I have to be the superego all the time,” Brandy says. Kerry will propose fun, romantic and impulsive ideas of things to do instead of following through with responsibilities the couple has, and this puts Brandy in the position of disciplinarian. “I’m the one who always has to say “no,” she says. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Leah, 31, and Chris, 29</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leah_Chris.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5328" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leah_Chris.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Leah_Chris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chris says he finds Leah’s aversion to conflict problematic. When Leah avoids confrontation, Chris doesn’t know what she wants. “How I react to that is normally I’ll get more insular and I’ll spend as little as five minutes and as much as half a day in a zone coming up with my own narrative, or focusing on why this is becoming a bigger deal than it’s supposed to be,” says Chris. Leah’s discomfort with confrontation is problematic because it fuels Chris’s own insecurities and difficulties with trust. “Chris has been with someone who was unfaithful to him, and that’s a difficult way to end a relationship” Leah says. “Obviously it leads to some residual feelings of mistrust.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Leda, 85, and Ross, 85</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leda_Ross.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5330" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Leda_Ross.jpg?resize=800%2C533" alt="Leda_Ross" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ross says Leda is a “free spirit,” while he likes to follow a schedule and plan ahead. Leda says Ross’s approach to life is much more “straight-lined” than hers. “It permeates everything,” she says, especially regarding work on shared projects. “When we’re working together we’re not thinking in the same language,” says Leda.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the couple has been out all day: they’ve been to three meetings, grappled with a failing supplier, cleared up (hopefully) a misconception about tax rebates and sought to bring the new CEO on side with a scheme for a client conference that could have great consequences in Q3 (or could be a bit of a mess). They stood in the aisles of a crowded commuter train for an hour each way and then fought the local traffic back from the station. They were thinking about how great it would be finally to get home, pour a glass of wine, read the children a chapter of <em>The Famous Five</em>, kiss them goodnight, and sit down for a civilised meal and conversation with their most sympathetic ally, their spouse. They are currently, at the end of their tether and inclined to feel (justifiably) sorry for themselves.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/working-mum.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The other member of the couple has been at home all day: once the children had been delivered to school (there was a bad fight in the car), they put away breakfast, made the beds, cleaned two bathrooms, vacuumed the house and sorted out the summer clothes. They organised for a plumber to come and look at the taps in the bathroom; they picked up the dry cleaning. They took a chair to be reupholstered, arranged a dental check up, did some food shopping, collected the children, prepared and gave them a (healthy) snack, cajoled them into doing their homework, prepared supper for them, ran them a bath and tidied a set of ink stains off the living room floor. Now they are thinking about how great it would be finally for their partner to come home and take over, so they can pour a glass of wine, read the children a chapter of <em>The Famous Five</em>, kiss them goodnight, and sit down for a civilised meal and conversation with their most sympathetic ally, their spouse. They are currently, at the end of their tether and inclined to feel (justifiably) sorry for themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-924" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3287960.jpg" alt="Bedtime Story" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The result will be, predictably, an argument, or at least frayed tempers.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Across the developed world, an outbreak of Resentment has broken out among couples.</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a dominant feature of working couples with children in the modern age. They resent one another and feel aggrieved in themselves. Both parties are flat out all day; both are working incredibly hard at various things. But, crucially, neither feels particularly grateful for what the other does. The dominant emotion is resentment. It goes like this:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">One party feels:</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I earn most of the money and yet it’s seen as if I’m out having fun in the big wide world, being creative and fulfilled all the time, pursuing what seems to my partner to be a rather selfish ambition. In fact, my job is deeply stressful and only intermittently satisfying, it makes me very anxious and leaves me exhausted. My mind is on it all the time. If I slip up, it would be a disaster. When I get home, I really need to wind down. I just can’t be expected to take out the rubbish, iron the children’s pyjamas and be endlessly patient with them (and remember the names of all their teachers). In any case, I do my bit. I take them swimming on Saturday morning; I load the dishwasher after dinner. I’m more than helping out. Why don’t they stop going on at me and start appreciating the fact that I’m already contributing as much as I can? I’m furious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141565535.jpg" alt="Artists Ruth Roman, Glenn Ford" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><em>And the other party feels:</em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am at home most of the day, and yet it’s seen as if I might be just relaxing, ‘not working’. Because I’m not bringing in the bulk of the money, it’s as if what I work at doesn’t count. When people ask what I do in my life, I often reply ‘nothing’. My work doesn’t seem to count at all. I feel my partner and the world at large just assume everything gets done by magic or even that I’m the ‘lucky’ one who gets to stay at home. But home is constant labour. Our family wouldn’t last five minutes unless I was at the wheel all day every day. And then when my partner does get home, finally (I feel they might often linger), I’m exhausted but they simply won’t recognise this; I’m desperate for a break, but they go on as if they are the only one in the world who could possibly be worn out – and they refuse to engage with the sort of domestic work that they should be doing 50% of, or at least some of! They just don’t appreciate me and what I do – and I’m furious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Where has this outbreak of Resentment come from? </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To every couple, the resentment feels intensely personal. It is as though their spouse in particular is unreasonable, selfish, obtuse, ungrateful and mean. It’s a special and lamentable failing on the part of the person they were foolish enough to fall for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, the conflict is a general one. It has nothing to do with this or that person in the couple, though this is where the pain is registered. It is the consequence of an idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea was a deeply well-meaning and progressive one, which took hold in the mid-20th century and is now an almost universal law: the idea of equality in marriage.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law states that: in a good, progressive relationship, tasks must be shared 50/50. This means that you both have to earn money (because this is, aside from a practical necessity, the sole route to freedom and fulfilment) and both of you have to take care of the housework and kids (because that’s a chore that it would be deeply unfair if one person had the sole or dominant share of).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The law states that a good couple divides each task down the middle. Equal time on child care. Equal time preparing meals. Equal time on domestic administration. Equal time earning money. Equal time off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the law is nowhere enshrined in statute, it exists out there in the ether, as powerful and as normative as any real law could ever be, defining what is a good and a bad relationship, where a person deserves to be happy and where it is right to be resentful.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The idea of equality was designed to attack an unpardonable problem: that women were for centuries legally and practically denied the opportunity that men had to fulfil themselves through work outside the home and earn money and were forced instead to devote their lives solely to housework and childcare, which may not have suited them at all. Women were told that housework was an ideal target for their talents and paid work was ‘not for them’.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-916" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/housework.jpg" alt="Ironing women" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet many women found housework neither suited them temperamentally nor engaged with their real strengths or abilities. And it was to correct this wasteful and deeply frustrating system that the ideal of equality took hold.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">In the process of getting the ideal to function, two shifts had to occur:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>1. A downgrading of domestic work:</strong> it had to be pointed out that looking after children and a home was not some blissful vocation. It could be a restriction on life’s real opportunities and wasn’t going to be able to offer a person a sufficient outlet for their talents.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>2. An upgrading of paid work:</strong> it had to be pointed out that paid work wasn’t just a chore, it was a route to fulfilment and self-creation, and that everyone should have a chance to sample it. Making money, probably in an office, became the essential prestigious activity across the developed world. In the process, work became seen as something one did for oneself, almost as a kind of pleasure, not a particular sacrifice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this was evidently not the intention, the ideal has opened up vast new areas for resentment. It is causing us real difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in practice very hard for everything to be split exactly 50/50. Someone is likely to be earning more money; someone is likely to be doing more of the housework – either by choice or by necessity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/iron.jpg" alt="Couple doing domestic chores" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And it is this unequal distribution (against an ideal of equality) that is causing couples across the developed world immense problems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person who is doing a bit or a lot more of the housework will feel unfulfilled because they are implicitly told by society that they are spending their time on something low-grade and demeaning. They know they will always be seen by society as second-class citizens, people who do not properly participate in, and contribute to, the adult world. They will not be encouraged to feel especially grateful to their partner for going out to work for money, because (so the story goes) paid work is a route to fulfilment and self-creation, something so wonderful it is close to a selfish activity, for which there is no need to say thank you. Therefore, far from gratitude, the person at home will have deep fears around any signs that their partner, when they return from having fun, is not doing ‘a fair share’ of the domestic chores – and they may resort to low-level criticism (and/or withholding sex) in an attempt to enforce the ideal of equality. Were it to come (which it usually won’t anyway), they probably won’t be interested in the partner’s praise because, according to the norms they have internalised, it’s demeaning to praise someone for doing a low status task. The person at home isn’t allowed, in themselves, to feel proud of having the curtains cleaned, baking bread or replacing the batteries for the smoke alarm. And they will feel awkward about expressing gratitude to their partner for going out into the world and making money. Because the aim is to be equal, the office-bound partner doesn’t deserve praise until they have emptied the rubbish bins and scoured the bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The person who is doing a bit or a lot more of the earning will feel similarly resentful. The money-earner is not, nowadays, encouraged to feel proud of what they do within the context of the couple; they sense that their partner does not especially respect their stressful and intense efforts to bring in money. Their work is just regarded as prestigious and deeply enjoyable for them. However, it often isn’t. They suffer too – and so will resent being treated as if they made no or just a negligible contribution to family life, when they feel they are making the whole thing possible in the first place and suffering rather a lot in the process. But at the same time, they will fear emphasising their gratitude to their partner for their focus on domestic tasks, for this may appear patronising and ‘old-fashioned’, as if they are telling a subordinate class that they are ‘doing great’ in order to keep them in their place, lyricising a task they have no intention of doing as a way of maintaining power relations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>The problem</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the core of the problem is that domestic work has been undervalued and paid work has been overvalued – or at least misinterpreted.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Making and maintaining a home and bringing up children are amongst the more serious, important and demanding of human achievements. They are certainly not for everyone but they answer to vital needs in human nature. Those who do it deserve honour and prestige.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, though paid work can be wonderful, it frequently isn’t; and those who do it deserve a lot of sympathy and care. Most of us do it simply because we have to in order to survive and it doesn’t especially fulfil our souls. It is ironic – to put it gently – that being paid to take a photograph of an attractive kitchen for an interiors magazine, is regarded as a prestigious occupation (a dream job), while running an attractive kitchen in your own home is regarded as insignificant (just a ‘stay at home’); or that being the in-house legal-counsel for a firm that makes domestic appliances is thought a great career; yet using the appliances to clean and cook is regarded as not having a career at all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to equalise prestige and also equalise gratitude. One of the pair isn’t necessarily taking the easy option, the other the humiliating option. Paid-work can be awful and unliberating, housework freeing and ennobling – and vice-versa. So both deserve respect, both deserve sympathy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having equalised the prestige and sympathy owed to each, we then need to move away from insisting that ideally everyone should be doing exactly the same amount of exactly the same thing within a couple (50% housework [chore] &amp; 50% money-work [glorious]). We should divide things far more creatively, in a way that is responsive to individual nature. One person might be doing 75% of the housework and only 25% of the money-work, the other 75% of the money-work and only 25% of the housework and yet both parties could happily honour each other’s contribution to the overall goal: the success of the couple and its offspring.</span></p>
<p class="p2">We should move away from an obsession with brute equality towards an idea of complementarity. People don’t have to do exactly the same things in order to make an equal contribution to a collective ambition. Part of this means recalibrating prestige: going from a concern with an equality of task to an equality of the prestige of tasks. Housework &amp; paid-work both have pleasures, both have pains: both deserve respect and gratitude. The choice of who does what should not be determined by gender, neither for men nor for women, and it should never be automatic or imposed, rather agreed upon as a result of careful examination of aptitude, interest and opportunity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple are a team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Football provides a crucial analogy for role equality. </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Analogies with teams can be helpful. All positions in a football team are equally important and therefore equally prestigious.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/football.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4367" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/football.jpg?resize=635%2C446" alt="Outgoing Colombian forward Adrian Ramos" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The goalkeeper is not less of a player than the centre-forward. The fact that a defender is unlikely to score goals doesn’t mean that they are free-loading. Everyone can be grateful to everyone else – and will understand their respective challenges and difficulties.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To continue the analogy with football, what’s happened in relationships is as though, for generations, being a goalie was thought the worst job of all. Certain people – defined by some arbitrary mark (like gender) – were over hundreds of years brutally required to be goalkeepers and it was seriously frowned upon for them to try to be – or even wish to be – anything else. This repressive tradition was rightly cast aside but it left a nasty hang-over: it looked as if being a goalkeeper was a terrible role in football that no one would ever try to do for too long and that one therefore had to share absolutely equally, among unwilling participants, 8.1 minutes per person, during every match. People who in their heart of hearts wanted to be goalies would always feel uncomfortable and fear they were being looked down on by others and resent the supposedly more glamorous careers of those in other positions – while those in other positions would resist praising the goalies too much, for fear of seeming patronising.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">None of this happens in football because here we have a much clearer sense that we’re talking about a team. The complementarity of roles is well understood. The strength and success of the team depends on people specialising in different roles. It would be a disaster if everyone had to do everything. When people specialise, everyone can feel proud of what they do and grateful to the others for their help.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">What needs to happen</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each person in a couple doesn’t have to do exactly half of every job in order to earn the right to think well of themselves. They need to contribute half of the overall effort; but that doesn’t necessarily mean doing half of the same task.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Modern life has undermined our capacity to feel grateful and stoked resentment. We don’t feel grateful towards those who do money-work (because it’s meant to be fun), and we can’t properly feel grateful to those who do housework (because it’s secretly a bit pitiful and sad). Only 50/50 is fair and because it is so rare (and in practice almost impossible), almost everyone feels resentful some of the time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should upgrade our norms and ideals. Fifty-fifty equality of occupation was never the true goal. It was simply a very good way of moving on from past injustice towards the legitimate aim: dignity for all and freedom of choice around what position to adopt in the team. What we truly want is for people to be able to focus on the things that they’re good at and might want to specialise in. And then we want people to collaborate in ways that allow them to achieve much more in partnership than they could on their own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The roles can never again automatically be defined by gender. Any one should be allowed to stay home and work – or go out to the office and work. And we should no longer be alarmed if a man or a woman freely chooses a role for themselves that was traditionally assigned to them without much discussion on the matter on the basis of gender alone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ambition in relationship life is not that we should live out some abstract theoretical ideal of equality, but that we should recognise that we are a team, which means focus on what makes most sense for us to do – and to say a huge thank you to the other person for their equally large, but very different and complementary efforts on another part of the pitch.</span></p>

They will – by nature – seem absurd to others for they are triggered by what are, ostensibly, very ‘small things’: the sink left a certain way, a remark about when to cross the road, an almost imperceptibly off-hand response to an apparently passing comment… And yet their consequences will be extreme. Sulks might start without warning on a Monday and not be quite done by Thursday, they can be kept going in the middle of weddings and family celebrations, they can survive the presence of small children and office colleagues, they hound anniversaries and birthdays, they are particularly prone to erupt in idyllic locations which one has spent a fortune paying for (they gestate at the nice hotels of the world like bacteria at warm polluted water sources). But despite the amount of time they take up in our lives, remarkably little seems ever to have been written about them, for once they are over, it is hard even to recall that they happened, so demeaning are they to our sense of reason and dignity. The philosophy of sulking is a book still waiting to be written.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, sulking appears to combine intense anger with an intense desire not to communicate what one is angry about. One both desperately needs to be understood and yet is utterly committed to not explaining oneself plainly. Having to explain oneself is indeed the central problem: if our partner requires an explanation, then this is proof they are not worthy of having anything explained to them. Which brings one to the odd privilege of being the recipient of a sulk: one only gets into a sulk with people whom one feels <i>should</i> understand, that is, people one respects. It is one of the stranger gifts of love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1758" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/charlesdi.jpg" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So we sulk with people who should know that you don’t want to talk about your day; that you were upset by the phone call and that you don’t really like that painting or the new layout of the patio – without any of this ever having to be spelt out to you as if you were just one of the others. People who may have been highly articulate all day with colleagues at the office or with small children or relatives will, over a ‘tiny’ matter, suddenly become obstinate and furiously uncommunicative with a partner, because these characters, of all people, should just know. A sulk is a sign of deep hope. One would never bother to storm out of a room, bang the door and call someone a shit and then stay silent the rest of the evening in an upstairs room unless one loved a person really very much indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shelley21.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5035" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/shelley21.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="shelley2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Romantic poets like Shelley are in large part responsible for the epidemic of sulks that stalks the modern world, for it was they who popularised the romantic doctrine that true lovers can see deep into each other’s soul without language. Love is therefore, in this account, the end of all loneliness. In true love, the other person understands without you needing to explain; its greatest proof is that two people don’t have to speak and yet understand one another nevertheless (hence the privileged role of silent contemplation of another’s eyes). Sulking pays homage to a beautiful, and yet in practice catastrophic, romantic ideal of love: wordless understanding.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">People didn’t sulk much before 1800 – because they didn’t have high expectations of being understood deeply, and intuitively, by others. It was people like Shelley who incited sulking, because they promoted the idea that relationships are based on special insights into one another’s characters achieved <i>without conversation</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At some level, the structure of the sulk reveals a debt to earliest childhood. In the womb, we never had to explain what we needed. Food and comfort simply came. If we had the privilege of being well parented, some of that idyll may have continued in our first years. We didn’t have to make our every need known: someone guessed for us. They saw through our tears, our inarticulacy, our confusions: they found the explanations when we didn’t have the ability to verbalise. That was the greatest kindness. It was an effort of love. Then came the struggle to learn to speak, driven in part by the failure of others to understand us well enough. Language is born from disappointment. Eloquence is a sign of how misunderstood we have felt in danger of being, which is why it is an asset that one may be highly unwilling to call upon in love. The most articulate person may simply not want to explain themselves in the confines of a relationship; it seems like a betrayal of that romantic dream of being understood without needing to utter a word.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sulkers are hence the worst of teachers. There is a lesson to impart combined with an utter unwillingness to spell it out patiently to an audience. This tells us something about successful teaching: it helps not to care too much whether or not the audience winds up understanding. A little bit of indifference is a genuine asset for a teacher. Yet because we care so much in love that we are understood (our life is in the person’s hands), we simply cannot react calmly to a minor instance of being misread. Something that would be forgivable in 99.9% of humanity becomes grounds to slam doors and leave rooms in fury. Behind the sulk, there is panic: we may be wasting our lives with someone deeply unsuited to interpreting us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The cure is, as so often, a dose of pessimism. Time always helps because it brings with it evidence of how many other people there are who understand us even less than our lovers: global misunderstanding takes the pressure of its particularly painful local instances. In a more helpful culture than our own, we would be reminded that our partners may be very nice and at the same time very likely to misunderstand, without evil intent, a good number of our moods. Even at their best, they will be mistaken in their interpretations of a raft of our central needs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To calm us down in the midst of a sulk, we should be reminded that it is not really a sign of love for every aspect of our souls to be grasped without us needing to say anything. It is no insult to us to be called upon to develop our eloquence. When our lovers fail to understand, it isn’t an immediate sign that they are heartless. It may merely be that, out of a romantic prejudice, we have grown a little too committed to not teaching them about who we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In an ideal world, we would more readily recognise (when we can manage a compassionate mood) the comic aspect of sulking – even when we are the special target of the sulker’s fury and rage. We would see the touching paradox. The sulker may be six foot one and employed by a major law firm, but they are in fact saying: ‘Deep inside, I remain an infant and right now, I need you to be my parent. I need you to guess what is truly ailing me, as people did when I was a baby, when my ideas of love were formed’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sulk can be overcome when this insane, touching ambition reveals its comedic dimension. We are then in a position to laugh, not because we don’t care, but because we understand how crazy both our lover and the species to which they belong happen to be. We haven’t been cursed with an especially mad example of a person. Even though our partner has accused us of some truly revolting things and is behaving with advanced viciousness, we do them the greatest possible favour when we look at their tantrum as we would that of a one-year-old.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are so alive to the notion of being patronised when considered as younger than we are; we forget that this is also, at times, the greatest privilege. We look beyond the sulker’s callous words and the slammed door. We grasp the real suffering beneath the horrible exterior, we see that our adversary is hurt not mean, and are struck – once more – by how oddly human nature is arranged. But because we understand, we are no longer frightened or angry in turn. The furious, hopeful, deluded absurdity of our partner’s trouble makes us gently smile. We get ready to knock at the door and gently ask if they might let us in for a word.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are – when you start adding incidents up – rather a lot of things about you that your partner seems keen to change. They notice how you put off ringing your mother. They want you to be more adventurous in how you dress. Three times recently they said they want you to get a grip on your finances. They’ve also hinted they’d like you to take more of an interest in the children’s homework and to help to host more dinner parties. It doesn’t feel very pleasant. But, then again, they’re not alone: if you are honest with yourself, there is plenty about them that you would – ideally – like to change as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108432305.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4377" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/108432305.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Ignoring The Wife" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This all feels very wrong. The impulse to alter our lovers appears to run counter to the spirit of love. If we loved and were loved, surely there wouldn’t be any talk of change? Isn’t love about the acceptance of an entire being, in their high and low points?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The idea of wanting to change our partners sounds incongruous and disturbing because, collectively, we have been deeply influenced by a Romantic conception of love. This states that the principal marker of love is the capacity to accept another person in their totality, in all their good and bad sides – and in a sense, particularly their bad sides. To love someone is, quite simply, according to Romantic philosophy, to love them <b><i>as they are</i></b> – without any wish to alter them. We must embrace the whole person to be worthy of the emotion we claim to feel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At certain moments of love, it does feel particularly poignant and moving to be loved for things that others have condemned us for or not seen the point of. It can seem the ultimate proof of love that the trickier sides of us can arouse interest, charity and even desire. Through life, we are always conscious that there are things about us that other people might not like very much – and we try to protect ourselves from scorn and criticism. What excitement then when our lovers seem to treat certain failings generously. When they find you shy at parties, they don’t laugh – they are sweet and take your tongue-tiedness as a sign of sincerity. They’re not embarrassed by your slightly unfashionable clothes, for them, it’s about honesty and the strength to ignore public opinion. When you have a hangover, they don’t say it was your own fault  for drinking too much; they rub your neck, bring you tea and keep the curtains closed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From these moments, an extremely unfortunate conviction develops around love: the idea that loving someone must always mean accepting them in every area – and that being loved must invariably mean being endorsed for everything one is and does. Any desire for change must, according to this Romantic ideology, arouse upset, annoyance and deep resistance. It seems proof that there can’t be love, that something has gone terribly wrong – that one should break up…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is another more workable and mature philosophy of love available, this one traceable back to the ancient Greeks. It states that love is first and foremost an admiration for the good sides, the perfections, of another human being. Love is the excitement we feel when we come face to face with something that is strong, clever, kind, honest, witty or magnanimous in another person. The Greeks took the view that love is not an obscure emotion. To love someone is not an odd chemical phenomenon indescribable in words. It just means being awed by another person for all the sort of things about them that truly are right and accomplished.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508916311.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4374" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/508916311.jpg?resize=635%2C373" alt="Restoration Work Completed On Michelangelo's David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, what do we do with weaknesses, the problems, the not-so-nice bits? The Romantic philosophy tells us to embrace, even cherish them – all of them. We do this with a certain number of them: a relationship wouldn’t get off the ground if we couldn’t. But at a certain point, we reach our limit. Being told we simply have to love someone for all that they are, or else think of ourselves as bad people, is asking too much. How could someone never want to change any part of us if they know us properly? Do they lack all ambition for our true potential? Do we not ourselves aspire to change and improvement? Then why blame them for wanting from us what we at heart want from ourselves?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At this point, the Greek idea of love turns to a notion to which we desperately need to rehabilitate ourselves: <b><i>education</i></b>. For the Greeks, given that we are all very imperfect, part of what it means to deepen love is to want to teach – and to be taught. Two people should see a relationship as a constant opportunity to improve and be improved. When lovers teach each other uncomfortable truths, they are not giving up on love. They are trying to do something very true to love: which is to make their partners more loveable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1644" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/665623.jpg" alt="Bronx School Stands Out" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should stop feeling guilty for simply wanting to change our partners, and we should never resent our partners for simply wanting to change us. Both these projects are, in theory, highly legitimate, even necessary. The desire to put one’s lover right is, in fact, utterly loyal to the essential task of love – to help another person to become the best version of themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, under the sway of Romantic ideology, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students. That’s because we don’t accept that it’s legitimate (let alone noble) to have things we might want to teach and areas where we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover’s education that would enable criticism to be moulded into sensible-sounding lessons and to be heard as caring attempts to rejig our troublesome personalities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead, in the student role, at the first sign that the other is adopting a pedagogical tone (maybe pointing out something that we said rather too loudly at dinner, or a habit that is cropping up again at work), we tend to assume that we are being ‘attacked’ and betrayed – and therefore close our ears to the instruction, reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3199681.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4372" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3199681.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Deaf Musicians" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Correspondingly, when there is something we would like to teach, so unsure are we that we’re going to be heard (we develop experience of how these things usually go) or that we have the right to speak, our lessons tend to come out in a tone of hurried annoyance. We are frightened teachers, because we recognise that we have committed ourselves to pupils who don’t even want to learn and in the process, are ruining our lives as well as theirs (most pupils don’t have as much power over their teachers’ lives as they do in the Romantic scenario, which is why they are generally better). What might have been an opportunity for a thoughtful lesson will come out – under the panicky, scared ‘classroom’ conditions of the average relationship – as a series of shouted, belittling insults met with by rebellion and fury by the student body. We don’t use any of the techniques that we are careful to use when trying to teach a child or a colleague. Here we know to use extraordinary tact, to make ten compliments for every one negative remark, to leave ourselves plenty of time… But in love’s classroom, we are the worst teachers we are ever likely to be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet we should stop judging these faulty attempts at instruction so harshly. Rather than reading every lesson as an assault on our whole being, as a sign we are about to be abandoned or humiliated, we should take it for what it is: an indication, however flawed, that someone can be bothered – even if they aren’t yet breaking the news perfectly (our friends are less critical not because they’re nicer, but because they don’t need to bother: they get to leave us behind after a few hours in a restaurant).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should never feel ashamed of instructing or of needing instruction. The only fault is to reject the opportunity for education if it is offered – however clumsily. Love should be a nurturing attempt by two people to reach their full potential – never just a crucible in which to look for endorsement for all one’s existing failings.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re flicking through a fashion magazine and playfully suggest that your partner might want to make a few experiments with their wardrobe. How about a different pair of jeans or a new T-shirt, a duffle coat or platform heels? But at the mention of this possibility, your partner gets very agitated indeed: they scornfully declare that money is tight, they haven’t got any time, they have too many clothes already and why are you deliberately annoying them by making vapid proposals like this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This response is very off-putting. You only made a perfectly reasonable suggestion and now they are declaring war. You didn’t do anything. Their behaviour seems utterly out of proportion with what triggered it. You may conclude, as you have done on other occasions, that in some areas the person you love really does seem ‘a bit mad.’ This conclusion, though perhaps depressing, also feels strangely satisfying. At least you know what is up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_948135a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4379" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_948135a.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="Couple having serious interaction" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we are all a ‘bit mad’ in ways that preclude such dismissive statements and demand closer and more generous examination. For all of us, there are situations and behaviours which can be counted upon to elicit swift and powerful responses which don’t seem in any way in line with what is happening right now. Our behaviour seems not to fit what is unfolding in front of us. For example, someone we love is going away for a month, and tells us they will miss us very much indeed. They move to hug us. But far from feeling sad and tender, we just register numbness, pull away and can’t say anything other than that the weather is unseasonably chilly today. Or we return home to find there is a bit of a mess in the kitchen, but rather than taking this in our stride, we start to shout at our partner that the house is chaos and life with them has become impossible. Or a friend is only ten minutes late for our birthday party, but we are compelled to send them a text calling them an a**hole and asking them not even to bother coming.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_1443467a-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4380" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/rexfeatures_1443467a-1.jpg?resize=635%2C436" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These sort of behaviours don’t make any sense if we try to justify them simply according to the facts in the here and now (as we and their perpetrators are inclined to do). The clue to them lies in something known as <em>transference</em> – a psychological phenomenon whereby a situation in the present elicits from us a response – generally extreme, intense or rigid in nature – that we cobbled together in childhood to meet a threat that we were at that time too vulnerable, immature and inexperienced to cope with properly. We are drawing upon an old defence mechanism to respond to what feels like a very familiar threat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In most of our pasts, when our powers of comprehension and control were not yet properly developed, we faced difficulties so great that our capacities for poise and trust suffered grievous damage. In relation to certain issues, we were warped. We grew up preternaturally nervous, suspicious, hostile, sad, closed, furious or touchy – and are at risk of becoming so once again whenever life puts us in a situation that is even distantly evocative of our earlier troubles. Perhaps a parent we loved left us for long periods to work abroad. They didn’t mean to but the pain was so intense at that time, we reacted by shutting down our capacities for affection. Our way of coping was not to feel, to grow numb – a response that we keep producing even now, 30 years later, whenever someone we love has to go away for a time. Or perhaps we had chaotic, unreliable parents whom we dealt with by rigidly organising our room, arranging books by size, and reacting with alarm at the slightest bit of dust – and even now, outer disorder ushers in a panicky feeling within that everything is out of control once again. Or we had a sister who was always late to events that mattered to us, or a mother who was both humiliating and obsessed by fashion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1652" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_519423ap.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unconscious mind is slow to realise that things have changed in the outer world but sadly quick to mistake one person for another, seeming to judge only by crude correspondences; ‘someone we love’ or ‘a person coming to our party’ appears to be enough to confuse us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because transference happens without us knowing it, we generally can’t explain why we are behaving as we are. We carry years behind us that have no discernible shape, which we have forgotten about and which we aren’t in a position to talk others through in a manner that would win us sympathy and understanding. We just come across as mean or mad. What we would ideally need is a guardian angel who can pause the present and carry our partners back to another time and place, to the moment when the neurotic defence that we are projecting originated. They’d be able to see the unreliable parents, the chaotic house, the loving but neglectful father, the fashion-obsessed mother etc. – and might be appropriately moved by what we had to cope with before we knew how to.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3249794-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4381" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3249794-1.jpg?resize=635%2C335" alt="Pestalozzi Children" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The concept of transference – and the accompanying idea of projection – provide a vantage point on some of the most frustrating behaviours that we ever meet with in relationships. And they allow us to feel sympathy and understanding where we might have only felt irritation. If we cannot always be entirely sane in our relationships, the kindest thing we can do for those who care about us is to hand over some maps that try to chart and guide one through the more disturbed regions of our internal world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>Transference Exercises </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Key to building up such maps is working out where transference might be occurring. For this, we can rely on ‘transference exercises.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most famous of these is the Rorschach test, devised in the 1930s by the psychologist Hermann Rorschach to help people to learn more about the contents of the hard-to-reach parts of their own minds. By being shown an ambiguous image and asked to say what it was, Rorschach believed that we would naturally reveal some of our latent guiding fears, hopes, prejudices and assumptions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The important point in any Rorschach test is that the image has no one true meaning. Different people merely see different things in it according to what their past predisposes them to imagine. To one individual with a rather kindly and forgiving conscience, the image below could be seen as a sweet mask, with eyes, floppy ears, a covering for the mouth and wide flaps extending from the cheeks. Another, more traumatised by a domineering father, might see it as a powerful figure viewed from below, with splayed feet, thick legs, heavy shoulders and the head bent forward as if poised for attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rorschach_blot_04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4383" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rorschach_blot_04.jpg?resize=635%2C360" alt="Rorschach_blot_04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Or take another classic transference exercise:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Projection-Image.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-5818" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Projection-Image.jpg?resize=255%2C359" alt="Projection Image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">It’s key that this image is rather ambiguous. You can read it many different ways, and that’s the point: to make you aware of your characteristic instances of transference by teasing them out with an inconclusive image.</p>
<p class="p1">Of this image, people might say things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died.</li>
<li>It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee</li>
<li>Or: I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</li>
</ul>
<p>One thing we do know &#8211; really &#8211; is that the picture doesn’t show any of these things, it simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. <b>The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it.</b> And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. <b>This is what one means by transference.</b></p>
<p class="p1">A third transference exercise asks us to say the first thing that comes to mind when we try to finish certain sentences. For example:</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Men are generally…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Women are almost always…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. When I fall in love, what’s bound to happen is…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. When someone I care about is late, it must be because…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5. The kitchen is in chaos, and it’s evidence that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">6. When I hear someone described as ‘very intellectual’, I imagine them being…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because these sentences aren’t about a concrete situation in the present, the only way to answer them is by calling up transferences from the past. Our responses hence give us a clue as to a bias in our minds that would normally be invisibly applied, merging imperceptibly with the dilemmas of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In good relationships, people are ready to accept that they might be involved in transference. Ideally, we should all rationally disentangle and un-distort our transferences and explain them to others in good time. But it rarely happens and collectively we pay a big price for our ignorance. We keep making things tough for everyone by over- and under-reacting – and so our relationships are far harder than they need to be.</span></p>

<p class="p1">You and your partner are waiting, and waiting, at the airport carousel for your luggage. Other people are wheeling their bags away. Soon, you are the only ones left standing by the now empty conveyor belt. Gradually, a deeply unfortunate eventuality becomes clear: your case has gone missing, along with all your clothes and some important documents too. Even if it does turn up eventually, it’s going to mean lots of calls, explanations, forms, hanging around and uncertainty. The already long day has taken an unexpected turn for the worse.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/310647426_90d00c5dbc_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7843" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/310647426_90d00c5dbc_b.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="310647426_90d00c5dbc_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>At this point, your partner says something about how strange it is that baggage doesn’t get lost more frequently, given the number of cases travelling around the world at any one time. The tone is observational and curious, the sort one might employ when trying out a hypothesis about the progress of the seasons. It is followed by a silence. And, suddenly, you realise deep in your heart that you are completely furious with them, furious that they could be so carefree and indifferent and ploddingly standing next to you in their casually fashionable jacket, so not-in-pain, when something like this has happened to you. Moreover, an important piece of logic falls into place: somehow, all this, the waiting around, the humiliation, the hassle, the hapless airline employees you’re going to have to deal with, this is their fault. They are to blame for everything – even the headache that is right now clasping itself like a vice around your front lobes. You turn away from them and mutter, ‘I knew all along that I should never have gone along with your selfish suggestion of this expensive, boring trip’ – which seems a sad, and rather unfair way, to precis an otherwise pleasant anniversary weekend in a foreign capital.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone might quite see, or sympathise with, the connection just made. After all your partner does not work for an airline, is not involved in baggage handling and merely brought up the idea of a weekend away, to which you gave your mutual consent. Nevertheless, we are here circling one of the most superficially irrational, but common and important of all presumptions of love: that the person to whom one has pledged oneself is not just the centre of one’s emotional existence, they are also, as a result, in a very strange, objectively insane and profoundly unjust sense, responsible for simply everything that happens to you, for good and ill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world upsets, disappoints, frustrates and hurts us in countless ways at every turn. It rejects our creative endeavours, it overlooks us in promotions, it rewards idiots, it neglects our talents, it delays our trains, loses our keys and sends our luggage off to far-flung destinations. And almost all of the time, we cannot complain. It’s too difficult to tease out who is really to blame; or even if one knows, one cannot say, for one would lose one’s job or be declared an upstart or impossibly thin-skinned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2261156584_db9eab8433_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7845" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2261156584_db9eab8433_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C356" alt="2261156584_db9eab8433_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The only person to whom we can expose the multiple grievances we accumulate is the person who is closest to us; the one we love. This blessed person become the recipient of all of our accumulated rage at the injustice and imperfections of our lives. It is of course the height of absurdity to blame them. But this is to misunderstand the rules under which love operates. We simply cannot and therefore don’t usually get angry with the people who are really to blame for hurting us. Rather, we get angry with those whom we can be sure will tolerate us for blaming them. So we get angry with the very nicest, most sympathetic, most loyal people in our vicinity, the ones actually least likely to have harmed us, but most likely to stick around while we blame them for having done so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The words we mutter to our lovers undoubtedly sound mean. But let’s at least remember that we would say them to no one else on earth. They are a curious proof of intimacy, a symptom of love itself – and in their own way, oddly romantic (a detail indirectly acknowledged by their frequently sexual conclusions). What relief it may be to end up in the company of someone with whom none of the rules of propriety apply, with whom one can reveal one’s most deranged sides, whom one can accuse of a myriad of offences and yet by whom one could be sure that, once the storm has abated, one will be forgiven. We can tell any stranger something reasonable and polite, but only in the presence of someone we really trust can we dare to be properly irrational and truly unkind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In part, we get furious with our partners because we assign them such a deep role in our lives. We have faith that a person who understands obscure parts of us, whose presence solves so many of our woes, couldn’t realistically also be someone who would be unable to find a suitcase or in a wider sense fix our lives. Claims to this effect are confusedly interpreted as signs of a sadistic lack of affection and care – and have to be punished accordingly (we want to make them as unhappy as it seems they have made us). We exaggerate our partners’ powers, an exaggeration that is an echo – heard in adult life down the decades – of a child’s awe at their parents. When we blame our partners, we are remembering what it felt like when we loved a parent who could effortlessly swing us up to the ceiling, who knew everything, who could find rabbit when it got lost, who always held the tickets and the passports, who ensured there was invariably food in the fridge, who controlled the world… The partner, when loved, inherits a little of that beautiful, romantic, dangerous, unfair, trust we as children once had in our parents. At one level, the lover has learnt how to reassure the anxious child in us – that’s why we love them. But that source of strength also brings with it some very serious problems, for the primitive part of us insists on trusting them a little too much, believing that they actually control far more of existence than they possibly could.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boredcouples.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4387" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/boredcouples.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="SPAIN. Majorca. 1993." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the other side of the fence, when faced with the outbursts of our lovers, we should strive (it is never easy) to remember that these attacks are deeply horrible symptoms of something really very nice: that we properly matter to another person, and that they have become deeply dependent upon us for their capacity to endure the humiliations the world daily accords them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we think of love as perfect agreement, we will feel that conflict must mean that a relationship is winding down or starting to fall apart. But blame is at heart just a symptom of an intensity of investment in another person. We attack because we have richly entangled our deepest dreams and anxieties with another person. It is because we are so very close to them, that they draw us into very private zones of turbulence and distress – from which absolutely everyone else is excluded. That is one of the stranger, more unfortunate and yet (from a very calm angle) almost flattering gifts of love.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many nice things we want, but are somehow a little scared of getting, because they are bound up with risks and subtle inner complications we don’t quite have a handle on: we may – at some deep level – be scared of succeeding at our career, of making money, of going out to parties, of having sex, of doing less of the cooking and cleaning, of not spending so much time with an ailing relative, of living for ourselves…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The burden of these fears is heavy, and while we are on our own, away from parents, we generally have to bear the force of our ambivalence by ourselves. But once we enter a long-term relationship, a pleasing possibility comes into view: we may be able to reallocate blame to those who have pledged themselves to us. We may (if we’re lucky enough) be able to accuse them of preventing us from getting all sorts of things we think we want deeply but are, in our hearts, somewhat conflicted about laying claim to. We end up frustrated, and yet able to throw a highly useful line at our loved one: ‘If it wasn’t for you…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src-thumbnail="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/breakfast.jpeg" src-medium="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/breakfast.jpeg" src-large="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/breakfast.jpeg" src-full="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/breakfast.jpeg" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/breakfast.jpeg" alt="VARIOUS" title="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1058" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine a couple who haven’t had sex for a while. When there’s a chance (a free evening, some wine, a relaxed mood), things start off well. But then two things can be counted upon to interrupt the process. As he begins to caress his partner, she will seem ever so slightly distracted and disengaged. She might wonder whether she locked the back door or ask if he called his mother back. ‘I’m sorry,’ she’ll add, noticing his annoyance. But the annoyance isn’t just minor (both have been here before). He grows furious, accuses her of ‘never being in the mood’ and storms out to the spare room. She asks him to return, but he refuses to re-emerge, saying it’s too late now. The couple spend the night apart. Both parties, sulking alone, are left to think of themselves as harbouring uncomplicated desires for sex. It’s just the other person who created difficulties. Both have the relief of thinking: ‘If it wasn’t for you…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of our wishes are bound up with resistances and fears. We defend ourselves against so much that we want, for there are dangers around success, intimacy, triumph, freedom… Both members of the couple might want, and yet at the same time, really quite strongly not want to sleep together (they picked each other out carefully for precisely this reason). They may have worries about potency, surrender and acceptance. Both parties have therefore skilfully elaborated behaviour (distraction; fury) that will resolutely ensure that sex is unlikely – and yet they’re able to attribute the blame firmly to the other. ‘I was only asking about the back door,’ the woman can sincerely reflect. ‘It’s normal to be furious if someone is never in the mood,’ the man will muse, from the spare room.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src-thumbnail="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-medium="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-large="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src-full="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/window.jpeg" alt="VARIOUS" title="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1059" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or take a very promising student who becomes pregnant just at the end of her degree, totally by accident. She and her boyfriend were planning to get married anyway, but this inadvertent pregnancy puts immediate pay to her career ambitions (there had been talk of medical or law school). The woman goes on to have three more children by the time she is thirty. They are sent to demanding schools, and every afternoon and weekend, there are activities and playdates. The woman never has a single moment to return to thoughts of her own career – everyone can see that. At cross moments, she will accuse her husband and children of placing their needs ways before hers and of preventing her from reaching her potential. ‘If only it wasn’t for you…’ – she would have a great career by now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t that she doesn’t want a career at all, but that alongside her sincere ambitions, lie terrors of choosing the wrong thing or being humiliated through failure (her parents didn’t tolerate setbacks well; her older sister is an over-achiever).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By their very structures, relationships allow for an uncommon amount of blame fudging: whereby one person can accuse another of having blocked them from doing something they were only ever partially sure or convinced they had it in them to want.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img src-thumbnail="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-medium="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-large="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src-full="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/158744294.jpg" alt="Hedy Lamarr pointing her finger towards Robert Young sitting next to her" title="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1061" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To purge ourselves of these patterns, in the silence of our souls, we should face up to our games. Firstly, we should make an audit: ‘What are the things I routinely blame my partner for frustrating me from doing/getting?’ The list might read: finding a better job, seeing my university friends, time to practice the guitar, playing with the children, buying a new car, doing more of the cooking, having more sex… Then one must ask: ‘Could it, strangely but truly, be in some ways a relief for me to be frustrated in some of these areas? Do I have reasons to be scared of, or resistant to, some of the things I repeatedly and eloquently tell the world I so badly want? Am I deliberately creating situations for myself where I will be frustrated, to avoid the difficulties of my wants…?’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unless one is a paragon of mental health, the correct answer will be yes – perhaps creating an occasion for a little contrition before the long-suffering partner (who has, of course, been using us in the very same way over their own set of terrifying desires).</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the things that makes us fall in love with people is realising they can do something we can’t. We get attracted to people who seem capable and at ease with parts of life in which we struggle. Perhaps they are very administratively capable, and we are inept; or they are creative, and we are more procedural. They might be highly sensitive, whereas we find our own feelings hard to deal with.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hope, if only at an unconscious level, is that by getting together with this person, we will learn and develop. Their virtues will change us. We’ll grow more confident or wittier, better at paperwork or readier to analyse our inner lives. Love offers us a vision of growth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7478764714_d09ab413bc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8858" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/7478764714_d09ab413bc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="7478764714_d09ab413bc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But something nasty tends to happen to this promise of development along the years. A person’s so-called strengths have an unfortunate habit of turning, in the beholder’s eyes, into something excessive and dispiriting. Charming ‘self-restraint’ can edge into simple ‘coldness’. ‘Creativity’ can come to resemble ‘mania’. ‘Traditional values’ may appear like ‘narrow-minded provincialism.’ ‘Administrative competence’ starts, over a decade, to seem like ‘obsessive compulsive ordering.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The couple can fall victim to the phenomenon of polarisation, whereby the pro in a given area gets ever stronger and more resentful of the other’s weakness, and the amateur gets ever weaker and more humiliated by, and dismissive of, the other’s strength. The partner who is a pro loses any interest in teaching the other how to acquire their quality and, instead, merely gets irritated with their relative incompetence. Meanwhile, the amateur takes early retirement from the virtue in question, practises it less and looks at the pro with increasing suspicion and disdain.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Take the familiar problem of administrative competence. Imagine a couple where one person is stronger, the other weaker in this area. In the early days, one party much admired the other for being able to handle this side of things well. Yet over time, the tasks have somehow all gravitated in the direction of the competent one – generating conflict and resentment. The administrative pro believes they have to be on top of everything because the other seems ever more hopeless. At times they feel cursed that they have (by some fateful error) joined their life to a bureaucratic shirker. Whereas the amateur one (who had once felt this competence to be attractive) feels, with great disappointment, that their partner is becoming horribly rigid and authoritarian.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8862" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="8216597950_4867ae0a9a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<h6 class="p2"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or it could be that a couple has split painfully into ‘the creative one’ and ‘the practical one’. To the creative one, their partner is always finding the downside of any plan; they never speculate or daydream, they can’t take anything seriously if it doesn’t involve profit projections. Meanwhile the supposedly more practical comes to feel that their partner is often deluded, volatile and untrustworthy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Under pressure, these polarised positions become explosive: the instinctive response is to feel that one has somehow ended up with the wrong partner. Yet the truth is, we have this conflict precisely because we are with the right kind of person. It’s just we’re handling the differences in the wrong way. We’ve forgotten to teach one another the virtues we were, at the outset, attracted by – and admired for.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task of reducing the tension – and of lessening the damage each person is doing to the other – lies with the pro. They are in the position of strength (one is always the relative pro in some areas and the relative amateur in others). The pro needs to recognise that their hypercompetence in a given area, far from helping the situation, is in fact centrally responsible for creating it. It is unwittingly fostering and reinforcing the incompetence of the other.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The issue comes down to how best to teach. The pro implicitly believes that the best kind of teaching involves berating the student for their incompetence (for being ‘anal’ or ‘cold’ or ‘mad’ or ‘a social climber’ or a ‘mouse’). But of course, this only creates fear and withdrawal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you are teaching a child to do a maths problem, they won’t improve if one rushes in and gives the answer. And the more irate you become, the more confused and desperate they will feel. We know this in maths, and adopt different strategies. A key one is:<em> we pretend we don’t know. We hold back from showing our abilities</em>. We play at being a bit weaker than we are, to aid them to get stronger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4893867199_906a1984ef.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8860" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4893867199_906a1984ef.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="4893867199_906a1984ef" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But we tend not to adopt such a benign – and constructive – attitude in romantic life. We don’t see the partner as a ‘beginner’ in a legitimate subject area (like, perhaps, being punctual or cuddling), who needs carefully calibrated assistance. That’s because we are not in the habit of recognising that it really is an ability to process anxieties about an appointment to a degree where they don’t make us late, or to reduce our fears around intimacy enough to give someone a hug.</span></p>
<p class="p2">To change the dynamics of polarisation, the pro needs to back off from what comes a little too easily to them. They should see that their hypercompetence is actually discouraging the weaker party. They should – on purpose, for a time – get a bit worse in an area than they are: they should, out of kindness, play at becoming a bit shyer, messier, less creative… and thereby gently encourage the other person to take up the slack to restore the overall balance of a virtue within the relationship. They might have to tolerate things going a little wrong for a while in certain areas: the finances might get a bit muddled. They might miss a couple of parties. Dust could accumulate under the bed…</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2577593710_063558fe47_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8859" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2577593710_063558fe47_o.jpg?resize=635%2C563" alt="2577593710_063558fe47_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pro needs to understand that their own ability and ease in an area cannot be ordered. It has to be taught in the gentlest way. But they can feel reassured that the other party does deep down want to learn: that’s what the initial attraction was based on. One was attracted by difference and hoped to grow more complete. It’s just that no one ever learns when feeling humiliated.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">One of the ideals of modern relationships is that both parties will be ‘good communicators’. ‘Communication’ is held to lie at the heart of a thriving partnership.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what is ‘communication’? It isn’t – of course – merely talking. One wouldn’t count as a good communicator simply on the basis of being able to keep up a lively patter about the weather or serving up witty anecdotes about the local team.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/writingsand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4390" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/writingsand.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Man writes 'I LOVE U' in the sand for his sweetheart, 1920-60." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Good communication means the capacity to give another person an accurate picture of what is happening in your emotional and psychological life – and in particular, the capacity to describe its very darkest, trickiest and most awkward sides in such a way that others can understand, and even sympathise with them. The good communicator has the skill to take their beloved, in a timely, reassuring and gentle way, without melodrama or fury, into some of the trickiest areas of their personality and warn them of what is there (like a tour guide to a disaster zone), explaining what is problematic in such a way that the beloved will not be terrified, can come to understand, can be prepared and may perhaps forgive and accept.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But most of us are, of course, appalling communicators – and that is because there is so much inside of us that we can’t face up to, feel ashamed of or can’t quite understand – and we are therefore in no position to present our depths sanely to an observer, whose affections we want to maintain. Perhaps you have completely wasted the day on the internet. Or you are feeling sexually restless and drawn to someone else. Or you are in a vortex of envy for a colleague who seems to be getting everything right at work. Or you’re feeling overwhelmed by regret and self-hatred for some silly decisions you took last years (because you crave applause). Or maybe it’s a terror of the future that has rendered you mute: everything is going to go wrong. It’s over. You had one life – and you blew it. There are things inside of us that are simply so awful, and therefore so undigested, that we cannot – day to day – lay them out before our partners in a way that they can grasp them calmly and generously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1108" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hoody.jpg" alt="A young couple talk outside a hotel near" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet where we don’t ‘communicate’ a message, we still manage to get our points across, but just in toxic forms. As the expression goes, we ‘act out.’ Unable to pin down in a rational form what is ailing us, we may – for example – swear intemperately when someone asks us what is up. Or we go silent. Or we manically avoid subjects.</span></p>
<p class="p1">At the heart of the issue is the fact that we don’t only want our lovers to understand us. Certainly we want to be understood, but even more badly, we want to be loved – and when there appears to be an incompatibility, where we have no faith in our ability to get the tricky sides of us across, it is the truth that will be sacrificed – and yet will leak out in toxic symptoms nevertheless.</p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we find communication so difficult?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: No good role models</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learn to speak by hearing others speak. And in particular, we learn to speak about tricky topics because we hear others discussing them elegantly and kindly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tellingoff.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4391" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tellingoff.jpg?resize=635%2C459" alt="Naughty Boy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But most of us did not grow up around ‘good communicators’. Parental figures may have loved us, but they did not pull off the trick of describing the darkness within in timely, sane and reassuring ways. Instead, they acted out. They came home from work and shouted at us or the other parent because a colleague had humiliated them or they set the dishes down with a bang because they were feeling sexually neglected. A hugely damaging precedent was set.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Can you be ‘bad’ and yet still – overall – good?</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the ideal upbringing, those who loved us would be able to do so without demanding that everything about us be good. They could also tolerate that we could – sometimes, for a while – be violent, angry, mean and sexual – and yet still remain essentially acceptable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would give us a vital backdrop for our later confessions, an impression of fundamental acceptability. One could be, more or less, oneself and be confident that a loved one could – so long as things were explained properly – understand. We wouldn’t need to grow up into liars for love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fatherson.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4393" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fatherson.jpg?resize=635%2C485" alt="Father &amp; Son Talking, Son Is Leaning On Father." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This would be particularly true around sex, which is the most ‘shameful’ event to hit the life of any adolescent. Ideally, it would be possible to encounter unnerving aspects of one’s own erotic drives (the longing to do things which in any other context would seem dreadful; the longing to be – in bed – violent, disrespectful, crude…) without feeling that the whole of one’s nature would be deemed sordid and deranged.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But mostly we come from backgrounds which fall far short of this ideal. We feel that if we ever lose our tempers with our partners, we will be revealed as essentially brutish. Or if we confess to having some lazy sides, we will be condemned as layabouts. Or if we outline some slightly off-beat sexual tastes, we’ll descend into depravity and perversion. Or if we reveal our worries about work, we’ll set off a panic about our fundamental ineptitude. All this rather than feeling confident that we are basically, where it counts, essentially normal and decent people facing the typical run of chaotic and unruly desires and challenges endemic to every worthwhile human life.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Our tendency to get disgusted with ourselves – and therefore to assume that others will judge us harshly – is the central obstacle to communication. Shame robs us of the capacity to put our case sensibly and plausibly. It makes us long to conceal our failings; we feel the only way to protect ourselves and retain some quantum of dignity is to go silent. It’s not arrogance or the idea that one’s partner has no right to know. It is sheer terror that one’s self-loathing will be intensified to an unbearable degree by the presence of a witness.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: It will hurt you too much to hear this</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Neglectful parents aren’t, in this area, the sole problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s an even more dangerous possibility. The parent who loves fiercely, with enormous generosity, with depths of self-sacrifice – and whom one adores back. Except it seems they need one to be a certain way. They cannot be disappointed. They are fragile and it is one’s job to help keep them intact.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“If I tell you this bad but true thing, you will be deeply saddened and hurt. You won’t ever be able to take it.” A child might learn this way of thinking when confronted by a deeply loving and tender parent, who (whatever the truth) gives the impression that they could easily be hurt by witnessing part of your personality which doesn’t fit their preconceived ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piano.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4397" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/piano.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Family Photo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">If you told them that you loathed the cello, it would wound them terribly, for they specially arranged for you to have lessons, they were so proud of you; and they saved up to buy the instrument for many years. Or if you tell them you hate going to visit your grandparents on Saturdays, it might be experienced as an agonising betrayal from which they might never fully recover. Or if they knew what you get up to late at night under the sheets…</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This alerts us to the reciprocal nature of good communication. We must strive to tell the truth about ourselves honestly and kindly. But, from the other side of the equation, we must also strive to be the sort of people who can take the truth with grace, who don’t set the bar of acceptability so high that we leave others no chance but to tell us lies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: No one can understand me</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s no surprise if we sometimes think that communication will never work out. We have failed so often in the past. Our history is full of failed attempts. We’ve tried to tell our partner something and it hasn’t worked. So, we give up. Forever.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn-635x475.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4395" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/hepburn.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="Audrey Hepburn And Albert Finney In 'Two For The Road'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, to inject hope into the situation, this fear is governed by a false assumption: the idea that we can’t <em>learn</em> how better to communicate what is going on inside us. However, if we come to the view that it is in fact extremely challenging to communicate and that no one can be expected to do so automatically, then we may interpret past failures more generously.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact that it didn’t work out in the past isn’t decisive. We just need to learn to accept the darkness, to reduce fear, to present ourselves calmly, not to give way to self-loathing… We need to go to school in this area as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Communication in relationships sits within that huge neglected category of things that we need so badly to learn how to do, but which we have tended to assume we must know about instinctively from the start – to our and our lovers’ immense cost.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There are sweet moments – early on in relationships – when one person can’t quite work up the courage to let another know just how much they like them. They’d love to touch the other’s hand and find a place in their life; but their fear of rejection is so intense, they hesitate and falter. Our culture has a lot of sympathy for this awkward and intensely vulnerable stage of love.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/weekend2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4399" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/weekend2.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="Weekend - 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">We’re taught to be patient about the way people might get a bit odd when trying to express their needs early on. They might become somewhat flustered or tongue-tied. Or they might act sarcastically or coldly, not from indifference, but as a way to disguise a disturbingly powerful enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The assumption, however, is that the terror of rejection will be limited in scope, focused on one particular phase of a relationship: its beginning. Once a partner finally accepts us and the union gets underway, the assumption is that the fear must come to an end. It would be peculiar for anxieties to continue even after two people had made some thoroughly explicit commitments to one another, after they had secured a joint mortgage, bought a house together, made vows, had a few children and named each other in their wills.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sean.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4400" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sean.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="Sean Connery And Tippi Hedren In 'Marnie'" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">And yet one of the odder features of relationships is that in truth, the fear of rejection never ends. It continues, even in quite sane people, on a daily basis, and has some devastating consequences – chiefly because we refuse to pay it sufficient attention and aren’t trained to spot its counter-intuitive symptoms in others. We haven’t found a stigma-free, winning way to keep admitting just how much reassurance we need.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within our psyches, acceptance is never a given, reciprocity is never assured; there can always be new threats, real or perceived, to love’s integrity. The trigger to insecurity can be apparently miniscule. Perhaps the other has been away at work for unusual amounts of time; or they were pretty animated talking to a stranger at a party; or it’s been a while since sex took place. Perhaps they weren’t very warm to us when we walked into the kitchen. Or they’ve been rather silent for the last half an hour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/phone.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4401" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/phone.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="A suspicious woman observing her husband at the phone" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p2">Yet even after years with someone, there can be a hurdle of fear about asking for proof that we are wanted. But with a horrible, added complication: we now assume that any such anxiety couldn’t possibly exist.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This makes it very difficult to recognise our feelings, let alone communicate them to others in ways that would stand a chance of securing us the understanding and sympathy we crave. Rather than asking for reassurance endearingly and laying out our longing with charm, we might instead mask our needs beneath some brusque and plain hurtful behaviours guaranteed to frustrate our aims. Within established relationships, when the fear of rejection is denied, three major symptoms tend to show up:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: We get distant</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to get close to our partners but feel so anxious that we may be unwanted, we freeze them out instead. We say we’re busy, we pretend our thoughts are elsewhere, we imply that a need for reassurance would be the last thing on our minds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1144" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/alice.jpg" alt="'The L Word' TV Series, Season 6 - 2009" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We might even have an affair, the ultimate face-saving attempt to be distant – as a perverse attempt to assert that we don’t require the partner’s love (that we have been too reserved to ask for). Affairs can turn out to be the oddest of compliments; arduous proofs of indifference that we reserve for, and secretly address to, those we truly care about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: We get controlling</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We feel they are escaping us emotionally, and respond by trying to pin them down administratively. We get unduly cross that they are a bit late, we chastise them heavily for not having done certain chores, we ask them constantly if they’ve completed a task they had agreed to undertake. All this rather than admit: ‘I’m worried I don’t matter to you…’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1145" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/angry2.jpg" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can’t (we believe) force them to be generous and warm. We can’t force them to want us (even if we haven’t asked them to…). So we try to control them procedurally. The goal isn’t really to be in charge all the time, it’s just that we can’t admit to our terror about how much of ourselves we have surrendered. A tragic cycle then unfolds. We become shrill and unpleasant. To the other person, it feels like we can’t possibly love them anymore. Yet the truth is we do: we just fear rather too much that they don’t love us.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>Three: We get nasty</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a final recourse, we ward off our vulnerability by denigrating the person who eludes us. We pick up on their weaknesses and complain about shortcomings. Anything rather than ask the question which so much disturbs us: does this person love me? And yet, if this harsh, graceless behaviour could be truly understood for what it is, it would be revealed not as rejection, but as a strangely distorted – yet very real – plea for tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">* * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to all this trouble is to normalise a new, and more accurate picture of emotional functioning: to make it clear just how healthy and mature it is to be fragile and in repeated need of reassurance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1146" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ganges.jpg" alt="A couple smiles with their foreheads touching at night on the Ganges. Rishikesh, India." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">We suffer because adult life posits too robust a picture of how we operate. It tries to teach us to be implausibly independent and invulnerable. It suggests it might not be right to want a partner to show us they still really like us after they have been away for only a few hours. Or to want them to reassure us that they haven’t gone off us – just on the basis that they haven’t paid us much attention at a party and didn’t want to leave when we did.</p>
<p class="p2">And yet it is precisely this sort of reassurance that we constantly stand in need of. We can never be through with the requirement for acceptance. This isn’t a curse limited to the weak and the inadequate. Insecurity is, in this area, a sign of well-being. It means we haven’t allowed ourselves to take other people for granted. It means we remain realistic enough to see that things could genuinely turn out badly – and are invested enough to care.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should create room for regular moments, perhaps as often as every few hours, when we can feel unembarrassed and legitimate about asking for confirmation. ‘I really need you; do you still want me?’ should be the most normal of enquiries. We should uncouple the admission of need from any associations with the unfortunate and punitively macho term, ‘neediness’. We must get better at seeing the love and longing that lurk behind some of our and our partner’s most frosty, managerial and brutish moments.</span></p>
