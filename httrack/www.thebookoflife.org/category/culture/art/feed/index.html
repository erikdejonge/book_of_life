				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When there are grave disagreements about what’s good and bad in architecture…</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The-Shard-from-Parliament-Hill.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8016" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/The-Shard-from-Parliament-Hill.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="The-Shard-from-Parliament-Hill" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or art…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1280px-Ai_Weiwei_documenta_12.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8017" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1280px-Ai_Weiwei_documenta_12.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="1280px-Ai_Weiwei_documenta_12" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>there&#8217;s often someone around who very quickly closes the discussion down by saying:</p>
<p class="p1"><b>“Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder”</b></p>
<p class="p1">It’s a phrase with the power to silence. Once it’s been uttered, trying to keep up a dialogue about the merits or drawbacks of certain visual things can come across as shrill, anti-social or just plain rude.</p>
<p class="p1">This tendency to surrender to relativism is a paradoxical symptom of a scientific age. Science, the most prestigious force in modern society, deals in objective truths. The things it passes judgement on are obviously simply <i>not</i> in the eye of beholders. One can&#8217;t fairly say: ‘Well I don’t really feel that way about the boiling point of water or the nature of gravity.’ We have to be subservient to the facts science hands down to us.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet because notions of beauty and ugliness lie outside the system of scientific proof, it’s routinely assumed that they must then lie in a realm of total relativism &#8211; and that no progress whatsoever can be made towards arriving at better or worse answers about what looks good. The certainties of science have &#8211; unwittingly &#8211; made sensible debate in the humanities feel imperious and redundant.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ is in reality almost always unwarranted and deeply troublesome. It should, in our view, be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p class="p1">For a start, no one really believes in it to its core. We may well accept that there can be legitimate differences in taste within a reasonable spectrum; but we don&#8217;t actually think that <em>all</em> tastes are equal. If beauty simply lay in the eye of beholders, then it would presumably be sane to stand up and assert that a rubbish dump smelling of urine and decomposing fecal matter was a lovely place:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/17/1355749064055/landfill-rubbish-dump-uk-010.jpg?resize=620%2C372" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And that these modern canal side houses in Amsterdam were hideous:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/payload.cargocollective.com/1/4/137872/1838577/amsterdam%20architecture%20tour%20broneo2%20c%20kapungo.jpg?resize=615%2C450" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And it might then be logical to suggest that it would be OK to pull down the houses and replace them with a rubbish dump.</p>
<p class="p1">But of course, no one would want that &#8211; which shows that, in reality, we don’t actually believe that beauty does lie entirely in the eye of beholders. We have background aesthetic principles, even if we rarely articulate them &#8211; and are correspondingly very aware of moments when our tastes might clash with those of another.</p>
<p class="p1">When we use the phrase, what we seem to be trying to say is that there should be a lot of room for intelligent disagreement around aesthetics &#8211; and that we don’t feel comfortable about asserting the superiority of any one style or approach over any other. It implies an acute sensitivity to conflict and a fear of being rude or mean to others. However, by resorting to the phrase, what we actually do is unleash a stranger and more reckless situation: what we’re in effect stating is that nothing is ever really more beautiful &#8211; or uglier &#8211; than anything else.</p>
<p class="p1">This suggestion then has a way of implying that the whole subject is essentially trivial. After all, we’d never say that truths about the economy or justice were in the eyes of beholders only. We know that big things are at stake here &#8211; and over time, we&#8217;ve come to positions about the right and wrong way of approaching these topics, and are ready to discuss and defend our ideas. We wouldn&#8217;t ever say that &#8216;the treatment of the poor is just a subject best left entirely to the eyes of beholders&#8217; or &#8216;the best way to raise children is  in the eyes of beholders,&#8217; or &#8216;the future of the environment is in the eyes of beholders.&#8217; We accept that there are dangers to arguing in aggressive and unfruitful ways; but we are confident that there are sensible and polite ways to advance through these tricky yet vital debates. The same should feel true around beauty.</p>
<p class="p1">Partly, our reluctance to engage in aesthetic debate seems a symptom of a lack of confidence about our own tastes. Compare the way we behave over aesthetics to the way we behave around food and music, two fields where strong opinions and a love of arguing our case come naturally. Evaluating a new South-Asian restaurant on TripAdvisor, we&#8217;d be unlikely to say that &#8216;good restaurants just lie in the stomachs of eaters.&#8217; We&#8217;d have a point of view; we&#8217;d want to point out why place A was good, but place B was perhaps lacking in terms of its use of spices. We&#8217;d be opinionated, in interesting ways. Similarly, we would seldom say that music was in the ears of beholders, we&#8217;d have confidence in asserting that (say) Mozart had an edge over &#8216;The Wheels on the Bus go round and round&#8217; or London Grammar over the Verve. We&#8217;re not  here wanting to assert that one musician is better than another; we&#8217;re simply pointing to the legitimacy and interest of the debate and to the odd refusal even to start such a discussion in relation to architecture and art. Our neutral stance on aesthetics seems a symptom more of tentative taste than of any true commitment to relativism.</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, though calling for an end to discussion about beauty may seem a kindly, generous move, it is extremely convenient for property developers to operate in a society that has no confidence in people’s ability to make judgments about whether or not things are beautiful or monstrous. It means these cash-conscious types don’t have to worry about going to the expense of trying to make anything look good: because no one knows what that is anyway!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3798657_23229d73.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8022" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3798657_23229d73.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="3798657_23229d73" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ originally came to prominence as a shield to protect us against snobbery.</p>
<p class="p1">It asserted the rights of ordinary people to follow their enthusiasms at a time when high-handed experts held the cultural reins and tried to shape taste with stern and belittling authority. These experts told people what to like and treated dissent with disdain. The phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ was a defense against intolerance. It meant something like: ‘Stop trying to badger me into submission. My preferences are my personal call. I can think and feel as I like.’</p>
<p class="p1">But given that the freedom to think and feel as we like is now very well enshrined (indeed, perhaps too well enshrined), we don’t need to stay stuck at the early liberating move.</p>
<p class="p1">Our day-to-day problem isn’t that we’ll be bossed around by cultural snobs, it’s that the chances of attractive art and architecture taking hold will be lost, because of a culture obsessed by quick profits and a refusal to engage architects and artists in a dialogue about what they&#8217;re up to. Closing conversation down with ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ can make an already tricky situation far worse. A society that can’t talk sensibly, publicly and perhaps at length, about beauty will inadvertently condemn itself to ugliness.</p>

<p>A designed object is one whose makers worked long and hard to get it just right. Most of the world has sadly not been well-designed. But good design does matter. Far from being a luxury or an add-on, it is central to a good society. We feel like and are, in a sense, quite different people depending on what&#8217;s in front of our eyes.</p>

<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14545939465_eb39392947_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9732" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14545939465_eb39392947_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="14545939465_eb39392947_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There is widespread agreement that art is very important. But it can be remarkably hard to say quite why, or what it is <em>for</em>.</p>
<p>Here at The Book of Life (and its associated arm, The School of Life) we have a particular ideology about art. We believe that art is a tool which should help us to cope with a variety of cognitive frailties: it should help us to understand ourselves, empathise with others, guide us to morality, console us for our sorrows and function as an agent of hope.</p>
<p>The doctrine that art should be &#8216;for art&#8217;s sake&#8217; seems to us to be highly defeatist and pernicious. One is not doing art an injustice by ascribing a clear function to it. Far from it, one is saving it from irrelevance and the melancholy notion that it exists merely as a distraction or an ineffable and mysterious side-show to the main business of love and work. For most of human history, art was in the service of religions. We believe that where once art helped with the problems of theology, it should now assist us with the challenges of psychology.</p>
<p>To this end, we have created a microsite, an online museum, but with a difference. The site functions by taking a reading of your state of mind &#8211; and then matching you to an art-work, and a caption which will hopefully shift your consciousness in a useful direction.</p>
<p>Please take a look at our demonstration of a new ideology of art: <a href="http://www.artastherapy.com" target="_blank">artastherapy.com</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Whenever something looks interesting or beautiful, there’s a natural impulse to want to capture and preserve it – which means, in this day and age, that we’re likely to reach for our phones to take a picture.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1785" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2836998a.jpg" alt="Italy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this would seem to be an ideal solution, there are two big problems associated with taking pictures. Firstly, we’re likely to be so busy taking the pictures, we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. And secondly, because we feel the pictures are safely stored on our phones, we never get around to looking at them, so sure are we that we’ll get around to it one day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These problems would seem to be very much of today, a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But they were noticed right at the beginning of the history of photography, when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the English art critic, John Ruskin. He was a keen traveller who realised that most tourists make a dismal job of noticing or remembering the beautiful things they see. He argued that humans have an innate tendency to respond to beauty and desire to possess it, but that there are better and worse expressions of this desire. At worst, we get into buying souvenirs or taking photographs. But, in Ruskin’s eyes, there’s one thing we should do and that is attempt to draw the interesting things we see, irrespective of whether we happen to have any talent for doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/660px-Millais_Ruskin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4512" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/660px-Millais_Ruskin.jpg?resize=635%2C603" alt="660px-Millais_Ruskin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Ruskin, John Everett Millais, 1853-54</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Before the invention of photography, people used to draw far more than they do today. It was an active necessity. But in the mid-19th century, photography killed drawing. It became something only ‘artists’ would ever do, so Ruskin – passionate promoter of drawing and enemy of the camera – spent four years on a campaign to get people sketching again. He wrote books, gave speeches and funded art schools, but he saw no paradox in stressing that his campaign had nothing to do with getting people to draw well: ‘A man is born an artist as a hippopotamus is born a hippopotamus; and you can no more make yourself one than you can make yourself a giraffe.’</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So if drawing had value even when it was practised by people with no talent, it was for Ruskin because drawing can teach us to see: to notice properly rather than gaze absentmindedly. In the process of recreating with our own hand what lies before our eyes, we naturally move from a position of observing beauty in a loose way to one where we acquire a deep understanding of its parts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ruskintreestudy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4513" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ruskintreestudy.jpg?resize=632%2C478" alt="ruskintreestudy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Study of Part of the Trees in Turner’s ‘Crossing the Brook’, John Ruskin, before 1872</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ruskin was very distressed by how seldom people notice details. He deplored the blindness and haste of modern tourists, especially those who prided themselves on covering Europe in a week by train (a service first offered by Thomas Cook in 1862): ‘No changing of place at a hundred miles an hour will make us one whit stronger, happier, or wiser. There was always more in the world than men could see, walked they ever so slowly; they will see it no better for going fast. The really precious things are thought and sight, not pace. It does a bullet no good to go fast; and a man, if he be truly a man, no harm to go slow; for his glory is not at all in going, but in being.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So he slowed things down and recommended we spend far longer looking at impressive things, even quite simple things. His own drawings showed the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4516" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather1.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather, John Ruskin, 1875</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a measure of how accustomed we are to rushing that we would be thought unusual and perhaps dangerous if we stopped and stared at a place for as long as a sketcher would require to draw it. Ten minutes of acute concentration at least are needed to draw a tree; the prettiest tree rarely stops passers-by for longer than a minute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Summing up what he had attempted to do in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing, Ruskin wrote (in a beautiful passage it’s worth quoting in full):</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Let two persons go out for a walk; the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind. Let them go down a green lane. There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals. The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green, though he will think nothing about it; he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect; and that’s all! But what will the sketcher see? His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty, and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness. He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead, till the air is filled with the emerald light. He will see here and there a bough emerging from the veil of leaves, he will see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss and the variegated and fantastic lichens, white and blue, purple and red, all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty. Then come the cavernous trunks and the twisted roots that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes. Is not this worth seeing? Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane, and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it, but that you went down such and such a lane.’</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s one of the nicest aspects of Zen Buddhist art that, for hundreds of years, its most distinguished artists spent their time writing things down. They didn’t paint or draw, they just inscribed some very important things on outsize scrolls with exceptional artistry and beauty, so that these words might be hung on the wall and catch our eye at key moments in domestic and business life. The artists expressed things they felt we should all remember but that we too often forget, simple exhortations like: ‘Forgive those who insult you – for they are hurt rather than bad,’ ‘Before blaming, ask if they have eaten and slept well,’ ‘You are not as unusual, or as shameful, as you think.’</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2472" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wallhanging.jpg" alt="wallhanging" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a fascinating and neglected idea: making bits of philosophical wisdom into works of art in themselves. But this way of presenting words is sympathetic to a very basic human frailty. We forget key things. At the humblest level, the shopping list had to be invented because we have a tendency to overlook half the requirements of the larder when at the store. We likewise forget a great many pieces of emotional wisdom that are in our minds in theory, but that we overlook in practice. The wise, consoling, encouraging, or cautionary words are simply not there when we need them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By making words physically beautiful – through the elegance of the script and the soothing texture and proportions of the paper – a Zen scroll becomes a piece of decoration that helps wisdom become a part of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world isn’t short of wisdom: it’s short of inventive techniques for making the wisdom we do have more prominent, and more readily available to us at moments of crisis.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At a recent Sotheby’s auction in London, Wall by the German painter Gerhard Richter eclipsed the already vast estimate given by the auction house, finally selling for a shade under 17.5 million GBP. It confirms Richter’s place, in financial terms, at the very top of the the league of living artists. Generally, such news is transmitted with a degree of excitement and approval. It seems a sign of cultural health. Actually it shows we just don’t know what we want from art.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-sothebyA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4518" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-sothebyA.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="PM-190214-sothebyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not that there is anything wrong with the painting. It’s moving and tender. It’s a big square of red, through which streaks of blue and black and lilac tentatively emerge, as if a crucial message was straining to be heard. But not quite making it to the surface. At key moments in our lives, we might feel as if we, too, had something of deep importance to say – to a partner, a child or parent – and yet we didn’t. It was there in the atmosphere, but never got through. The painting gives dignity to our troubles and unfulfilled hopes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s an uncomfortable fact about all this: you can get the ‘message’ or, if you like, the benefit of this lovely work quite well by looking at a postcard or indeed, the reproduction on this website. The facsimile doesn’t of course quite have everything about the physical presence of the original. But it does convey almost everything, let’s say 96%, of what is important. That’s not a bad figure – given the price difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2812" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyB.jpg" alt="FRANCE SAINT LAURENT AUCTION" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Auction houses – just like the National Gallery, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art – are in the habit of insisting that, in order to derive the benefit of art, we have to go and see (and in some cases own) the original thing, the actual piece of canvas worked on by the actual hand of the great artist. It’s such an entrenched attitude, it’s got such prestige in our society, we hardly ever notice how strange and unhelpful it really is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to literature, we’re streets ahead – and by reflex, far wiser. We don’t feel that, in order to read<em> A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens, we have to head off to the Victoria and Albert Museum every time to go through the original manuscript. We’re rightly sure that we can get everything that matters from a free e-book or a paperback (£4.99).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2814" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyC.jpg" alt="PM-190214-sothebyC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference is: we know what novels are for. We’re far far more confident around books. We’ve been handling them since childhood. We know the deal: you get to meet the characters, hear their stories, enter their imaginary world. They help with perspective, self-knowledge, consolation and inspiration. We might not often say it, but we get a direct therapeutic benefit from reading them. And we understand instinctively that this can happen not in an archive, but on the train or, even better, tucked up in bed or at the beach.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2813" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyD.jpg" alt="PM-190214-sothebyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t need to go there</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should become equally confident about art; it would be so much wiser, cheaper and easier. Works of art aren’t endlessly mysterious things to which we invariably have to go and pay a physical homage. The national museums want us to, and one can see why – but we don’t always have to follow their call. We’ve been doing so long enough. Works of art are tools that can help our lives to go a little better. They influence our moods, remind us of important truths that are constantly slipping from our minds and – like Richter’s Wall – lend dignity to our sufferings. These are very valuable things. But nobody needs to pay millions, or take a day off and make a trip to an art gallery, just to get hold of them. The postcard is enough. 96% of the value of the Richter painting is available if you just scroll it up and take a look at it for two concentrated minutes. That’s a big saving. No wonder Sotheby’s, the National Galleries and anyone in their pay would be deeply unhappy to read this.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Fake, copy, pastiche, forgery, reproduction. Many of the most bitter insults of the art world are designed to denigrate anything which is not the actual product of the master’s hand.</p>
<p class="p1">People will make a special trip to Milan and stand in long queues to see the original <em>Last Supper</em> painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself. If that work was ever to come up for sale – which in itself would be considered an outrage – the sums involved would be utterly gigantic.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2633" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SB_07_China_Dafen-00550-1.jpg" alt="China's Art Copy Center" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Just as useful as the original</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reproduction from a factory in the outskirts of Shenzhen, China, can be had for the price of a swanky new toaster. Its status is correspondingly very low indeed. If you had the original in your house, the most glamorous people in the world would want to be your friends. But if you display the copy, art world insiders will smirk and regard you as cultural low-life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve uncritically absorbed the idea that copies are worthless, deeply embarrassing kitsch. The nightmares of curators and gallery directors are haunted by copies. Hang a reproduction by mistake and your career is over.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But why? Why are copies always supposed to be so terrible? Even asking this straightforward question is suspect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, of course, a copy is truly terrible. It mucks up all the details, it gets proportions weirdly wrong, the colours become garish. But not always.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2634" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/van-gogh-3d-relievos-copy-korenvelden1.jpg" alt="van-gogh-3d-relievos-copy-korenvelden1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultra high quality reproductions of <em>Wheatfield under Thunderclouds</em>, based on the original in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. You couldn’t possibly tell it apart from the original, unless you used a microscope.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What if it’s a really good copy? What if the details are faithful? What if the proportions are harmonious and the colours lovely? A well-made reproduction carries 99% of the meaning of the original. And maybe that’s all that really matters to us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A postcard transmits a great deal of the original too. And if we’re honest we have to admit that quite often it’s the postcard that moves us later, while we didn’t feel or think anything very much when we stood gingerly in front of the original in the gallery, jostling for elbow room.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A huge fan of copies, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe – a central character of Western civilisation – had big reproductions of his favourite paintings in his dining room</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying can be good. We should be proud to display copies in our homes and public galleries. We should stop being so unreasonably obsessed with whether something is the original prototype. Our culture has spent a lot of time thinking about what can go wrong around copies. But the potential benefits and advantages of copying works of art have not been recognised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2636" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nocturne-blue-and-silver-chelsea-1.jpgLarge.jpg" alt="nocturne-blue-and-silver-chelsea-1.jpgLarge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Helpful – but it’s in Tate Britain, not in your kitchen at 11.30pm</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to think that art belongs in art galleries and thereby condemned ourselves to encountering works at times dictated by museum opening hours and holiday schedules. We hardly ever get enraged in Tate Britain. So we’re unlikely ever to have direct need of Whistler’s immensely calming vista of fog, water and evening lights when we actually see it in the gallery. So it would be very much better if we could hang a copy of this work in the kitchen or by the bathroom door – places where angst has a tendency to congeal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art works have therapeutic power. But usually this passes us by. Not because we are insensitive or unworthy. But for a more basic reason. Their messages are hitting us at the wrong time – at moments when we’ve no need of them – like adverts for winter coats on the first day of spring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying is the much-needed solution to this problem, because copies allow us to locate these important, beneficial images in the places where we can encounter them in our times of need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2638" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Nithsdale_Road_Tenements_Glasgow.jpg" alt="640px-Nithsdale_Road_Tenements_Glasgow" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sadly it’s unique. There should be thousands just like it</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The art world tends to stress rarity and uniqueness as very desirable. It’s an understandable attitude (money and jobs depend on it). But it’s also really unfortunate for the rest of us. Because ideally the best things would be in plentiful supply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to praise the Strathbungo Tenements in Glasgow as a unique, dignified and noble way of grouping one and two bedroom flats together in a single building. But actually it’s a terrible pity that there’s just one building like this. The city would have been very well served if this had been widely copied. If it had become normal, rather than unusual, for communal buildings to look this good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying the masterpieces increases the supply of good things; it brings down the price; it makes them more widely available. Rarity yields status for the very few, but is has nothing to offer a society as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2639" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Villa_Rotonda_side1.jpg" alt="640px-Villa_Rotonda_side" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Villa Rotonda: When you copy, you can chop and change as well</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrea Palladio is one of the greats of Italian architecture. He was also great at copying. He didn’t invent the front of his best house, the Villa Rotonda. He just reproduced an existing model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/MaisonCarr%C3%A9e.jpeg" alt="" width="517" height="388" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Copy the front but make the back nicer, and change the colour too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he didn’t merely copy. He helped his clients customise. They really liked the columns at the front of ancient, and much revered, Roman temples. But the rest was a bit inconvenient. They weren’t daunted. They weren’t too pious. They felt free – guided by Palladio – to chop and change. It’s the basic lesson of the Renaissance. Copy what you really admire and adapt the rest to suit your needs. Make it comfortable. Yet when the same argument is run about paintings, the art world gets hysterical. It’s one of the things that bothers sophisticated people about the Chinese painting factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine you like the Mona Lisa, but the background doesn’t work for you. So, change the colour of the mountains. It sounds terrible to some people. But in principle it is like Palladio’s attitudes to Roman temples: I like the front, but don’t much care for the sides…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shakespeare had a similar attitude to traditional stories. He thought nothing of changing a bit here and there so the narrative would work better for a modern audience. This is the classical attitude to culture. It’s yours to refine, adapt and improve. Because you want and need a lot from it, it’s not just about preserving the past, it’s about adapting things for the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2641" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SB_07_China_Dafen-00038-e1395185545298.jpg" alt="SB_07_China_Dafen-00038-e1395185545298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">We get negative about copying in part because we’re not so sure what we really want from art. But in fact the point of art is to help us live our lives more wisely and with greater poise. Once we recognise that art has a purpose – a great and useful purpose – we can get less bothered about the difference between the original and a copy. Because, thankfully, a copy might do just as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve been around an art exhibition of a favourite artist. Perhaps it was Barbara Hepworth, the mid-20th-century British sculptor, recently accorded a show by the Tate Gallery in London. On display were some of her greatest works, including ‘Two Figures’ and ‘Pelagos.’</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9262" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image01.png?resize=500%2C640" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9263" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00.png?resize=635%2C546" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show has made you intensely receptive to what one might call the vision of life promoted by Hepworth. It’s a confused feeling, but now that the show is over (you were there for forty minutes) you’d like to take that spirit back out into the world, you’d like to Hepworth-ify important parts of your daily existence. Hepworth seems to you an exemplar of a dignified British modernism that celebrates intellectual rigour, restrained sensuality, elegance, simplicity and harnessed emotional intensity. You want your surroundings and the tenor of your days to take on some of Hepworth’s ideology: you would love your workplace, your railway station, your TV programmes and your relationships to be influenced by her atmosphere (and strangely, it feels normal that the spirit of an artist might spread way beyond particular artworks and be applicable to fields as diverse as architecture and relationships).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s in this mood and with these covert aspirations that you find your way to the gift shop. It’s an extremely busy place. Almost everyone who goes to the show spends a few minutes looking around and the line at the till snakes out to the door. You’re excited and ready to spend. This &#8211; surely &#8211; is the opportunity to Hepworthify your life. So you look around the aisles: there are scholarly monographs (tracing Hepworth’s relationship with the St Ives School and with Henry Moore’s early etchings), there is a large catalogue, there are some postcards, there is a tea towel and there are pencils and mugs with Hepworth’s name on it. The latter seem the most popular items of all.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9264" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to be receptive to what is on offer but the gift shop seems not to welcome your aspirations. If only there had been other things for sale… Perhaps reproductions of the actual works or guides on how to Hepworth-ify your life… Your desires are rather unclear. All you know is that the gift shop has not lived up to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important and no way isolated dilemma. The gift shop is quite simply the most important tool for the diffusion and understanding of art in the modern world. Though it appears to be a mere appendage to most museums, the gift shop is central to the project of art institutions. Its job is to ensure that the lessons of the museum &#8211; which concern beauty, meaning and the enlargement of the spirit &#8211; can endure in the visitor far beyond the actual tour of the premises and be put into use in daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The means deployed, however, are rarely on target. Aside from books, gallery gift shops usually sell postcards and household items with the names of artists on them. Postcards are such important mechanisms because they improve our engagement with art. Officially, our culture sees them as tiny, pale shadows of the far superior originals in the galleries a few metres away. But the encounter we have with the postcard may well be deeper, more perceptive and more valuable to us, because the card allows us to bring our own reactions to it. It feels safe and acceptable to pin it on a wall, throw it away or scribble on the front of it and by being able to behave so casually around it, our responses come alive. We consult our own needs and interests; we take real ownership of the object and because it is permanently available, we keep looking at it at various times. We feel free to be ourselves around it &#8211; as so often, and sadly, we do not in the presence of the masterpiece itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, gift shops will rarely sell us actual reproductions of works; fake, copy, pastiche, forgery. Many of the most bitter insults of the art world are designed to denigrate anything which is not the actual product of the master’s hand. We’ve uncritically absorbed the idea that copies are worthless, deeply embarrassing kitsch. The nightmares of curators and gallery directors are haunted by copies. Hang a reproduction by mistake and your career is over. But why? Why are copies always supposed to be terrible? Even asking this straightforward question is suspect. Sometimes, of course, a copy truly violates the original. It mucks up all the details, it gets proportions weirdly wrong, the colours become garish. But not always. What if it’s a really good copy? What if the details are faithful? What if the shapes are harmonious and the colours lovely? A well-made reproduction can carry 99% of the meaning of the original. And maybe that’s all that really matters to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve come to think that art belongs in art galleries and thereby condemned ourselves to encountering works at times dictated by museum opening hours and holiday schedules. We hardly ever get enraged in Tate Britain. So we’re unlikely ever to have direct need of Whistler’s immensely calming vista of fog, water and evening lights when we actually see it in the gallery. So it would be very much better if we could hang a copy of this work in the kitchen or by the bathroom door – places where angst has a tendency to congeal.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image021.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9265" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image021.png?resize=550%2C658" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art works have therapeutic power. But usually this passes us by. Not because we are insensitive or unworthy. But for a more basic reason. Their messages are hitting us at the wrong time – at moments when we’ve no need of them – like adverts for winter coats on the first day of spring. Copying is one much-needed solution to this problem, because copies allow us to locate these important, beneficial images in the places where we can encounter them in our times of need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of copies, gift shops will sell us a lot of signed tea towels. They have discovered that people will buy objects heavily decorated with names of artists and their works: so we have Picasso table mats and Hepworth pencils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such objects try hard to pay homage to artists. They would like to beautify the world and carry the message of artists deep into our homes, so that the spirit of Hepworth would be alive when we prepared the morning tea and Picasso would be with us as we mopped away the orange juice from the kitchen counter. The ambition is noble, but its method of execution perhaps less so. The gift shop objects do have a faint link to the names they honour. Monet probably liked tea-towels; but it is unlikely that he would have wanted one with his own painting printed on it. The spirit of his best works of art, the things we love in them, may be much more consistent with (for instance) a completely plain and beautifully textured towel. This is more truly a Monet towel than one with his name on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point isn’t to surround ourselves with objects which carry the actual identity of the artist and his or her work. It should be to get hold of objects which the artists would have liked, which are in keeping with the spirit of their works &#8211; and more broadly to look at the world through their eyes, and therefore to stay sensitive to what they saw in it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9272" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k1.jpg?resize=635%2C654" alt="15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can imagine a different range of products to sell in the world’s gallery gift shops: objects which would be aligned with the values and ideals of artists rather than with their mere identities. The urge to buy something at the end of a museum visit is a serious one, because it involves an attempt to translate a sensibility we’ve come to know in one area (in carved wood or on canvases showing landscapes) and carry it over into another part of life (keeping the kitchen clean).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This points to the heart of what museums should really be about: giving us tools to extend the range and impact of what we admire in works of art across our whole lives. This is why the gift shop is, in fact, the most important place in the museum &#8211; if only its true potential could be grasped and made real.</span></p>
