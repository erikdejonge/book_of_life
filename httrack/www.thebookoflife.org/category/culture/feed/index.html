				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pop music started in a big way in the 1960s, it seemed at times like an especially silly medium, favoured by hormonal school girls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and connected up with delinquent and tediously bizarre behaviour. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2014/05/1964-beatlemania/b37_40818023/main_900.jpg?resize=721%2C571" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, philosophy had a reputation for being deeply serious and impressive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the natural home of the big ambition to understand ourselves and transform the world through ideas.</span></p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/canada/2012/05/22/mounties_kept_eye_on_jeanpaul_sartre_documents_show/sartre_inoffice.jpeg?resize=721%2C542" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the 1960s, philosophy has stalled and pop has conquered the world. It is now the foremost medium for the articulation of ideas on a mass scale. This explains why, if it is to survive, philosophy must study pop; part of its salvation lies in understanding pop’s techniques so as to be able to become, in crucial ways, a little more like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a host of critical lessons philosophy can learn from pop. For a start, pop teaches us about charm. The great pop songs are bewitchingly, dazzlingly charming in the manner in which they get their messages across: they know exactly how to wear away our defences and enter our imaginations with easy grace. It’s a reminder that it isn’t enough for ideas to be correct. For them to become powerful and deliver on their promises, they need to know how to win over an audience. Pop is the most seductive force the world has ever known; it has more &#8211; and more devoted &#8211; adherents than all religions put together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is more deeply loved, more trusted, and a more constant companion in our joys and sorrows than any other art form.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10111" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop has become powerful in part because it has cleverly understood the division of labour. Those who can sing and hold the crowd may not be the same as those who know how to write music or arrange instruments. Pop is unashamed about uniting talent wherever it finds it, so that the final result can combine the most beautiful face with the finest voice, the best score and the most beguiling instrumental arrangement. Pop has overcome the Romantic hangup about the unique creator, it knows that the most intimate, heartfelt result may be the outcome of large-scale institutional collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop teaches us too about compression. It knows our lives are busy and has an extraordinarily ambitious sense of what could be achieved in under three minutes. Like all other art forms, pop is trying to communicate ideas, but it bypasses the more resistant intellectual parts of the mind. All the usual obstacles to reaching another person are stripped away in the name of visceral intimacy. Pop achieves what Pericles, Lincoln, Dickens and Proust were attempting &#8211; and spectacularly exceeds all of them. It provides the ultimate demonstration of the 19th-century theorist Walter Pater’s tantalising assertion that ‘All art aspires to the condition of music.’</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10100" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like religion, pop knows that repetition is key. It works its effect through being heard again and again. It would prefer to grab three minutes from you every day, than three hours every two months. Like religious incantation, it is interested in working upon our souls cumulatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop is intelligent in not being afraid of simplicity; it is too wise to be held back by pedantry or erudition. It knows that our emotional needs are in essence obvious: to be encouraged, to be held, to be jollied, to be reassured when we are alone, to be told something beautiful and uplifting. It doesn’t suffer from high art’s perverse addiction to subtlety. It accepts that the core of our minds may be astonishingly basic in its structure.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10108" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hqdefault.jpg?resize=550%2C413" alt="hqdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop is ultimately the master of collective euphoria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It possesses what churches and politicians would like, but are so rarely able to secure. It has worked out how to generate shared moments of deep emotion about important things. In the stadium, the singer functions as a high priest, for whom the flock might be ready to make major sacrifices; they would, in their benign frenzy, be willing to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That philosophy needs to learn from pop doesn’t preclude that pop needs &#8211; of course &#8211; to learn quite a bit from philosophy as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop currently touches on the big themes but doesn’t, as yet, properly take up many of the opportunities that lie its way. It is lacking in ultimate ambitions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6966830273_1817c106c2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10113" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6966830273_1817c106c2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6966830273_1817c106c2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, we need pop musicians to take up the challenge of investigating the deepest truths, of getting behind transformative concepts and of making these into the things we’ll sing about in front of the bathroom mirror with our hairbrushes &#8211; so that they become the background sounds of our inner lives. The world waits for a redemptive synthesis between philosophy and pop.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/schooloflife1.jpg?resize=299%2C448" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Life, which is responsible for this website, is a global organisation with a simple mission in mind. We want to increase the amount of WISDOM in circulation. We are fighting for:</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Relationships</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Work</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Leisure</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Culture</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Selves</p>
<p>To increase Wisdom, we undertake a number of activities; run shops and classrooms, consult to businesses, write books, make films &#8211; and a diversity of other projects. Behind our activities lies a common way of looking at the world: a set of beliefs about the central challenges facing us and how our lives might be improved. Our thinking breaks down as follows:</p>
<p>1.<em><strong> Relationships</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree with the view (first put forward by Freud) that a fulfilled life is essentially made up of two ingredients: Love and Work. But we’re also aware that disappointment, frustration and a sense of failure are very often the norm in these arenas; which both saddens us and spurs our efforts.</span></p>
<p>In our thinking about love, we’re much indebted to psychoanalysis, which tells us that our childhoods mark us deeply and frequently leave us a legacy of trouble around relating to others. We can have difficulties trusting or being close, achieving the right distance or staying resilient. We are prone to ‘transfer’ a lot of emotions from our past on to present day scenarios where they don’t quite belong, and may thereby respond unfairly to partners without quite understanding what is driving us. We may (in the invaluable vocabulary of the English psychoanalyst John Bowlby) be either ‘avoidant’ or ‘anxious’ in how we behave with others.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/ywcacassclay.areavoices.com/files/2012/10/161_MotherBabySMALL.jpg?resize=442%2C502" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only hope of escape from these patterns is to become a little more aware of them. In our search to understand love, we are great believers in the benefits of self-knowledge and, most importantly, of that royal route to this knowledge: psychotherapy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current relationship difficulties also stem from a cultural source &#8211; which we call ‘Romanticism’. We’ve collectively given ourselves a deeply problematic Romantic picture of what good relationships should be like: we dream of profound intimacy, satisfying sex, an absence of secrets and only a modicum of conflict. This faith in love is touching, but it carries with it a tragic flaw: having high expectations can turn out to be an enemy of workable mature relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8609" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Chatterton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are instead drawn to what we’ve called a Classical approach. The Classical view is cautious about love. Classical people pay special attention to what can go wrong around others. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the standard of partners across society and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances. This view of people is fundamentally, but usefully, dark. Everyone is ultimately deeply troubled and hard to live with. The only people whom one can think of as normal are those one doesn’t yet know very well. </span></p>
<p>A Classical philosophy holds that because we are not naturally well equipped for the demands of relationships, we need a lot of assistance and education. We need a culture that helps us to understand ourselves and to form realistic expectations. We require regular reminders to be more patient, forgiving, understanding and appreciative.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8611" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Man writes 'I LOVE U' in the sand for his sweetheart, 1920-60." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The starting point has to be a frank recognition of our natural frailties: we have to accept that we have terrible tendencies to misinterpret people and situations and regularly fail at the challenges of getting close to others. We believe that love is a skill that has to be learnt, not an impulse that can just be followed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our quest to help relationships go better, we write books, make films, run classes and offer psychotherapy.</span></i></p>
<p>2. <em><strong>Sexuality </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also aware of the scale of the hopes and challenges around sex. Though we often believe ourselves to be living in a liberated age, it remains acutely difficult not to feel shame around many of our sexual impulses. It is especially tricky to communicate what we want to those we are drawn to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, technology has made pornography a constant feature of modern love &#8211; and a challenge to our desire to integrate our sexuality with other things we might care about, like tenderness, intelligence and dignity.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8613" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg?resize=587%2C477" alt="PM-040314-pornB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in removing some of the shame around sex by revealing that many so-called perversions and fetishes are just complex quests for intimacy. We believe in adopting a tragic view of sex, in which we can see that not all our desires can ever be fulfilled. Strategic pessimism has a role to play in managing the demands of the libido.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our work on sexuality, we write books, make films, run classes &#8211; and run a pornography site at </span></i><a href="http://www.pornastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.pornastherapy.com</span></i></a></p>
<p>3.<strong><em> Work</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the distinctive ideas of modern times is that we don’t expect work to be simply a drudgery that we have to undertake to survive. We have high expectations of this huge part of our lives. Ideally, we want work to be ‘meaningful’, which involves the belief that we are in some way either reducing the pain, or increasing the happiness of other humans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seem to be three things that imbue work with meaning. Firstly, a meaningful job taps into the deepest, most sincere and talented parts of us. So different people will necessarily find different sorts of work meaningful, according to what is inside their deepest self: for some meaning might emerge from baking bread, others will feel their deep self engaged by computer science, for others still, they will feel mostly full themselves, most fully alive, when investing money or teaching kids a foreign language.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8617" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="16371178501_34359cb448_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, a meaningful job is one which to some extent helps others: which fixes a problem that humans have: a job which in ways large and small, serves humanity. Meaningful work provides a service to others. And thirdly, a job feels meaningful when the person doing it can viscerally sense, day to day, the impact of their work upon an audience. In other words, not only is the job theoretically meaningful, it actually feels meaningful as one does it in the course of an average day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should it be so hard to find meaningful work? Why are we in such danger of doing work that brings in money but doesn’t fulfill the meaning side of us? Three big reasons stand out: firstly, because it&#8217;s perilously hard for us to locate our true interests in the time we have before simply paying the bills becomes an imperative. Our interests don’t manifest themselves spontaneously, they require us to patiently analyse ourselves and try out a range of options, to see what feels as if it might have the best ‘fit’ for us. But unfortunately, schools and universities, as well as society at large, doesn’t place much emphasis on this stage of education; on helping people to understand their authentic working identities. There’s far more stress on simply getting ready for any job, than a job that would be particularly well suited to us. Which is a pity not just for individuals, but for the economy as a whole because people always work better, harder and more fruitfully when their deep selves are engaged.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8621" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg?resize=635%2C383" alt="FOX 2013 Summer TCA Tour - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, many jobs are relatively meaningless because it’s very possible, in the current economy, to generate profits from selling people things that aren’t really helping them in any way, but hoodwink them or prey on their lack of self-command. Most of us have a dangerously loose hold on what really brings us satisfaction long-term: which gives room for entrepreneurs to build huge and profitable businesses selling stuff which no one is particular proud of at the end of an average day. Those who work in these businesses know in their hearts that they haven’t really helped anyone have a better life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, a job may have real meaning, may genuinely be helping others, but it may not feel like this day to day because many organisations are so large, so slow moving, so split up over so many continents that the purpose of everyone’s work day to day gets lost amidst meetings, memos, conference calls and administration.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8623" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="5380585665_72842b37ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This diagnosis helps to point the way to what we might begin to do to make work more meaningful for people: firstly, pay a lot more attention to helping people find their vocation, their real working authentic self; through moves like career psychotherapy, extended work placements and changes to school and university curricula so as to allow students to start to analyse their identities and aptitudes from a much younger age. Secondly, the more we, as customers, can support businesses engaged in meaningful work, the more meaningful jobs there will be. Consumers have an enormous power over what kind of lives we can have as producers. By raising the quality of our demand, we raise the number of jobs there are which can answer to mankind’s deeper needs. Thirdly, in businesses which do carry out meaningful work, but on too large a scale over too long a period for it to feel meaningful day to day, we need to get better at telling stories of what the business is up to. We need to give work some of the intimacy of a small business, even if it’s a giant multinational; lending to those who work there a tangible sense of their contribution to the whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that work is meaningful is no luxury: it determines the greatest issue of all in modern economics and politics: how hard and well people will work &#8211; and therefore how successful and wealthy our societies can be.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We run a Business unit that works with companies to create more meaningful products and services; we also run a learning and development department which resolves many interpersonal issues in workplaces and we offer psychotherapy and life coaching which helps people discover their vocation and unpick conflicts around careers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<strong><strong><em> Education </em><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>Our ability to learn is one of the most basic things about the human condition. The range of things that we can learn to do better, via instruction, is very wide. However, the powerful influence of Romantic thinkers, who were convinced that important psychological things could not be taught, means the current education system leaves us stranded with all sorts of issues which are not passed down across generations, because they are believed to lie in the realm of intuition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take the more Classical view that all important human achievements can be taught: how to design a city; how to have a conversation, how to be a loving parent, how to be calmer or more creative&#8230;  We currently receive no instruction around self-knowledge (how to keep calm, for example, or learn to forgive). Such things are not seen as being at the core of education and even as things than can’t be learned. We passionately disagree.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8626" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Businessmen At Conference Table" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re aware of how easily people are turned off by anything that appears too preachy and by the fatal tendency for what is worthy to come across as dull. Our commitment to education makes us very interested in seduction and charm: that is, in the arts of getting and holding people&#8217;s attention in a highly individualistic world filled with distractions and demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because education is so central, we are ambitious about all the things that can educate us. Education isn’t just what goes on in schools: the arts and the media have hugely educative roles &#8211; but our culture has tended to shy away from acknowledging them.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://pierjacobsen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/daily-mail.png" alt="" width="404" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should not only be children who go to school. Adults in general should see themselves as in need of education. One should never be done with school. One should stay an active alumni, learning throughout life. In the adult section of schools, there should be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. There should be career advice for the middle-aged. Schools should be where a community gets educated, not just a place for children. So children should feel that they are participating in the early stages of a life-long process. Some classes should have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia the phrase ‘I’ve finished school’ would sound extremely strange.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life runs physical branches around the world where you can drop in for classes on almost any topic in the arena of emotional well-being. We also diffuse our lessons through films and books. We are interested in redesigning curricula; the programme of what to know to be ‘educated’.</span></i></p>
<p>5. <strong><em>Religion</em></strong></p>
<p>We’ve got a particular take on religion. We are clearly in a post-religious age but that doesn’t make us indifferent or hostile to religious thinkers. In fact the opposite is true: we are very keen on learning from religious thinkers. The technical errors of religions (for example, the claim that the soul can be reincarnated, that Christ rose from the dead or that the creator of the cosmos made specific promises about land rights at the eastern end of the Mediterranean) historically got entwined with some highly important, enduring large scale social and psychological ambitions. Religions have been machines for addressing psychological needs, which we still have.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8630" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="216342260_d4b816f8c1_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Religions at their best tried to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep ideas about forgiveness at the front of our minds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged compassion for the weak </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisted that worldly success was a fatally misleading way of assessing the worth of people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">got us to recognise our own capacities to hurt others and to feel sorry for doing so</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nudged us to be tender and understanding towards the secret sufferings of others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave us helpful rituals to keep important ideas before us throughout the year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see the School of Life as picking up many of the tasks of religion and creating secular replacements for particular religious ideals and practices (monasteries, weddings, funerals etc.). In agreement with the great thinkers of the 19th century, we believe that culture should replace scripture.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>6. <em>Culture</em></strong></strong></p>
<p>At the moment, culture (literature, art, film, photography, theatre) isn’t properly focused on taking up the crucial topics that religion formerly led the way on. People who want to express admiration for culture often say it’s valuable ‘for its own sake’. We can’t agree: it is valuable because it is capable of addressing our needs for education, guidance, consolation, perspective, encouragement and correction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are drawn to the idea that culture is therapeutic. The idea of a ‘therapeutic’ culture isn’t that it should help us primarily with very urgent and severe mental health issues. It’s the idea that it can assist us to get better at managing the normal troubles of everyday life; like the tendency to get unhelpfully irritated with people we like, to lose perspective over minor matters, to lose sympathy with people who deserve our compassion and to take too harsh a view of our own mistakes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8634" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="NETHERLANDS-ART-RIJKS-MUSEUM-VERMEER-RFEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the various branches of culture having a therapeutic function isn’t new &#8211; it’s an idea started by Aristotle and endorsed by, among many others, Hegel and Nietzsche. We can here highlight some of the key therapeutic powers of conspicuous areas of cultural life:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps us around inescapable failures and follies. The normal instinct is to be very annoyed with ourselves and others when we mess up. Unfortunately, this instinct often doesn’t serve us very well. Comedy, at its best, makes the therapeutic move of showing the fool as loveable. We don’t laugh at the fool out of derision, but out of unexpected sympathy.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8636" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="jan-6-david-brent-dance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">History</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teaches us to deal more effectively with the problems that face us today. It introduces us to ideas that were in circulation in the past but which are needed now. History is a corrective to the myopia of the news industry.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painting and the visual arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help us by being (in Hegel’s terminology) ‘the sensuous embodiment of ideas’. Often even very good ideas need to be experienced in a sensory way before they become meaningful to us. This power is revealed when a skilled piece of photography on the news makes us suddenly feel personally very touched by a geographically distant event which had previously left us cold. The role of the visual arts is to build up the images that we ought to have playing often in our minds at the difficult moments of our lives.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8638" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Cardinal Marc Ouellet presides over the" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the role of music is to support beneficial emotions and states of mind. Many states that are very important to us (calm, patience, modesty without being crushed, hopefulness, forgiveness) also tend to be fleeting and elusive. We need them, but on our own, we struggle to hold onto them. Music is a therapeutic cultural mechanism for deliberately and strategically making certain states of mind more reliably available.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an astonishing ability to take us inside the experience of other people. So we can, even if only briefly, experience the world through the eyes of those who once seemed foreign and threatening, a move we find so hard in our daily lives. Novels lend us more lives than we have properly been granted.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8641" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PRIDE AND PREJUDICE - 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architecture </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates environments that have characteristics comparable to human ones. We need buildings and cities that encourage our own better natures &#8211; by presenting in a lasting and very large-scale way the characteristics we ourselves have at our best. Ideally, buildings give long-term and public encouragement to the social virtues of harmony, modesty and dignity.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of communication: it promotes identity. What we wear tells other people (and ourselves) something about who we are. Fashion tends to strike serious people as vain and silly because the messages that clothes happen to send are often not very helpful or admirable. But they sometimes are and could be much more.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.fashiongonerogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MargetHowellSS1.jpg?resize=483%2C633" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that the world has, up to now, not properly made use of the huge therapeutic potential of culture. We pay reverence to culture: but we have not yet learnt how to use it systematically.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life has curated a number of museum shows which put our theories on public display. We run websites at </span></i><a href="http://www.artastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.artastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="http://www.booksastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.booksastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="http://www.foodastherapy.org"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.foodastherapy.org</span></i></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have built a secular monastery in mid-Wales with the architect John Pawson.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>7. <em>Politics </em></strong></strong></p>
<p>We believe that paternalism has an important role to play in good societies. We know how scary that can sound and how strong libertarian voices can be. Libertarianism is an exaggerated stance with roots in all our psyches and says that no one else can know what is right for another person, most of all a government. Freedom and choice are everything. No one should be telling us &#8216;what to do&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, we believe that a good paternalistic government won’t ever be imposing an alien agenda. A sound democratic government is able to remind voters that a certain piece of legislation is what they themselves would ask for in their calmer, more reasonable, more tender moments. It’s not that the government is claiming to know best; it&#8217;s that we as individuals know best, but because we’re leaky vessels, we forget &#8211; and therefore willingly entrust the government with the task of drawing us back to our own, temporarily neglected, insights.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8646" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="14451317753_8923ae663e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, nationalism makes a valuable contribution to people’s lives. We should be able to feel proud of our countries &#8211; out of admiration for their virtues. It’s good for us, as individuals, to participate in projects that are bigger than ourselves: things we’d love to do but can’t manage on our own. At the moment we recognise this around sport. We argue for the extension of collective pride to other, more consequential, parts of life.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s wise to operate with a broad conception of politics. Politics should include a concern for psychotherapy and for what is broadcast on television. Aesthetics is a political matter: it matters how the world looks. The physical environment we create feeds back states of mind to us. Economics must be geared to the happiness of the greatest number. The task of politics is to create the platform for individual and collective flourishing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life sees itself as a political organisation.</span></i></p>
<p>8. <strong><em>The Media</em><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>The media is hugely important to our chances of fulfilment &#8211; because it gives a society a picture of itself, shapes the agenda of politics and claims to know what information is most vital to us.</p>
<p>However, very often, the media presents a challenge to our attempt to lead good lives; it prevents us from seeing the real issues and holding on to them, it is obsessed either by unhelpful ideologies or by a commitment to a bland neutrality of ideology; it is a breeding ground for feelings of undigested envy and material dissatisfaction; it fails to explain the economy to us; it informs us about disasters in other lands without granting us the tools for empathy; it constantly frightens and alarms us, heightening our sense of fragility; it leads us to distrust strangers and to have a very bleak view of collective life.</p>
<p>Part of learning how to stay sane is to have a robust approach for how to deal with the stream of incoming information from the media.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life ran a news organisation at </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.philosophersmail.com">www.philosophersmail.com</a>, set up <a title="News as therapy" href="http://newsastherapy.com" target="_blank">www.newsastherapy.com</a></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now runs a popular Youtube channel (<a href="http://youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv</a>). It is deeply interested in mass communication.</span></i></p>
<p>9. <strong><em>Consumerism </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a fairly widespread anxiety around consumption. Thoughtful people often complain that ‘we’ve become too consumerist’ or they say they’re sick of ‘materialism’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think that it’s not consumption or materialism &#8211; buying things and getting excited by possessions &#8211; that’s really the problem here. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is that we’ve not collectively made a clear distinction between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of these things. We agree there’s plenty of bad consumption around. But the way to deal with it is to beef up our capacity for good consumption. The same goes for materialism. It turns out there are very good kinds of materialistic behaviours.</span></p>
<p>Material objects can play positive psychological (or spiritual) roles in our lives. Our highest ideals can get ‘materialised’ in physical objects, so that by buying and using these things we’ll be getting closer to our better selves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.nest.co.uk/product-media/N0C/1200/900/Wastberg-Chipperfield-w102-Table-Lamp.jpg?resize=579%2C434" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be surprising to recall that religions have often been very in favour of certain kinds of materialism. At the core of Catholicism, for instance, was the idea that the faithful could get closer to Jesus by joining in a re-enactment of the Last Supper. The bread and wine &#8211; which believers consumed during the mass &#8211; were the outward, physical signs of the spiritual nourishment that was on offer. The big insight was that the ‘outward’ material parts were crucial. In theology this move was called ‘transubstantiation.’ It deserves a special word, because it’s a crucial idea: a physical object can take on a new spiritual identity, it can be the outward shape that a higher value needs to adopt in order to best be encountered in our lives. So, ideally, every good material possession ‘transubstantiates’ our psychological needs in a physical form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religions have often cared hugely what their temples look like, what clothes people wear in sacred places, how you should move, how loud you can speak, what the lighting should be like, how the furniture should be designed. In other words they had a host of strongly material concerns. But they had them because they were determined to get material things to serve a higher and noble purpose: the development of one’s soul.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8654" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_(Rafael)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same move applies outside of religions. Material objects are good when they support our own better nature and consumerism is good when it is geared to providing ourselves with these kinds of possessions. There’s a crucial constructive psychological role for possessions. And good consumerism occurs when people get really focused on finding the objects that can play this role for them. Hunting for the ideal alarm clock, or the perfect pair of socks, needn’t be the enemy of the wise and mature life.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life operates a retail unit at </span></i><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.theschooloflife.com/shop</span></i></a></p>
<p>10. <em><strong>Capitalism </strong></em></p>
<p>Economies look as if they are basically about huge material facts &#8211; oil fields, communications satellites, huge retail complexes, vast entertainment districts. But behind these impressive factors, we believe, that the economy is to an extraordinary extent a psychological phenomenon driven by our collective appetites and our imaginations and longings. It is what people are willing to pay for that generates profit and organises the whole system of investment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education of the customer is, therefore, one of the key economic moves for today. It was a big theme in the past. Some of the great thinkers focused their ambitions in this area. John Ruskin and William Morris hoped to transform the economy (and hence change how profits were made and who would get rich) by influencing what people wanted. They had ideas about what consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want, whereas today the most energetic efforts are made to track (and meet) whatever consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to want.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8656" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="aod-jaguar-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our big shot at influencing preferences and taste is via advertising. But that’s not usually got the real needs of the consumer at heart. What advertising does though is show how much can be done to shape taste and preference. We’d like to see equally creative and seductive advertising that was trying to promote the things we genuinely need (a couple might need to forgive each other more than they need a holiday; a child might need to feel less paralysed by homework, more than they need more take away pizza).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re very impressed by the productivity of capitalism &#8211; and we want to harness it to even more ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, capitalism has unsurprisingly tended to focus on the supply of our more basic needs. We’re interested in a kind of capitalism that operates further up Abraham Maslow’s famous Pyramid of Needs: that’s as efficient at meeting our needs for understanding as for sweet things to eat; that’s as great at helping us find OK partners as it is, at present, great at uniting us with the ideal sandwich.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8658" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png?resize=466%2C349" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we don’t think the question should be: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalism &#8211; yes or no? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core issue is about improving capitalism to make sure it is fulfilling our highest needs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life tries to tug businesses to make a better sort of capitalism via its business unit: </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/business">www.theschooloflife.com/business</a></span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the School of Life, we are keen to demonstrate that the proper role of ideas is to lead to the transformation of our societies in positive directions. We hope that our ideas will be, above all, ideas to live by.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cultural mining describes the process by which the most valuable parts of culture &#8211; by which we mean the arts, humanities and philosophy &#8211; are recovered and made useful for our own times.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cultural mining, the refined and practical essence of culture is carefully extracted, cleaned, blasted and remoulded &#8211; and then used to manufacture the utensils and mental resources that will help us navigate contemporary life; work, relationships, family, self-knowledge and so on.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18519962993_612979d290_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9543" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18519962993_612979d290_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="18519962993_612979d290_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a historic problem of major proportions that hugely valuable Cultural Insights have often been lodged within highly unappealing material far below ‘ground’. It has been dark and cramped in the corridors of culture and hardly anyone other than certain accredited experts have been tempted or allowed to visit. Their labours have had a lot of prestige, but in truth, the material has been like metal in ore, entirely impractical in its raw state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Culture to be useful to us, it needs to go through a process of refinement, which may involve quite radical, even drastic, moves. One needs to excise cultural insights from a lot of surrounding material. Insights have to be forcefully separated from contexts and then twinned with real world issues so as to bring out their dynamism. Insights have to be skilfully fitted to live contemporary problems so that their helpfulness emerges. They must be translated from an arcane language of the deep into a spoken language of the surface, culture moving from a learned to a living dialect. Finally, like in gold mining, only a very small portion of what had originally been dug out will ever be usable to make the finished precious item that is sought: a good idea.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9545" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is around this process of refinement that the big difference between us and academia becomes apparent. We&#8217;re very grateful to academia for digging the mineshafts and keeping open the tunnels &#8211; but we have a different project, we are interested in the extraction and utilisation of the material on the surface, rather than its preservation and interpretation below ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of cultural mining is new and still feels a little weird. But it has a critical role to play in our world because, at present, lots of people don&#8217;t &#8211; grievously &#8211; believe that culture has anything much to offer them. This isn’t their fault of course. When you look at the raw material form in which culture is generally laid out before us, that&#8217;s not surprising. But there is no need to stay stuck at this level forever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9546" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve only just started the business of cultural mining. We&#8217;re only now starting to extract the true value of culture in a systematic and ambitious way. But there is much to look forward to for, when we get to it, there is enough down there, deep in the often clammy and dark cultural ground, to help us meet the multiple confusions and anxieties of our times.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a distance, it seems weird, irrelevant, boring and yet also – just a little – intriguing. But it’s hard to put a finger on what the interest really is. What are philosophers? What do they do? And why does one need them? <span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the answer is already contained in the word</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> philosophy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. In Greek, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means love – or devotion – and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sophia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means wisdom. Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom. </span>Though a bit abstract, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence.</p>
<p>The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. You could perhaps say ‘happiness’ but ‘happiness’ is misleading, for it suggests continuous chirpiness and joy, whereas ‘fulfilment’ seems compatible with a lot of pain and suffering, which every decent life must by necessity have.</p>
<p>So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</p>
<p>Here are films on some of our favourite philosophers:</p>
<p><strong>1. Plato </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had the misfortune to do too much of it at school, you’ll probably remember one thing about history: just how boring it can be. </span>You might harbour painful memories of the 100 Years War, the War of Spanish Succession, Crop Rotation in the Middle Ages or &#8211; heaven forbid &#8211; the good deeds of Florence Nightingale. As a result, it wouldn’t be surprising if &#8211; nowadays &#8211; you tended to steer well clear of the whole topic.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8556" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But that would be a pity. The real reason why history is so boring is that we’re not clear about what it should be for. Here’s the big reason why history matters: it matters because it can provide us with solutions to many of the problems of the present.</p>
<p>At its best, history is there to introduce us to some of the things we need but that aren’t sufficiently visible in the world today. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As a society, we’re very obsessed by what we’re up to right now. Unknowingly, we’re hugely biased towards the present. The news &#8211; which is about the most prestigious force in the world today &#8211; circles obsessively around some of the things that have happened </span><b><i>in the last five minutes</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>And yet, many of the most important things that we need to nourish, sustain and inspire us, are a lot older.</p>
<p>What we nowadays need above all else are good ideas and history is full of them. Imagine you’re dissatisfied with aspects of contemporary Capitalism. It might help hugely to read about the slow emergence of Capitalism in Medieval Europe, so as to be able to trace its positives and negatives.</p>
<p>Of if you want to question how people get married, it helps to know a little more about the history of love&#8217;s relationship with marriage.</p>
<p>There are tons of missing ideas that have got wedged in the past; in volumes written long ago and not looked at in decades. Our films are attempts to rescue some of these ideas for our own times.</p>
<p><strong>1. Romanticism </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sociology is the academic study of social behaviour, particularly around work, love, class and status. It is &#8211; if you like &#8211; a form of very deep journalism. Like journalism, sociologists are interested in the way we live now, but unlike journalists, they go into things far more profoundly. Sociology has, in its history, asked such pertinent questions as: Why do people watch so much bad television? What is the relationship between class and cultural taste? Why do people commit suicide? And: why are some cultures individualistic and others more collective?</p>
<p>Here is a selection of our favourite sociologists:</p>
<p><strong>1. Max Weber</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political theorists are not interested in politics in the way it&#8217;s defined by news organisations; they don&#8217;t care about a specific bill going through parliament or the scandal surrounding a trade minister. They&#8217;re interested in politics in the big, and fascinating sense: the discipline that tries to work out how we can live well together in the <em>polis</em>, the community derived from the Greek word for city. Political theorists steps back from the day to day and ask large questions like: what is a good society? What is the relationship between freedom and liberty? How can a society pursue beauty and wisdom, as well as money?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8558" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Most political theorists have been philosophers; it&#8217;s natural to see why. Philosophers are interested in happiness, wisdom and fulfilment &#8211; and at some point, these issues will inevitably lead to questions about how the state and community are run. There is simply no more interesting or pertinent branch of philosophy than political theory. At the School of Life, we have defined some of our ideas in the section of this book called CAPITALISM. In the meantime, here are some of our favourite poltiical thinkers from history:</p>
<p><strong>1. Niccolò Machiavelli </strong></p>

<p>there&#8217;s often someone around who very quickly closes the discussion down by saying:</p>
<p class="p1"><b>“Beauty lies in the eye of the beholder”</b></p>
<p class="p1">It’s a phrase with the power to silence. Once it’s been uttered, trying to keep up a dialogue about the merits or drawbacks of certain visual things can come across as shrill, anti-social or just plain rude.</p>
<p class="p1">This tendency to surrender to relativism is a paradoxical symptom of a scientific age. Science, the most prestigious force in modern society, deals in objective truths. The things it passes judgement on are obviously simply <i>not</i> in the eye of beholders. One can&#8217;t fairly say: ‘Well I don’t really feel that way about the boiling point of water or the nature of gravity.’ We have to be subservient to the facts science hands down to us.</p>
<p class="p1">Yet because notions of beauty and ugliness lie outside the system of scientific proof, it’s routinely assumed that they must then lie in a realm of total relativism &#8211; and that no progress whatsoever can be made towards arriving at better or worse answers about what looks good. The certainties of science have &#8211; unwittingly &#8211; made sensible debate in the humanities feel imperious and redundant.</p>
<p class="p1">However, the phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ is in reality almost always unwarranted and deeply troublesome. It should, in our view, be avoided at all costs.</p>
<p class="p1">For a start, no one really believes in it to its core. We may well accept that there can be legitimate differences in taste within a reasonable spectrum; but we don&#8217;t actually think that <em>all</em> tastes are equal. If beauty simply lay in the eye of beholders, then it would presumably be sane to stand up and assert that a rubbish dump smelling of urine and decomposing fecal matter was a lovely place:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/12/17/1355749064055/landfill-rubbish-dump-uk-010.jpg?resize=620%2C372" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And that these modern canal side houses in Amsterdam were hideous:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/payload.cargocollective.com/1/4/137872/1838577/amsterdam%20architecture%20tour%20broneo2%20c%20kapungo.jpg?resize=615%2C450" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And it might then be logical to suggest that it would be OK to pull down the houses and replace them with a rubbish dump.</p>
<p class="p1">But of course, no one would want that &#8211; which shows that, in reality, we don’t actually believe that beauty does lie entirely in the eye of beholders. We have background aesthetic principles, even if we rarely articulate them &#8211; and are correspondingly very aware of moments when our tastes might clash with those of another.</p>
<p class="p1">When we use the phrase, what we seem to be trying to say is that there should be a lot of room for intelligent disagreement around aesthetics &#8211; and that we don’t feel comfortable about asserting the superiority of any one style or approach over any other. It implies an acute sensitivity to conflict and a fear of being rude or mean to others. However, by resorting to the phrase, what we actually do is unleash a stranger and more reckless situation: what we’re in effect stating is that nothing is ever really more beautiful &#8211; or uglier &#8211; than anything else.</p>
<p class="p1">This suggestion then has a way of implying that the whole subject is essentially trivial. After all, we’d never say that truths about the economy or justice were in the eyes of beholders only. We know that big things are at stake here &#8211; and over time, we&#8217;ve come to positions about the right and wrong way of approaching these topics, and are ready to discuss and defend our ideas. We wouldn&#8217;t ever say that &#8216;the treatment of the poor is just a subject best left entirely to the eyes of beholders&#8217; or &#8216;the best way to raise children is  in the eyes of beholders,&#8217; or &#8216;the future of the environment is in the eyes of beholders.&#8217; We accept that there are dangers to arguing in aggressive and unfruitful ways; but we are confident that there are sensible and polite ways to advance through these tricky yet vital debates. The same should feel true around beauty.</p>
<p class="p1">Partly, our reluctance to engage in aesthetic debate seems a symptom of a lack of confidence about our own tastes. Compare the way we behave over aesthetics to the way we behave around food and music, two fields where strong opinions and a love of arguing our case come naturally. Evaluating a new South-Asian restaurant on TripAdvisor, we&#8217;d be unlikely to say that &#8216;good restaurants just lie in the stomachs of eaters.&#8217; We&#8217;d have a point of view; we&#8217;d want to point out why place A was good, but place B was perhaps lacking in terms of its use of spices. We&#8217;d be opinionated, in interesting ways. Similarly, we would seldom say that music was in the ears of beholders, we&#8217;d have confidence in asserting that (say) Mozart had an edge over &#8216;The Wheels on the Bus go round and round&#8217; or London Grammar over the Verve. We&#8217;re not  here wanting to assert that one musician is better than another; we&#8217;re simply pointing to the legitimacy and interest of the debate and to the odd refusal even to start such a discussion in relation to architecture and art. Our neutral stance on aesthetics seems a symptom more of tentative taste than of any true commitment to relativism.</p>
<p class="p1">Furthermore, though calling for an end to discussion about beauty may seem a kindly, generous move, it is extremely convenient for property developers to operate in a society that has no confidence in people’s ability to make judgments about whether or not things are beautiful or monstrous. It means these cash-conscious types don’t have to worry about going to the expense of trying to make anything look good: because no one knows what that is anyway!</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3798657_23229d73.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8022" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3798657_23229d73.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="3798657_23229d73" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ originally came to prominence as a shield to protect us against snobbery.</p>
<p class="p1">It asserted the rights of ordinary people to follow their enthusiasms at a time when high-handed experts held the cultural reins and tried to shape taste with stern and belittling authority. These experts told people what to like and treated dissent with disdain. The phrase ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ was a defense against intolerance. It meant something like: ‘Stop trying to badger me into submission. My preferences are my personal call. I can think and feel as I like.’</p>
<p class="p1">But given that the freedom to think and feel as we like is now very well enshrined (indeed, perhaps too well enshrined), we don’t need to stay stuck at the early liberating move.</p>
<p class="p1">Our day-to-day problem isn’t that we’ll be bossed around by cultural snobs, it’s that the chances of attractive art and architecture taking hold will be lost, because of a culture obsessed by quick profits and a refusal to engage architects and artists in a dialogue about what they&#8217;re up to. Closing conversation down with ‘beauty lies in the eye of the beholder’ can make an already tricky situation far worse. A society that can’t talk sensibly, publicly and perhaps at length, about beauty will inadvertently condemn itself to ugliness.</p>

<p>A designed object is one whose makers worked long and hard to get it just right. Most of the world has sadly not been well-designed. But good design does matter. Far from being a luxury or an add-on, it is central to a good society. We feel like and are, in a sense, quite different people depending on what&#8217;s in front of our eyes.</p>

<p class="p2">Philosophy begins in the Ancient World where it is immediately thought of as a highly practical discipline close to what we would nowadays think of as psychotherapy. One goes to see a philosopher to clear up a variety of emotional and intellectual confusions. The job of being a philosopher becomes extremely prestigious. Different schools of philosophy form, each one claiming a better grasp on the ingredients of true calm and fulfilment than the next. Here are the four great strands of Ancient Greek philosophy:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1. Plato</strong></p>

Since then, it has achieved enormous popularity, by virtue of its practical orientation and its devotion to cures for everyday ailments of the soul.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When it comes to design and decoration, it feels extremely tricky and dangerous to accuse anyone of having ‘bad taste’ or to pride oneself on having good taste. The official story is that anything goes – and no one knows what’s good or bad anyway.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that seems too easy and lacking in ambition. Progress can in fact be made on this important issue – if we try to understand what psychological mechanisms govern the business of taste in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we have the taste we have? Why are we attracted or repelled by certain sorts of styles? The best way to interpret this is via a theory of <em>compensation</em>. We’re all a bit unbalanced inside and get attracted to styles in the world that promise to compensate us for the things we’re lacking within. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So for example, people who feel chaotic, undisciplined and cluttered inside, are liable to be very drawn to interiors that are serene, pure and poised.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, people who are very exposed to, and oppressed by the hurried tempo of modern life – with its excessive brutality, precision and technological awe &#8211; are likely to be drawn to styles that speak of the rustic, the natural and the cosily shabby.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/petitetrianon4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5792" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/petitetrianon4.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="petitetrianon4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that might be an explanation for taste; but what about ‘bad’ taste? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What singles out instances of ‘bad taste’ is excess in some direction or another: bad taste is a massive overcompensation, which has been generated by a sharp short-fall in some area or another. It’s a response to a psychological or physical trauma.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So for example, the Russians and the Saudis have over the years developed a reputation for spectacularly bad, as in gaudy and over-the-top, taste: a pumped version of Versailles in Riyadh or Moscow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ATT00139.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5794" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ATT00139.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="ATT00139" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t, in a sense, surprising: a century of extreme deprivation under Communism and an eternity of eking out a living in the barren deserts of Saudi Arabia have created understandably desperate desires for compensation – which have evidently rather overshot their mark. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or think of sentimental ‘bad’ taste: the kind where there are gnomes in the front gardens and gaudy and sickly sweet trinkets inside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/497339343.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5796" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/497339343.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="497339343" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a style frequently favoured by the less well-off in society, people whose working lives are humiliating, backbreaking and the very opposite of welcoming or tender. It should be no wonder that these unfortunates might therefore be in the mood for something counterbalancingly sweet at home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In every instance of bad taste, we’re looking at the over-eager embracing of a good quality – like sweetness, freedom, fun or prosperity – that was once in very short supply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/chip_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5795" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/chip_01.jpg?resize=635%2C312" alt="chip_01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad taste often sickens people but once one understands its origins, it starts to seem unduly harsh to judge like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can all understand that if a person is starving, they might eagerly eat things which, in less desperate situations, they’d obviously reject – and that in their desperation, their manners might take a back seat. It’s not at all pretty – but we’d never blame them, because we know why they’re stuffing themselves with such haste.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should apply similar tact when confronted with unfortunate tastes in design. What’s ‘bad’ in bad taste isn’t the person, but the prior trauma which they are seeking to compensate for through their decor. There’s no point in mocking – or offering lectures about art history. The problem isn’t a lack of information. It is a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PM-270214-chairA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5797" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PM-270214-chairA1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="Iraq End of Victory" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to bad taste is therefore political. Good taste comes about when people feel appreciated, when there’s enough to go around and when there’s an economy which doesn’t routinely humiliate and abase its workers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To make good taste more widespread, what matters above all are efforts to diminish the desperate lives in which lapses of taste invariably have their origins.</span></p>

<p>Fewer and fewer people believe nowadays. It&#8217;s possible that in a generation there simply won&#8217;t be religion across Europe and large sections of North America, Australia and Asia. That&#8217;s not necessarily a problem. But it&#8217;s worth thinking about why people made up religion in the first place, and what we&#8217;re doing with the needs and longings that lead them to do so.</p>
<p>We have four films on the subject:</p>
<p><strong>1. After Religion</strong></p>

<p>We have a general sense that the humanities are filled with things that are deeply important. But what exactly are they for?</p>
<p>The humanities are a repository of useful and consoling ideas that can help us face pressing personal and professional issues. We can turn to novels and historical narratives to impart moral instruction, paintings to reawaken our empathetic powers, and philosophy to probe our anxieties and offer consolation.</p>
<p>Here we look at four great strands of the humanities and ask how they can help us live:</p>
<p><strong>1. What is Art For? </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, philosophy has been nervous around the idea of communication. Reaching out has not been high on the agenda. Academic philosophers have frequently erected barriers to wider participation: abstruse vocabulary and hypercomplex arguments have seemed to guarantee intelligence – all of which is a great pity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy is simply the pursuit of wisdom. And though it’s a rather abstract term, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence. The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philoclass.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3717" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philoclass.jpeg?resize=555%2C375" alt="University students and professor have philosophy discussion on floor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why there is always a need to make wisdom widespread: something for the many, not just for the few. It’s a need that is especially great in societies like ours which are driven by the currents of popular opinion and mass consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s on this basis that we started a YouTube channel, which you&#8217;ll find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A YouTube channel shouldn’t be seen as a painful concession to the lamentable demands of a coarsened world. It is, in fact, bringing philosophy closer to its true ideal. Because wisdom clearly does not in the end belong merely in a seminar room or academic hall. It belongs in the day-to-day practices and mental habits of our lives. Philosophy is how you handle rejection, or cope with frustration or work out how to help another person – these are the real goals for which the finest intellectual labour is only at best the preparation (and sadly from which it can be a terrible distraction).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The technology is of recent date, but the underlying move is not new. A YouTube philosophy channel is just today’s version of the windows of Chartres Cathedral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/window.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3718" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/window.jpeg?resize=635%2C404" alt="The Good Samaritan cares for the Pilgrim, stained glass, Chartres Cathedral, France, 1205-1215." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Middle Ages, leading thinkers knew that hardly anyone would read their theological treatises. They didn’t quietly resent the situation. They took action. They realised the importance of popularisation. They accepted that a glowing, vivid stained-glass window could achieve much the same as a book, and could be used alongside literature as an aide to the ultimate goals of enlightenment. The point of the window was to show why being kind – why helping a stranger in need is a good thing to do. But writing books or essays isn’t the only way to put this argument forward. What’s needed for many is encouragement and stimulation of a more emotional, direct kind. So the windows are brought in to tell the story of the Good Samaritan in a vivid way. We can see the unpopular man who is moved by ordinary, and effective, generosity to help another in their hour of need. The windows are not ‘selling out’ or cheapening the message, they’re bringing it to life in a narrative, visual manner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task is to carry from one end of society to the other, the best knowledge and the best ideas of our time. We should be trying to divest philosophy of all that is harsh, uncouth, difficult, abstract, professional, exclusive about it. We need to humanise it – and to make it efficient outside the clique of the cultivated and learned.</span></p>
<p class="p1">In a populist, market driven society, it is no use keeping philosophy for the few, and writing books that only a hundred people can understand. The real task is to know how to popularise. If philosophy is to be properly powerful, it has to learn to be popular first. Therefore, do check in regularly to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, please subscribe and pass the news on to friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14545939465_eb39392947_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9732" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14545939465_eb39392947_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="14545939465_eb39392947_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There is widespread agreement that art is very important. But it can be remarkably hard to say quite why, or what it is <em>for</em>.</p>
<p>Here at The Book of Life (and its associated arm, The School of Life) we have a particular ideology about art. We believe that art is a tool which should help us to cope with a variety of cognitive frailties: it should help us to understand ourselves, empathise with others, guide us to morality, console us for our sorrows and function as an agent of hope.</p>
<p>The doctrine that art should be &#8216;for art&#8217;s sake&#8217; seems to us to be highly defeatist and pernicious. One is not doing art an injustice by ascribing a clear function to it. Far from it, one is saving it from irrelevance and the melancholy notion that it exists merely as a distraction or an ineffable and mysterious side-show to the main business of love and work. For most of human history, art was in the service of religions. We believe that where once art helped with the problems of theology, it should now assist us with the challenges of psychology.</p>
<p>To this end, we have created a microsite, an online museum, but with a difference. The site functions by taking a reading of your state of mind &#8211; and then matching you to an art-work, and a caption which will hopefully shift your consciousness in a useful direction.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People living in pleasant rural towns across the south of England, places like Chipping Norton and Ashford, are horrified by government aspirations to build thousands of new homes in the surrounding fields – to satisfy enormous public demand. The residents look out of their windows at oak trees, meadows and hedgerows, and vow to vote out of office anyone with any intentions of relaxing the tight planning regulations currently in force.</p>
<p>The consequences of their objections are highly significant. They are causing a grave housing crisis. Far fewer homes have been built than there is demand for, prices have risen relentlessly, mortgages are ruinous, huge numbers of people are sentenced to long commutes; and owning a decent house has become the task of a lifetime. It’s a social disaster.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to call the objectors selfish. But to solve the crisis they have created, it’s wiser, and more strategic, to try to get under the skin of people too easily dismissed as NIMBYs.</p>
<p>Most of the large housing developments built in the South East of England in the last 25 years share one common and (in this context) generally undiscussed feature: they are very ugly. Or, to be more precise, they are far uglier than the countryside they have replaced.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5043" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessA.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PM-290114-uglinessA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In the mid-18th century, people looked on without dismay as the hills around the little town of Bath were given up to Queen Square, the Royal Crescent and Somerset Place.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5044" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessB.jpg?resize=635%2C255" alt="PM-290114-uglinessB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Few minded the lost fields</h5>
<p>Likewise, a little further back, when the wetlands, scrubby reed beds and sandy islands at the mouth of the River Po were sacrificed to urban expansion, few people were likely to have raised protests – given what would come to replace them.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessC.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5045" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessC.gif?resize=635%2C293" alt="PM-290114-uglinessC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5046" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessD.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>History shows us that people don’t object to new housing per se, they object when the houses are less beautiful than the natural landscape they have devoured. This starts to isolate the cause of Britain’s housing crisis – as well as to point the way to a solution to it. It is, literally, ugliness that is to blame for the current social catastrophe. What seems like negative and entrenched NIMBYism is at heart an inarticulate, disguised but understandable plea for grace, elegance and a touch of grandeur.</p>
<p>The answer isn’t to build replicas of Georgian crescents, let alone rows of canal-side Gothic palaces (any more than it would be an idea for someone who loved the English language to begin addressing strangers in Shakespearean dialect). The answer is to create housing developments in the best architectural idiom of our times, places like – for example – the exceptional Accordia housing scheme in the suburbs of Cambridge (to which, unsurprisingly, no one objected).</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5047" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessE.jpg?resize=635%2C372" alt="PM-290114-uglinessE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Solving the housing crisis requires that we get better at grasping the nature of the problem we’re facing: the issue isn’t stubborn selfishness. It’s a longing for beauty. Crack that, and no one will mind the felled trees too much, and mortgages will come down too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Although many of us like comedy a lot, it feels odd to ask basic questions about its purpose. &#8216;What is comedy for?’ sounds like a leaden inquiry directly opposed to the spirit of humour.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But really it is a way of getting more ambitious about what laughter can do for us. Intuitively, we feel that comedy is one of the things that helps us cope with the difficulties of living. </span>A clue can be found in the fact &#8211; which at first sounds a bit surprising &#8211; that we don’t laugh at things unless they cause us very serious problems at other points in life. We can see this in the standard category of jokes: about relationships, family, sex, money, impotence, bowel movements&#8230; We laugh most readily around things that in other ways are very distressing. A good joke invariably has a relationship with darkness, anxiety and pain.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6501" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="jan-6-david-brent-dance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">David Brent taps into a deep source of anxiety: making a fool of oneself at work</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy offers us a way of having a better time around things which, otherwise, can feel pretty disastrous. Ideally, in the utopia, comedy and its therapeutic potential wouldn’t be left to chance. Humour would be deliberately cultivated as a benign response to a range of entrenched difficulties. Previously, certain countries had an elaborate carnival season devoted to enforced comic activities. For a brief time, the weak could boss around the powerful, priests and nuns were supposed to hold obscene rituals in their churches, serious people were required to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>get drunk and throw bags of flour over each other’s heads. Humour wasn’t just left to those who felt so inclined: it was a kind of duty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, the idea of the court jester &#8211; an officially licensed and salaried comic &#8211; was built on the importance of humour to the mental health of the powerful. Even if in the council room or around the dinner table, the leading people didn’t feel much like joking, the jester was required to make barbed, witty and perhaps mocking remarks to deflate pomposity and restore perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy is so important, its presence should be embedded in the calendar and in the fabric of institutions. It’s a requirement &#8211; like having our teeth checked or doing the accounts. There are perhaps six key ways that comedy offers us therapeutic help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Comedy as Therapy for Despair</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of our gravest problems don’t have viable solutions. We suffer, and then die. Work is painful,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but we can’t escape it. There is no happily ever after in love…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A common artistic response has been to accept the darkness, to express it with dignity and to nudge the audience towards greater compassion for self and others. This is the spirit of Velazquez’s rendition of the dying Christ:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cristo_crucificado.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6502" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cristo_crucificado.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="A 4158" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A comic attitude doesn’t deny misery,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but it has a very different relationship with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/life-of-brian-1979-03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6503" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/life-of-brian-1979-03.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="life-of-brian-1979--03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Defiance in the face of suffering</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black humour is infused with a mood of defiance. One is going to laugh at, rather than buckle in front of, the miseries of existence. In<em> The Life of Brian, </em>the closing song brazenly states the worst about existence: ‘Life&#8217;s a piece of shit, when you look at it’. But instead of making us more aware of our feelings of sorrow (as tragedy does), the mood is mocking; there is a refusal to be gloomy: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ‘Always look on the bright side of life… purse your lips and give a whistle’. </span></p>
<p class="p1">In 1940, when Britain was in a precarious military situation, with the evacuation of Dunkirk and nightly bombing raids, a song mocking the Nazi leaders became wildly popular:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hitler has only got one ball,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Göring has two but very small,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Himmler has something sim&#8217;lar,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic mockery didn’t remotely depend upon it being thought literally true. The enemy’s power was all too terrifyingly apparent. The point was simply that keeping cheerfully defiant was centrally important to the task of facing up to something very frightening indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black humour works on the assumption that we tend to despair too soon: that is, the situation feels more hopeless than it really is. It’s genuinely bad, but we experience it as truly catastrophic. We give up hope and thereby surrender our capacity to do what we still can to make things a little better. By mocking dangerous things, humour emboldens us. It helpfully paints what is potentially very frightening as deeply ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6515" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.png?resize=635%2C565" alt="image16" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Two remarkably small testicles</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Comedy as Therapy for Humiliation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is filled with things which threaten our dignity. We’re never far from being reduced to complete mockery. In the children’s television series Peppa Pig, the father &#8211; Daddy Pig &#8211; is always doing things that could be seen as absurd, humiliating or embarrassing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6516" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image10.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the opening sequence, </span>he makes loud, rather obnoxious grunts. On a very hot day, he falls asleep in the sun and gets very red; Mummy and the children tip the contents of the paddling pool over him. Generally, around the house, he likes to do a bit of DIY and put up shelves: but everything he does is a bit wonky. He tends to get lost when driving the car. He’s overweight. He can come across as lazy. It would be extremely easy to make a very negative assessment of his character. That’s the kind of thing we tend to do for ourselves and other people: we regularly rehearse the case for the prosecution.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the cartoons, though, this very flawed creature is presented as somehow both flawed and extremely lovable: his wife and children are deeply attached to him and think he’s lovably clumsy. They don’t get to this positive verdict by not noticing his failings. They’re clearly very conscious of them &#8211; and they do tease him about his incompetence and tendency to take things a bit too easy. They do see him as a bit of an idiot. It’s just that they love him as he is. In their eyes he is a lovable fool. That’s what a lot of comedy helps us with. It turns people (ourselves included) who could just be seen as idiots into lovable fools.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we happened to walk down the road and saw a man called Basil Fawlty bashing his car with the branch of a tree, we’d feel he was just some awful, furious, bloke venting his anger in a crazed, destructive way. We’d judge him a thoroughly unpleasant fool.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6517" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image031.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Losing your temper doesn’t have to mean you&#8217;re an entirely bad person</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately for Basil Fawlty, he’s not in real life but in a comedy by John Cleese and therefore, he isn’t just an idiot, he is a lovable fool. His vices are introduced alongside some deeply ingratiating qualities. The show teaches us to really like someone whom in real life we might have cursed. When we watch the show we’re on Basil’s side: we don’t withdraw our sympathy. The show is getting us to try out the unusual experience of simultaneously accepting that someone is crazy and still quite nice. We accept that Cleese’s character is sly, selfish, mean, incredibly tactless, snobbish and rude. And yet we like him. It’s a remarkable achievement on the part of the comedy team. </span>We’re rehearsing a move we need to make with others and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; with ourselves.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daddy Pig and Fawlty Towers are developing an idea initially sketched by Jesus Christ. Christianity introduced the idea that a person could be of low social status, of ignoble appearance, lack talent and yet be fully deserving of love and consideration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6518" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jesus was setting an example of <em>liking</em> people who could be seen as very unimpressive, because, seen in a particular light, pretty much everyone can be made to look a fool. The question is whether we have to see foolishness as inviting derision and contempt, or might come to view it as fully compatible with tenderness and affection &#8211; in fact, with love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Comedy as Therapy for Self-disgust</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be pretty hard to live with ourselves; we’re so painfully aware of the gap between our ideals of how we’d like to be and the reality of how we actually are. So often we’re left feeling lonely with our flaws, failings and rather sordid ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7142" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Isabelle</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lazy about the laundry and rubbish at loading the dishwasher</span></h5>
<p class="p1">Confessional comedy works by someone standing on stage and admitting in public that they have all the kinds of faults which we normally feel embarrassed and ashamed about. They interrupt our loneliness by admitting that they too get shy in public WCs and don&#8217;t know whether to shake hands with or hug acquaintances. We laugh with relief, as the pent-up anxiety is safely discharged.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They dismantle the secret fear of our own freakishness: and by making things feel more normal they make them more bearable too. Michael McIntyre makes public the little failings of parental life: how he can’t get his children to get their shoes and coats on, how he lazily hopes to get away with merely putting the dishes ‘near the dishwasher’ when cleaning up (‘would you pee near the toilet?’ he asks himself). They are often tiny, trivial things of course. That’s the point. Officially everyone manages just fine. Only in fact we don’t. And by portraying what he’s really like &#8211; rather than what an adult is meant to be like &#8211; Michael McIntyre is offering an antidote to self-disgust. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Comedy as Benevolent Stereotyping</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If someone says ‘You’re a bit of a Woody Allen’, it’s a benign alternative to thinking: &#8216;you’re a deeply annoying, over-intellectual neurotic nerd&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6520" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C483" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p1">Across his career, Woody Allen showed how quite negative characteristics could be reframed in a more endearing light. He provided a new &#8211; more kindly and insightful &#8211; way of stereotyping people. The problem with stereotypes is not so much that they generalise, but that they so often generalise unfairly and unkindly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin_46535c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6523" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin_46535c.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Kevin_46535c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If parents get entertained by Harry Enfield’s character, Kevin the teenager, they can move from the panicked thought ‘our son has turned into a monster’ to the more constructive and less frightening idea that ‘my son has temporarily become Kevin the teenager’. It breaks the potential isolation and misery. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the reverse of bad stereotyping. Comic characters almost always hold onto our sympathy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6524" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To say that a work colleague is a bit of a David Brent isn’t merely to point out that they are tactless and insecure. It’s also to reframe those failings. Because we come to feel tender towards David Brent too. We see his vulnerability &#8211; not just his idiocy; we become good at recognising that it’s his anxiety about not being liked or respected that leads him to do deeply embarrassing things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry_David.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6525" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry_David.jpg?resize=635%2C630" alt="Larry_David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Larry David is always getting angry and abusive. He is incredibly combative and rude to waiters; he gets into huge arguments with people at the dry cleaners; he tells his friends what he thinks of their partners; he speaks his mind, even when it is totally inappropriate. But at the same time, he’s very charming. He’s a successful man, he has a lovely smile, he can be very sweet. So we’re reframing the ‘grumpy old man’ as ‘the charming, very engaging old man who is &#8211; frequently rude too.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic move is to guide us to a benevolent conception of these people &#8211; and hence to the parts of ourselves and those close to us who share some potentially very annoying characteristics. As a society, we need a lot more benevolent comic characters to be created &#8211; to help us cope with the infinite variety of maddening people around us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Comedy as Therapy for Power and Powerlessness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6526" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely reassuring to see the powerful laughing at themselves. Finding oneself comical is a token of maturity. It means being able to see one’s faults, without being too defensive about them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing that intimidates us isn’t actually power. It’s power that looks like it’s going to be inhumane: insensitive, unkind power. So we’re intently interested in things that reveal a mature, kindly sort of power. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Humour often provides a mechanism whereby the powerless (or at least the less powerful) can give constructive but pointed feedback to the powerful. Monty Python was particularly focused on this task. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6527" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image05.jpg?resize=635%2C275" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Philosophers&#8217; Football Match mocks the great figures of intellectual history. It’s funny because we’ve been intimidated so deeply in the past by intellectual bullies who made us feel small with their references to Wittgenstein and Schopenhauer. And now these great totemic figures of intellectual life are shown as completely rubbish at football. The sketch is an attempt to show academic philosophers that they’ve needlessly frightened people and cut themselves off from the general public. The sketch is really a coded plea to philosophy to be kinder and more relevant. Monty Python have to be funny about philosophers because so far philosophers have been stubbornly bad at being funny and human about themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Comedy as Therapy for Losing Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We lose perspective all the time: a problem that is of moderate, manageable size can easily start to look much bigger than it really is. We get into a huge panic, or feel very endangered and react in ways that make the situation worse. Without meaning to, we exaggerate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic technique for dealing with exaggeration is to exaggerate so much that our own inflated ideas come to seem small by comparison. It’s natural, for example, to worry that one’s conduct is inappropriate: that everyone else knows what you’re supposed to do and does it easily, while you don’t know the right thing and inadvertently make a fool of yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6528" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might clap at the wrong moment in a concert hall; laugh during a speech at something that was meant to be serious; mistake the drinks waiter for your host, or say something that everyone else thinks in appalling taste. You can, however, not possibly reach the levels of cringe-worthy behaviour of Mr Bean. By comparison with him, your faux-pas is bound to look small. That’s part of the consolation of comedy. It exaggerates so much, it restores us to a sense of our own normality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The savage comedy <em>The Thick of It</em> presents the political world as infinitely dysfunctional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/malcolmtucker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6529" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/malcolmtucker.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="malcolmtucker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The characters are utterly incompetent and lost or hideously brutal. Like <em>Mr Bean</em> it presents us with a strategic exaggeration. Our tendency to despair of politics and politicians is not simply taken seriously, it is magnified and multiplied. By comparison with <em>The Thick of It,</em> actual political life looks fairly reasonable and sane. We don&#8217;t ever have to feel envious of high-ranking politicians. They are all awful, and our own lives rather nice by comparison.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to see comedy through the romantic lens of the one-off inspired comic whose unique view of the world is entertaining. But the focus on the individual witty voice misses the gigantic, political nature of the task of comedy. Comedy isn’t just a bit of fun. The comic perspective fills a central need of every society; it enables us to cope much better with our own follies and disappointments, our troubles around work and love and our difficulties enduring ourselves. Comedy is waiting to be reframed as a central tool behind the creation of a better world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At The School of Life, we are taking our first steps in comedy with these films:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays we’re used to thinking of travel as the ‘fun’ bit of life, but enjoyment isn’t a reason why it shouldn’t also do some very serious things for us. At its deepest level, travel can assist us with our psychological education. It can – when approached the right way – play a critical role in helping us to grow into better versions of our normal selves. When it corrects the imbalances and immaturities of our natures, travel reveals its full potential to function as a form of therapy in our lives.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But in order to work a therapeutic effect, we need to change how we go about choosing our destinations. We should recognise that we’re badly served here by the travel industry, which cuts the world up into material categories almost entirely unattuned to the needs of our souls. It will lay before us options like ‘outdoor fun,’ ‘family adventure’ ‘culture weekends’ or ‘island hideaways’ – but leave it unexplored quite what the point of these destinations might be when considered from the point of view of our psyches.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-882" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1489435532.jpg" alt="Paris Plage 2012 Official Launch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Without anything mystical being meant by it, all of us are involved in one way or another on what could be termed ‘an inner journey’: that is, we’re trying to develop in particular ways. We might be searching for how to be calmer or how to find a way to rethink our goals, we might long for a greater sense of confidence or an escape from debilitating feelings of envy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ideally, where we go should help us with our attempts at these longed-for pieces of psychological evolution. The outer journey should assist us with the inner one. But for this to happen, we need to be clearer in our minds both what we’re searching for inside and what the outer world could conceivably deliver for us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In part, this requires us to look at the globe in a new way. Every destination we might alight upon contains within it qualities, virtues one might say, that could conceivably support some move or other on a person’s inner journey. There are places that could help with shyness and others with anxiety. Some places might be good at reducing egoism and others might be good for helping us think more clearly about the future.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/450362875.jpg" alt="General Views of Arena Pantanal &amp; Surrounding Areas - FIFA World Cup Venues Brazil 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one has yet written a psychological atlas of the world, outlining the so-called psychological virtues of places, but it’s a project that urgently needs to be undertaken. Such an atlas would align destinations with their inner potential. For example, we’d see that the Utah desert is both a physical destination – made up of 200 million-year-old stones that stretch out as far as the eye can see in a soothing pink hue – and a psychological one: capable of functioning as a goad to perspective, an aide to shift away from preoccupations with the petty and the small-minded towards a terrain of greater calm and resilience.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the future, we would ideally be more conscious travellers – aware that we were on a search for places that could deliver psychological virtues like ‘calm’ or ‘perspective,’ ‘sensuality’ or ‘rigour’. A visitor to Monument Valley wouldn’t just be in it for a bit of undefined ‘adventure’, something to enjoy and then gradually forget about two weeks later; travelling to the place would be an occasion fundamentally to reorient one’s personality. It would be the call-to-arms to become a different person; an 8,000 mile, £3,000 secular pilgrimage that would be properly anchored around a piece of profound character development.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-876" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/179800813.jpg" alt="Utah, Church Rock at junction of US Route 191 and Utah Route 211 the entrance to the Needles section of Canyon lands National Park" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Travel should not be allowed to escape the underlying seriousness of the area of life with which it deals. We need always to aim for locations in the outer world that can push us towards where we need to go within.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the coming two weeks, we are leaving the office to send you ‘postcards’ from a variety of locations around the world that will demonstrate the theory of ‘travel as therapy’ in action – and hopefully inspire you on therapeutic journeys of your own.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">People are understandably confused about what philosophy is. From a distance, it seems weird, irrelevant, boring and yet also – just a little – intriguing. But it’s hard to put a finger on what the interest really is. What are philosophers? What do they do? And why does one need them?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, the answer is already contained in the word philosophy itself. In Greek, philo means love – or devotion – and sophia means wisdom. Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2856" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sunset.jpg" alt="Visitors Enjoy The Wildlife At The Farne Islands" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though a rather abstract term, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence. The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. You could perhaps say ‘happiness’ but ‘happiness’ is misleading, for it suggests continuous chirpiness and joy, whereas ‘fulfilment’ seems compatible with a lot of pain and suffering, which every decent life must by necessity have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their pursuit of wisdom, philosophers have developed a very specific skill-set. They have, over the centuries, become experts in many of the general, large things that make people not very wise. Six central ones have been identified:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. We don’t ask big questions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the meaning of life? What should I do with my work? Where are we going as a society? What is love? Most of us have these questions in our minds at some point (often in the middle of the night), but we despair of trying to answer them. They have the status of jokes in most social circles: and we get shy of expressing them (except for brief moments in adolescence) for fear of being thought pretentious and of getting nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But these questions matter deeply because only with sound answers to them can we direct our energies meaningfully.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2864" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blinding.jpg" alt="BRITAIN-ARHCITECTURE-WEATHER" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophers are people unafraid of the large questions. They have, over the centuries, asked the very largest. They realise that these questions can always be broken down into more manageable chunks and that the only really pretentious thing is to think one is above regularly raising naive-sounding enquiries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. We are vulnerable to errors of common sense</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public opinion – or what gets called ‘common sense’ – is sensible and reasonable in countless areas. It’s what you hear about from friends and neighbours, the stuff that’s just assumed to be true, the stuff you take in without even thinking about it. The media pumps it out by the gallon every day. But in some cases, common sense is also full of daftness, error and the most lamentable prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/socrates-635x691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4490" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/socrates-635x691.jpg?resize=635%2C513" alt="Athens, Greece - 10 Mar 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy gets us to submit all aspects of common sense to reason. It wants us to think for ourselves, to be more independent. Is it really true what people say about love, about money, about children, about travel, about work? Philosophers are interested in asking whether an idea is logical – rather than simply assuming it must be right because it is popular and long-established.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. We are mentally confused</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not very good at knowing what goes on in our own minds. We know we really like a piece of music. But we struggle to say quite why. Or someone we meet is very annoying, but we can’t pin down what the issue is. Or we lose our temper, but can’t readily tell what we’re so cross about. We lack insight into our own satisfactions and dislikes.</span></p>
<p class="p2">That’s why we need to examine our own minds. Philosophy is committed to self-knowledge – and its central precept – articulated by the earliest, greatest philosopher, Socrates – is just two words long: Know yourself.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. We have muddled ideas about what will make us happy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re powerfully set on trying to be happy, but go wrong in our search for it on a regular basis. We overrate the power of some things to improve our lives – and underrate others. In a consumer society, we make the wrong choices because, guided by false glamour, we keep on imagining that a particular kind of holiday, or car, or computer will make a bigger difference than it can. At the same time, we underestimate the contribution of other things – like going for a walk, tidying a cupboard, having a structured conversation or going to bed early – which may have little prestige but can contribute deeply to the character of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2866" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/497348829.jpg" alt="Urban Gardening" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophers seek to be wise by getting more precise about the activities and attitudes that really can help our lives to go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Our emotions can send us in dangerous directions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are inescapably emotional beings but regularly forget this uncomfortable fact. Occasionally certain emotions – certain kinds of anger, envy or resentment – lead us into serious trouble. Philosophers teach us to think about our emotions, rather than simply have them. By understanding and analysing our feelings, we learn to see how emotions impact on our behaviour in unexpected, counterintuitive and sometimes dangerous ways. Philosophers were the first therapists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. We panic and lose perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are constantly losing a sense of what matters and what doesn’t. We are – as the expression goes – constantly ‘losing perspective’. That’s what philosophers are good at keeping a hold of. On hearing the news that he’d lost all his possessions in a shipwreck, the Stoic philosopher Zeno simply said: ‘Fortune commands me to be a less encumbered philosopher.’ It’s responses like these that have made the very term ‘philosophical’ a byword for calm, long-term thinking and strength-of-mind, in short, for perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call the ‘history of philosophy‘ is made up of repeated attempts over the centuries to address ways in which we are unwise. So, for example, in ancient Athens, Socrates paid special attention to the problem of how people get confused in their minds. He was struck that people didn’t quite know what they meant by key ideas – like courage or justice or success – even though these were the main ideas they used when talking about their own lives. Socrates developed a method (which still bears his name) by which you can learn to get clearer about what you mean by playing devil’s advocate with any idea. The aim isn’t necessarily to change your mind. It is to test whether the ideas guiding your life are sound.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2867" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/169994583.jpg" alt="Metropolis At The Bosporus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few decades later, the philosopher Aristotle tried to make us more confident around big questions. He thought that the best questions were those that ask what something is for. He did this a lot and over many books, asked: What is government for? What is the economy for? What is money for? What is art for? Today he would be encouraging us to ask questions like: What is the news media for? What is marriage for? What are schools for? What is pornography for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also active in Ancient Greece were the Stoic philosophers, who were interested in panic. The Stoics noticed a really central feature of panic: we panic not just when something bad occurs, but when it does so unexpectedly, when we were assuming that everything was going to go rather well. So they suggested that we should arm ourselves against panic by getting used to the idea that danger, trouble and difficulty are very likely to occur at every turn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall task of studying philosophy is to absorb these and many other lessons and put them to work in the world today. The point isn’t just to know what this or that philosopher happened to say, but to aim to exercise wisdom at an individual and societal level – starting now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2925" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3261760103_1b9210f02b_b.jpg" alt="3261760103_1b9210f02b_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wisdom of philosophy is – in modern times – mostly delivered in the form of books. But in the past, philosophers sat in market squares and discussed their ideas with shopkeepers or went into government offices and palaces to give advice. It wasn’t abnormal to have a philosopher on the payroll. Philosophy was thought of as a normal, basic activity – rather than as an unusual, esoteric, optional extra.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nowadays, it’s not so much that we overtly deny this thought – we are always getting snippets of wisdom here and there – but we just don’t have the right institutions set up to promulgate wisdom coherently in the world. In the future, though, when the value of philosophy is a little clearer, we can expect to meet more philosophers in daily life. They won’t be locked up, living mainly in university departments, because the points at which our unwisdom bites – and messes up our lives – are multiple and urgently need attention right now.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/planes1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4494" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/planes1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="Parachute troops of the US 501st Battalion at Fort Benning, Georgia. - 1-May-1941" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you had the misfortune to do too much, or the wrong kind of it at school, you’ll probably remember one thing about history: how dull it can sometimes be. You might harbour painful memories of the Hundred Years’ War, the War of the Spanish Succession, crop rotation in the Middle Ages or – especially painful – the good deeds of Florence Nightingale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, it wouldn’t be surprising if – nowadays – you tended to steer well clear of the whole topic. But that would be a huge loss. The real reason why history is often so boring is that we’re not clear enough about what it should be for. Here is one big reason why history matters: it matters because it can provide us with solutions to many of the problems of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, history is there to introduce us to some of the things we need but that aren’t sufficiently visible in the world today. As a society, we’re obsessed by what we’re up to right now. Unknowingly, we’re hugely biased towards the present. The news – which is about the most prestigious force in the world today – circles obsessively around some of the things that have happened <b><i>in the last five minutes</i></b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1573" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/newspaper.jpg" alt="The Christian Science Monitor Archive" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, many of the most important things that we need to nourish, sustain and inspire us are a lot older. What we need above all else are good ideas in a range of areas that challenge us – and history is full of them. Imagine you’re dissatisfied with aspects of contemporary Capitalism. It might help hugely to read about the history of the Levellers, a group of English radicals writing and acting between 1645 and 1650. Or to learn about the medieval theory of ‘the just price’ when it comes to grasping the idea of ‘externalities’ in modern economics. Or if you question what the point of going on holiday is, you might dramatically enrich your thoughts by considering the history of pilgrimage, especially the motives which people had for trekking off to visit distant shrines. Or if you want to consider whether to get married, you should read the ideas of Mary Wollstonecraft from the 18th century or St Aquinas from the 13th century. There are so many ideas that have gone missing, wedged in the past, in volumes written long ago and not looked at in decades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1574" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1133px-DeathWatTylerFull.jpg" alt="1133px-DeathWatTylerFull" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us that things can change. People haven’t always been as they are now: materialistic and work-obsessed, unable to build nice architecture; over-concerned with being ‘connected’ or hung up on being absurdly thin. There’s an annoying saying that goes: ‘those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.’ But that suggests the only thing history is full of are mistakes. Yet it’s as fair to say: those who don’t know history won’t be able to improve the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1575" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rebellion.jpg" alt="Occupy Wall Street participants stage a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some people fall in love with periods of history, but a little too much. With a nostalgic passion. They can’t stop reading histories of World War II or of English country houses. You know the type. They’re responding to things that are missing from the present but seem not to quite know what to do about their lack. They want more Heroism and Grandeur. But they shouldn’t just be reading about it in the past, they should be using the past to figure out how a little more Heroism and Grandeur could enter life today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us courage. It’s easy to feel, when you’re pressed up against the present, that things are exceptionally awful right now. They rarely are, once you open the lens wide enough. The present is not unusual in its levels of mediocrity and compromise. Once you read the letters, the old guys were just as bad. And though our challenges are of course great, they aren’t exceptional – when compared with say, those facing the survivors of the Sack of Rome or the Lisbon earthquake.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4496" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024.jpg?resize=574%2C557" alt="Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History ends up as a tool for the appreciation of some of our present advantages which it’s easy to miss. It can teach us to judge our society against other societies rather than against our ideals. Of course the European Union has problems, but the Habsburg Empire had them and many more. Our governments are deeply imperfect, but there have been worse. Traffic is terrible, but so was the siege of Leningrad. History can console.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting clearer about what history is for should change how the subject is taught. In the future, we should treat history a little like a doctor treats a medicine cabinet. Before diving into history, we’d first have to work out what was wrong with us, what we were lacking in the here and now. We might be diagnosed for a lack of courage, or a spoilt nature or a hesitation about whether to marry. And we should be prescribed history accordingly. History as therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For their part, historians themselves should get clearer about what problems in the present they’re trying to solve. They should explicitly aim to tell us things about the past that can help us with issues of today. Not the past for its sake, but the past for our sakes. Good history should always mean: history with solutions or consolations for today.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In almost all countries and communities around the world, there is one central (usually unvoiced) suspicion that arises whenever someone lets slip that they are ‘having therapy’: they are crazy.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting therapeutic help should – ideally – be an ordinary and wholly unsurprising thing, like getting a haircut or going to the dentist, but it remains a very peculiar and frowned-upon recourse. Partly, that’s because the therapeutic industry currently looks deeply unimpressive. Some rather awkward people are employed in it, operating from shabby basement offices, often with dodgy credentials. A rag bag of questionable services gets labelled with this catch-all term. An industry that should be as dominant and financially significant as Audi or Nike struggles for basic recognition. There is plenty of good work being done, but it isn’t overly visible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2268" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/therapy.jpg" alt="Military Families Retreat Designed To Relieve Post-Combat Stress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, because we think of therapy as an emergency procedure, something you turn to because you have very big and alarming problems, we naturally prefer to see ourselves as not needing it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it is precisely therapy that may stop us from developing these desperate problems in the first place. ‘Seeing someone’ (as the euphemism goes) may be the strongest possible promise and indicator of sanity. It should be part of the everyday experience of everyone at large in the modern world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2269" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trains.jpg" alt="Internet Addiction" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few of the reasons why:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: A therapist can untangle our confused feelings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thinking about lives is hard, especially in the age of the internet. There’s always a news site (or a porn film) a few clicks away, ensuring that we’re able to avoid large challenging realisations about ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may know that our career needs to change, but it rarely seems a good time to analyse how and why. Or we may feel some resentment against our partner over certain upsetting incidents, but we avoid pinning down what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. We pay a big price for such self-ignorance: countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our inner confusions. We pick the wrong job; get together with a destructive person, run away from the right one; spend our money foolishly and don’t do justice to our deeper talents and aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because thinking about our lives is so hard, it helps immeasurably to think with someone else in the room, a skilled operator who can say: ‘go on… this sounds fascinating…’ – just as we were about to give up or evade an uncomfortable emotion. Their interest can sustain and guide our own; their commitment to making sense of what we’re saying and feeling gives us courage to walk further into the labyrinth of our psyches. They can do for us what no friend, however well-meaning, has the experience or patience to do: play us back to ourselves accurately, carefully and sanely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/puppet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4498" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/puppet.jpg?resize=600%2C416" alt="Paper Face" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Therapy helps us be less defensive</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our characters are heavily buttressed by what therapists call ‘defences’: strategies to prevent us from acknowledging painful but important emotions and desires.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We like someone a lot – but out of a fear they’ll reject us – act in an aloof and sarcastic manner. Or we are deeply ambitious financially, but are so afraid of trying and failing to start a business on our own, we take it out on an abstraction we bitterly call ‘capitalism’. Or we stay at work day and night, always complaining of how busy we are, because being at the office feels more reassuring than anywhere else, for reasons that elude us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therapy is a safe environment in which to discover more about the origins of our defences – and ideally to shed a few of them, so as to be able to lead more exposed yet more fulfilled lives. We pay too high a price for the apparent ‘safety’ of these defences: the cost of protecting ourselves in one area is always an incapacity in many others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensive behaviour requires therapy – rather than just a good dose of common sense – because we are sure to deny our manoeuvres if someone calls us on them in an overly direct way. It’s an arduous task marshalling our energies to address the most difficult aspects of our own behaviour. We keep on wanting to blame other people. Or run away. The therapist keeps us usefully tethered to the topic in hand, for as long as it might take for us to become a little more honest and braver with ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Therapy bolsters a sane inner voice</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the course of our lives, we will without doubt be exposed to a cast of terrible role models – and are at risk of internalising their unhelpful – but potent – approaches to life. The critical, snide remarks of a gang from school get lodged in our imaginations, so that we keep hearing echoes of their corrosive (but to us compelling) commentaries decades thereafter. Our harassed, rushed mother who couldn’t give us enough attention at key moments thirty-five years ago becomes our imaginary template of all intimate communication: people only half listen to one another, they always have more important things to do than spend time with us… Or it could be a splenetic father, who was never much impressed with us, from whom we internalise the idea that authority figures are always critically looking to see where we have fallen short.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2271" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tears.jpg" alt="People. Children. Boys. pic: 1940's. Three schoolboys in long socks, short trousers, blazers and caps &quot;poke fun&quot; at another boy's dress sense." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These punitive, debilitating voices push us towards unhelpful ways of interpreting our own experience. I am disgusting, we tell ourselves. In our minds, we hear: of course, I failed. Obviously that person wouldn’t be interested in me. I’ve got no chance. I’ve got to leave the living room spotless – only the worst possible people would ever leave things until the morning. Only a deranged person would want to think of that during sex…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key tasks of the therapist is to expose us often enough to a more sane, respectful, reasonable and realistic outlook than our own. The hope is that we will not for ever have to rely on their presence. A good version of the earlier damaging process of internalisation can ideally occur. The therapist’s kindly, wise voice should become our own. We should begin to intuit what they would have said in a given situation, and when they are no longer there, at moments of crisis and loneliness, can learn to say some of the important, calming and kind things to ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Therapy helps couples hear one another</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships can descend into shouting matches. Both parties are furious and out to wound, yet both are also too hurt to listen. In such chaotic situations, a therapist can become the wise broker, allowing each person to have their say, sympathising with both parties, while taking neither of their sides. Therapy becomes a safe diplomatic back channel, away from the open warfare of domestic life. The therapist can help the couple to see that behind one person’s rage is pain and a history of betrayal. Or she might make someone aware of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of hostile silence or controlling inquisitions. She can hold both parties back from one another’s throats for just long enough that they may start to understand what their previously caricatured opponent is going through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2273" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bonding.jpg" alt="Healthy Marriage Initiative Classes Held In Pennsylvania" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It could all seem far from romantic, but if by romantic one means committed to the development and growth of love, then there can be nothing more romantic than to pour over a couple’s resentments – before these have corroded all capacities for desire and tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from a self-indulgence, undergoing therapy is one of the most generous things we could ever do for all those who have to live around us. Those who have spent time in therapy are, if the process has worked even moderately well, ever so slightly less dangerous to be around: a little better able to warn those who depend on them of how frustrating and peculiar they might sometimes be. We owe it to ourselves, and just as importantly, those who love us, to take our courage in our hands – and to go and ‘see someone’ forthwith.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1785" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_2836998a.jpg" alt="Italy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this would seem to be an ideal solution, there are two big problems associated with taking pictures. Firstly, we’re likely to be so busy taking the pictures, we forget to look at the world whose beauty and interest prompted us to take a photograph in the first place. And secondly, because we feel the pictures are safely stored on our phones, we never get around to looking at them, so sure are we that we’ll get around to it one day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These problems would seem to be very much of today, a consequence of the tiny phones in our pockets. But they were noticed right at the beginning of the history of photography, when the average camera was the size of a grandfather clock. The first person to notice them was the English art critic, John Ruskin. He was a keen traveller who realised that most tourists make a dismal job of noticing or remembering the beautiful things they see. He argued that humans have an innate tendency to respond to beauty and desire to possess it, but that there are better and worse expressions of this desire. At worst, we get into buying souvenirs or taking photographs. But, in Ruskin’s eyes, there’s one thing we should do and that is attempt to draw the interesting things we see, irrespective of whether we happen to have any talent for doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/660px-Millais_Ruskin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4512" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/660px-Millais_Ruskin.jpg?resize=635%2C603" alt="660px-Millais_Ruskin" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Ruskin, John Everett Millais, 1853-54</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Before the invention of photography, people used to draw far more than they do today. It was an active necessity. But in the mid-19th century, photography killed drawing. It became something only ‘artists’ would ever do, so Ruskin – passionate promoter of drawing and enemy of the camera – spent four years on a campaign to get people sketching again. He wrote books, gave speeches and funded art schools, but he saw no paradox in stressing that his campaign had nothing to do with getting people to draw well: ‘A man is born an artist as a hippopotamus is born a hippopotamus; and you can no more make yourself one than you can make yourself a giraffe.’</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So if drawing had value even when it was practised by people with no talent, it was for Ruskin because drawing can teach us to see: to notice properly rather than gaze absentmindedly. In the process of recreating with our own hand what lies before our eyes, we naturally move from a position of observing beauty in a loose way to one where we acquire a deep understanding of its parts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ruskintreestudy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4513" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ruskintreestudy.jpg?resize=632%2C478" alt="ruskintreestudy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Study of Part of the Trees in Turner’s ‘Crossing the Brook’, John Ruskin, before 1872</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ruskin was very distressed by how seldom people notice details. He deplored the blindness and haste of modern tourists, especially those who prided themselves on covering Europe in a week by train (a service first offered by Thomas Cook in 1862): ‘No changing of place at a hundred miles an hour will make us one whit stronger, happier, or wiser. There was always more in the world than men could see, walked they ever so slowly; they will see it no better for going fast. The really precious things are thought and sight, not pace. It does a bullet no good to go fast; and a man, if he be truly a man, no harm to go slow; for his glory is not at all in going, but in being.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So he slowed things down and recommended we spend far longer looking at impressive things, even quite simple things. His own drawings showed the way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4516" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather1.jpg?resize=635%2C397" alt="644px-Study_of_a_Peacocks_Breast_Feather" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather, John Ruskin, 1875</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a measure of how accustomed we are to rushing that we would be thought unusual and perhaps dangerous if we stopped and stared at a place for as long as a sketcher would require to draw it. Ten minutes of acute concentration at least are needed to draw a tree; the prettiest tree rarely stops passers-by for longer than a minute.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Summing up what he had attempted to do in four years of teaching and writing manuals on drawing, Ruskin wrote (in a beautiful passage it’s worth quoting in full):</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘Let two persons go out for a walk; the one a good sketcher, the other having no taste of the kind. Let them go down a green lane. There will be a great difference in the scene as perceived by the two individuals. The one will see a lane and trees; he will perceive the trees to be green, though he will think nothing about it; he will see that the sun shines, and that it has a cheerful effect; and that’s all! But what will the sketcher see? His eye is accustomed to search into the cause of beauty, and penetrate the minutest parts of loveliness. He looks up, and observes how the showery and subdivided sunshine comes sprinkled down among the gleaming leaves overhead, till the air is filled with the emerald light. He will see here and there a bough emerging from the veil of leaves, he will see the jewel brightness of the emerald moss and the variegated and fantastic lichens, white and blue, purple and red, all mellowed and mingled into a single garment of beauty. Then come the cavernous trunks and the twisted roots that grasp with their snake-like coils at the steep bank, whose turfy slope is inlaid with flowers of a thousand dyes. Is not this worth seeing? Yet if you are not a sketcher you will pass along the green lane, and when you come home again, have nothing to say or to think about it, but that you went down such and such a lane.’</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1097" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/166424347.jpg" alt="Readers’ Favorite Dishes Celebrate The New Season" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the moment, food is highly prestigious. A vast amount of attention is paid to celebrity chefs, dietary advice, new restaurants and cooking shows. We have, it seems, become collectively obsessed with what we eat.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the question of what we <i>need</i> from food, other than just physical sustenance, is rarely taken up. The issue sounds a bit weird. And yet food is evidently not just ‘fuel’. It offers help with certain of our psychological needs. It has, if you like, therapeutic potential.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because every kind of food not only has nutritional value (the sort you’ll see on the label), it also carries with it what one might term a psychological value. The value emerges from its character. Every food hints at a personality, an orientation, a way of apprehending the world, who it would be if it was magically turned into a person. You could ascribe to it a gender, an outlook, a spirit, even a political dimension.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1099" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/492779505-1.jpg" alt="Typical house on the island of Alicudi" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take the lemon. Nutritionally-speaking, it has 29 calories per 100g, 2.8g dietary fibre, 2.5g of sugar and so on. But psychologically-speaking, it has also ‘ingredients’. It is a fruit that ‘speaks’ (quietly but eloquently) of such things as: the south, the sun, the upstanding and the hopeful, the morning and the simple. It suggests calls to action, it wants us to brace ourselves to take on what matters and focus on what we know we have to do. It is against sentimentality: it is brutally honest, but kind. Or take the hazelnut. Again, full of nutritional value, but at the same time a receptacle of such things as: autumnal briskness, maturity, soberness, self-sufficiency and an almost childlike neatness (like a 10-year-old who keeps his drawers tidy…).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4808297471.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4526" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4808297471.jpg?resize=635%2C514" alt="Botany - Trees - Betulaceae - Fruits of common Hazelnut (Corylus avellana). Illustration." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foods contain edible philosophies of life, to which we may be seeking to get close by doing that most direct and understandable of things: eating. We are ingesting physically, but also trying to take into our souls the psychological nutrients we intuit. We want food to bolster certain sides of our natures and compensate for certain weaknesses of spirit. That’s what makes eating more than just fuelling up and restoring the body, it’s also about rebalancing our misshapen souls.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want the foods we eat to help us become a little more as they are; we want to take on the avocado’s confident serenity, the figs’ ease with sensuality, the scallops dignified privacy, the asparagus’s resolute commitment to individuality. We invest in a steak out of a new commitment to vigour and courage, we turn to honey to lend weight to a desire to be more satisfied with simplicity. We might drink a whole glass of cold milk to put a wall between the present and a sexually dissolute past few days.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1101" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4789604811.jpg" alt="What's Cooking?" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s sum up what food does for us at a psychological level:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>1. Food rebalances us</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of us are a little unbalanced in some way. We’re too intellectual or too emotional, too masculine or too feminine, too calm or too excitable. The food we love is frequently something that compensates us for a lack: it counterbalances us. When we’re moved by a food, it may be because it contains a concentrated dose of qualities we need more of in our lives. Perhaps it’s full of the serenity we admire, but don’t have enough of (bircher muesli). Perhaps it’s got the tenderness we long for, but that our jobs and relationships are currently lacking (peaches). The food we call ‘tasty’ gives vital clues as to what is missing in our psyches not just our stomachs. It’s in the power of food to help us be more rounded versions of ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1104" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus1.jpg" alt="Edouard_Manet_Bunch_of_Asparagus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>2. Food reconnects us with important but currently elusive parts of ourselves</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are complex, layered beings. Not every part of us that matters is close to the surface at any time. We have too much history and so much going on, we lose sight of it. So one’s more playful side may get buried. Or the capacity to be awestruck and quietly, but deeply, moved by simple things may get neglected (but not destroyed) in the normal demands of daily life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1105" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/90766963.jpg" alt="Great Yarmouth, May 1966." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The intense evocative powers of certain foods makes them powerful conduits for helpful memories and associations. The right food can provide access to neglected psychological regions. It might be that one needs to eat fish and chips brought from a street stand to be linked, internally, to one’s eight-year-old self and to recover some of the freshness and thrill of existence one had at that point. Or we might need a particular kind of ham to take us back to an energy we knew in the South of Spain at the age of 28.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thanks to food, one can reconnect with crucial – but easily forgotten – epochs of one’s own intimate history.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>3. Food can help us to change our lives</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Foods are bearers of philosophies (be kinder, remember sweetness, learn courage…).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we are trying to change our lives (and we should quite often), food can play a role. Certainly we need to surround ourselves with other things, books which pull us in the right directions, friends, work, holiday destinations… But food has something to contribute to this effort at inner reformation as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1106" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/459563751.jpg" alt="VIENNA, VA, DECEMBER 20, 2013: Chili-crusted tilapia and cam co" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It isn’t simply a case of ‘going on a diet’, as if the only thing one ever needed to change about one’s life was how heavy one was. We might ask food to help us on a mission to lead a less cluttered life, or to connect more with others, or to be more engaged with one’s own country… How we eat backs up ambitions for how we’d like to be.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>4. Food can compensate for the decline of religion</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the benign functions of religion has been to provide ritual; to make us set a date to meet up with important ideas and experiences and – fascinatingly – these religious rituals often centre around foods carefully chosen because they symbolise certain of the virtues the religions want to highlight.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, Zen Buddhists were encouraged to remember the value of friendship over a cup of elaborately brewed and very slowly consumed tea. In the early years of Christianity, the faithful would gather to remember the Saviour over that noble yet vulnerable creature, the lamb. The Jews use unleavened bread and bitter horseradish to embed the courage the believers displayed on the flight from Egypt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The precise things religions want to tell us about how to lead our lives (with the help of food) may not necessarily be compelling at this moment. But the background idea; of using food to encourage you to think and feel in certain ways at certain points, remains highly useful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/686px-Gathering_of_the_Manna.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4523" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/686px-Gathering_of_the_Manna.jpg?resize=635%2C530" alt="686px-Gathering_of_the_Manna" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to find our own equivalents of these religiously-choreographed foods, the tea, lamb or horseradish. That is, we should locate values we find supremely important, and then connect them up with particular foods with which they have most sympathy – and then, lastly, regularly ingest them in a ritual way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For example, because in the long winters of Northern Europe, Korea and America it is so easy to lose sight of pagan virtues (the sun, the body, expansiveness, freedom, sensuality), an ideal modern secular ritual might call for regular celebrations centred around three foods in particular: the lemon, the papaya, and the olive – each of these guardians of values heavily under threat in downtown Frankfurt or Seoul at 4pm on a February afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>5. Cooking as a route to individuation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our own lives, it always starts with someone else giving us the food they think we’d like. They often get it wrong. For long periods, we’re eating stuff that doesn’t make us happy, that just keeps us going in the barest way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1111" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/108296388.jpg" alt="17th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards Food And Wine Tasting Event" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of becoming an ‘individual’, as opposed to merely existing, is learning how to arrange bits of the outer world around us in sympathy with our own internal worlds. Learning how to cook has a big role to play in this, for it betokens a commitment to aligning what goes in our bodies with our true beliefs and hopes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No longer are we merely fed by the world, and passively ingest whatever it serves up, we learn to define what we need and ensure we know ourselves how to secure it.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><b>6. Food is an act of communication</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not all of us are very good with words. We want to get ourselves across, but stumble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’d like to express gratitude to someone, or show them more complex parts of ourselves. We’d like them to know about our imagination, our dexterity, or our commitment to dignified simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But what it can be hard to express with words, one can get across via food at the table. Our penne with fresh basil may be an essay on the love we feel for someone, the grilled mushrooms may be a way to say, in the deepest sense, welcome home, the roast chicken may be a plea for greater harmony in the family, the mango sorbet served with squares of black chocolate externalises a vision of utopia. Like music, food is extraordinarily direct. It can say the important things without having to go through the bore of language.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/114112703.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4524" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/114112703.jpg?resize=635%2C658" alt="Book report for May 11" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You are – quite literally – in the middle of nowhere – and, unexpectedly, it’s helping. A lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How frantic we otherwise normally are. We live competitive crazed lives: we compare ourselves constantly to those who have more, are smarter, seem more organised, look younger…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are so many reasons to be frantic, and yet – as we know in our hearts – it is even more of a priority to keep an occasional appointment with someone we neglect in our normal madness – a deeper, quieter part of ourselves. We have intimations of it at night, on the motorway or in the grey stillness of the early morning. And we feel it strongly here, deep in Navajo land, on the Utah-Arizona border.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It seems everything we do matters so much but, here, we listen to a different, more humbling message: that everything we do and are is in truth meaningless – when considered from a sufficient distance, from the perspective of the timeless stones, the boundless vistas, the infinite heavens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To counter our tendencies to exaggerate and panic, we need only meditate on our utter insignificance when measured against aeons of time and space. It was two hundred million years ago that the Triassic seas retreated, and the land rose up to became a high desert plateau that wind and rain have slowly, ever so slowly eroded. Harder capstones gradually emerged, protecting the rock below, to form the slender pinnacles, or buttes, and wider mesas of Monument Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is baking hot here during the day. The air is thin. It is a place resolutely indifferent to our lives. Here one does not matter; it is obvious – in a quiet, not-unkind way that one’s life is a tiny thing. The desert provides a needed, strategic renewal of perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond the dramatic pillars of rock the empty, very slightly undulating table extends into infinity without any mark of mankind. A light haze builds at the horizon. Banks of distant cloud are touched with pink and gold as the sun starts to go down, the horizontal rays of the sun setting the upright bands of sandstone alight. The ego is loosened, forgets itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert rehearses in grand terms a lesson that ordinary life typically introduces viciously; that the universe is mightier than we are, that we are frail and temporary and have no alternative but to accept the limitations on our will; that we must bow to necessities greater than ourselves. This is the lesson written into the stones and the red sands. But so grandly is it written here that we can come away from the desert, not crushed, but inspired by what lies beyond us; privileged to be subject to such majestic necessities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have not only travelled to a place, we have heard the whispers, across an ochre wasteland, of a philosophy of wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">  </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5458468588_637c9e92db_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4540" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5458468588_637c9e92db_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="5458468588_637c9e92db_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the first day, it was difficult. You went into the corner shop just off the main Motomachi shopping street to buy a prepaid mobile card. You pointed at your phone, you pretended to make a call. It was useless. Mr Nishimura couldn’t understand you at all. You were hot and flustered (it was 86°F and pretty humid). You felt such an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It was eerily familiar: like the time at school you were supposed to make a speech and your mind went totally blank; the painful evenings at college when everybody else seemed to be heading off somewhere and you weren’t sure if you could ask to join in.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the years, at home, you have learned how to avoid many of the situations that you find so awkward (though other people appear to manage them without the slightest concern). Most of the time, you can work round the diffidence and fear of being the unwelcome focus of attention, what at certain moments you call your shyness. When something feels alien or in any way threatening your instinct is to retreat. You’d never ask a stranger for directions in the street; the idea of going up to a group of people you don’t know at a party is terrifying. But now you are beginning to tire of the downside of this survival tactic: the too high price it extracts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Japan everything is, to you, foreign. You of course can’t know what you are supposed to do. You are so far from being inconspicuous, it’s a joke. Shyness is in a way no longer even an option. You are already so far off the deep end.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So you go back to the shop. You make use of the ATM (which has an English language option). You buy some wasabi flavoured crisps and give the man a big smile. He grins back. You’re learning to be a little more confident.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are learning how to do something: you’re learning to overcome, not just work round, your shyness. A holiday that immerses you in a life entirely different to your normal routine is the ideal setting to exercise what is really a skill (though we tend to see it as a piece of good or bad luck). You didn’t book into a big chain hotel. You’ve rented an apartment near the wonderful Sankeien Gardens from a really nice guy called Kazutaka.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Today you bought a packet of Chokobi mini star-shaped chocolate biscuits. You made a joke about the rain. You said ‘ame desu’ – which you’d practiced after breakfast and hopefully means something like ‘it’s raining’  &#8211; and gestured drolly at your wet hair. Mr Nishimura beamed at you. It’s a deep corrective. Your uncle who was so hard to please was not normal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are strengthening a capacity you need back in the rest of your life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Utrecht-cafe.jpg" alt="Utrecht-cafe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">August is perfect for sitting outside at the Café de Zaak in the Korte Minrebroederstraat. The decent beers on tap, plus a generous bring-your-own-meal policy make this one of the nicest cafes in town.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If one’s honest, there are really some very intriguing locals here. Floris has just asked if you’d like a mushroom Bitterballen and Saartje is encouraging you to try the latest Pure Noodzaak. There’s someone you like the look of sitting by the window, reading a paperback by Marion Bloem. Maybe you could end up in their bed tonight. It’s not something you’d necessarily rush to tell your colleagues or your parents: but it’s true. Your unconscious knows it. You realise that without quite accepting the fact, you have come to Utrecht as a sex tourist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sex tourism sounds horribly sleazy, deeply pathetic and beyond the pale. We associate it (in its poshest guise) with a rich Western man, an uptight, over cerebral, metropolitan character, finding despicable release in the cheaper brothels of the third world. Sex tourism means self-indulgence and exploitation. No one can remotely deny that such things are vile. But to say that all sex abroad is always repugnant is to miss (for very understandable reasons) the more constructive possibilities which lurk in the vicinity of the term sex tourism: the possibility of getting closer to a nation and its virtues by sleeping with a local person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why would one even seek to do so? Because we are all inevitably a bit unbalanced. The course of life makes all of us excessively one thing or another; misanthropic or gregarious, competitive or too fearful of rivals, too focused on money or overly carefree… A search for the missing parts of ourselves – for the dispositions which will balance us and allow us to grow more complete – often feeds a desire to travel to a particular place. The uptight person may seek a Latin country. The slightly chaotic one feels drawn to the virtues of a northern Protestant land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands has developed a national talent for ambitious ordinariness. Dutch culture is very keen to stress human equality. Yet its image of what it is to be ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ is stylish and sophisticated. It’s ordinary to ride a bike wearing a big floppy hat and to take a peek at a poetry book by Herman Gorter at the lights. It’s ordinary to keep your house immaculately tidy. Liking Spinoza’s philosophy doesn’t feel more posh than supporting Ajax or Feyenoord. Psychologically, the Netherlands is the national home of a crucial, elusive combination: dignity and equality. We already have an intuitive sense that the Dutch (like so many other nations) can offer us something we need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real question is: how does one access it and make it one’s own?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our cultural traditions suggest we should visit museums. That’s always where we’re meant to go in order to sense and imbibe the national spirit; in order to be educated. But many of us wind up at the Rijksmuseum more from lack of imagination than any real interest in de Hooch or Van Ruysdael.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In truth, the virtues of the Netherlands are better found in the people, not in the art. But a chat over a beer might not be quite enough. There might be other, more committed places to explore national identity and virtue: in the bedroom. So what’s needed now (and what the Café de Zaak may provide, especially if one dares to say hello to someone soon) is the most potent educational force known to humankind: the brief affair abroad, in a country one deeply admires.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-935" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/873470920951df784b27b1.jpg" alt="873470920951df784b27b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been in the air for 12 hours. Now this anonymous box. It was your company’s idea. You’d have a chance to sleep a little, then catch the next 11 hour flight, before heading straight into the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been assigned a room at the top western corner of the building from which you can see one side of a terminal and a sequence of red and white lights that mark the end of a runway. Every minute, despite the best attempts of the glazing contractors, you hear the roar of an ascending jet, as hundreds of passengers, some perhaps holding their partners’ hands, others sanguinely scanning <i>The Economist</i>, head out over the Straits of Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re hungry and hunt out the room service menu. ‘Pacific snapper, enhanced with lemon pepper seasoning atop a chunky mango relish.’ The always dour ‘Chef’s soup of the day’. But perhaps, in the end, there’s never an alternative to the Club Sandwich, which you’ve never eaten anywhere but in places like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a knock at the door twenty minutes later. It is a strange moment when two adults meet each other, one naked save for a complimentary dressing gown, the other (newly arrived in Singapore from the little village of Ujung Batu in Indonesia and sharing a room with four others near the sports stadium), sporting a black and white uniform, with an apron and name badge. It is difficult to think of the ritual as entirely unremarkable, to say in a casually impatient voice, ‘By the television, please,’ while pretending to rearrange papers – though this capacity can be counted upon to evolve with more frequent attendance at global conferences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have dinner with Chloe Cho, formerly with CNBC, now working for Channel NewsAsia in Singapore. She updates you on the regional markets and Samsung’s quarterly forecast. You wonder what Chloe’s outside interests might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s impossible to get to sleep. The prehistoric part of your mind, trained to listen for and interpret every shriek in the trees, is still doing its work, latching on to the slamming of doors and the flushing of toilets in unknown precincts of the building. The sky is a chemical orange colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being unable to sleep night after night, for weeks on end, is – of course – hell. But in smaller doses, insomnia in a lonely foreign hotel does not need a cure. It’s an asset with some key troubles of the soul. Crucial things you need to think about get a chance to unfold here. During the day, back home, you are dutiful to others, you’re part of a team of thirty. The emails come in by the dozen every ten minutes. Here, for once, in this box at the end of a long corridor, you can return to a bigger duty: to yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hotel on the edge of the runway is a corrective to the demands of the community, to the inability to think in the normal press of the day. It’s like a monastery in the times of old. You can turn things over. The thoughts of this long night would sound weird to your partner, your friends, your children. These people need you to be a certain way. They cannot tolerate all your possibilities and desires – and for some good reasons. You don’t want to let them down; they have a right to benefit from your predictability. But their expectations choke off important aspects of who you are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, in this endless night by the airport, with the window open and a clearing sky above, it is just you, the universe and an A380 on its final approach from Dubai.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the rush of the day, there is no time for the higher-order questions: where is my career going? How come there is so little tenderness in my relationship? How could I reconnect with my kids? What do I really want from this brief life?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be turning over such issues and yet to feel like a mere beginner is worrying, but you go with it nevertheless. You’re taking notes on the hotel pad. You have the protection of the night and of a foreign land where no one knows of you or cares about you in the slightest. You could disappear here and hardly leave a trace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are naturally very inclined to want to be normal. Yet thanks to this insomnia, you are granted a crucial encounter with your weirder, truer self. The daytime-office you is a misleading picture of what you’re like. This insomnia is a gift, and this horrid lonely over-priced hotel its precious, unexpected guardian.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would be unusual today to find a travel agent recommending a sojourn in Detroit as the ideal vacation. The city is, after all, in decline. There are neighbourhoods full of derelict homes, there are shattered theatres and ruined office buildings that were thriving only a few decades ago.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the idea of going there is far from unreasonable. It has long been fashionable to visit ruins – but only of a very special kind. Announcing you are off on holiday to see what is left of ancient Ephesus, near Izmir on Turkey’s Aegean coast, will raise no eyebrows. We understand that contemplating the beautiful remains of the Library of Celsus can put one in touch with the instability of all human achievement. In its day, the Library at Ephesus must have seemed indestructible. Now we know what can happen to the finest long-term ambitions and the melancholy, bracing truth – hopefully – hits home. We become, in our own lives, more conscious that time is fleeting, that we must not count on the future, that we cannot count on endless good fortune. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But time dulls the power of the message. The idea that a civilisation lasted a mere seven hundred years before collapsing is not – if one is honest – a terribly disturbing thought. The thought that Piccadilly Circus might have only another 537 years to go, or that by 2714, Tate Modern will be buried under sand, does not freeze the soul or force a radical reassessment of life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why one should head for West Oakman Boulevard or East English Village to contemplate contemporary ruins. Less than ten years ago, these places were filled with hope and life; couples were excitedly choosing paint for the nursery; people were planting trees and upgrading their heating system; they were looking forward to the future. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You should perhaps attend an auction at which a house that would be greatly prized if it was located in Putney or Morningside is sold for a hundred dollars. It has, effectively, no financial value. It has fallen off the edge of the economic universe.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of such travel is not to make us downcast. It is, rather, to make us attend to the fragility of life. We do not know what five years will bring. The fascinating classical remains in Turkey elegantly preach a lesson about history. Detroit offers a crash course in short-term error. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BDP1DE.jpg" alt="Pumping station near Isla Mayor, Seville, Spain" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many guide books suggesting what you might do when you get to Seville. But they all pretty much agree that you must go both to the Plaza de España, built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, and then to the Alcázar – a beautiful Moorish fort which subsequently became a royal palace. There’s also the cathedral and the art museum. If you have extra time, you should go to the flamenco dance museum, visit the Torre del Oro by the river and stroll through the old streets of the Santa Cruz neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such lists are inadvertent but powerful agents of snobbery. The guide book is today’s equivalent of Debrett’s Peerage and Baronetage, which a smart person might have consulted in 1805 to identify who was worth visiting in Hampshire.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The list of locations to view carries within it a variety of assumptions about what makes something worthwhile: it should ideally be long-standing; it should have prestigious links to art, religion and royalty; and literary associations are always a plus (all visitors to Seville are strongly advised to see the monument to Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, located on the Plaza de América).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Snobbery exploits a natural frailty of our nature: an insecurity about deciding what matters to us, and an accompanying meek assumption that whatever is important or valuable must already have been discovered by others and have achieved widespread prestige. Snobbery emerges out of excessive loyalty to established status, whether laid down by Debrett’s or the apparently (but only apparently) more independent-minded TripAdvisor. Travel snobbery slyly assumes that only people or things which come with a particular kind of endorsement could have any importance for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We shouldn’t feel unusually stupid about this. It’s not an exceptional curse. We are all prone to snobbery, not in terms of seeking invitations to A-list parties, but in the wider and more important sense that we develop prejudices about where beauty, interest, intelligence and sensitivity are likely to turn up – based on the verdicts of certain established voices of authority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But as we travel, inside of us, we may register a lot of latent interests that aren’t mentioned in any tourist offices, yet that we might profitably take time to explore, if only we could overcome ‘guidebook guilt’. We might, for example, deep inside be far more curious about how local supermarkets operate than in the legacy of Cervantes. Or we might find ourselves thinking a lot more about local attitudes to cars than about Velázquez.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or imagine if in our hearts what we’re really struck by in Seville is the sheer dryness of the landscape and the challenges of pumping water into the city and its surrounding villages. What a feat of engineering must be going on in the background, just to ensure that our shower at the Hotel Don Paco sends out its comforting, powerful spray with such reliability twice a day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hydro engineering never appears in any guidebook, it just doesn’t fit assumptions about what deserves prestige (though in the 18th century, no visit to a city was complete without a tour of the waterworks). However, what pleasure we might experience if we courageously took a day off from the tyranny of museums and monuments and headed south, on the A8053, to the village of Isla Mayor – in order to visit the stunning nearby Salina Grande pumping station.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pumping station is on no must-see list. It has never been invited to a smart party.  But the gargantuan stark structure is a key part of a major irrigation system which has turned former marshland into rice fields. It hums modestly yet powerfully. There are 25 separate turbines inside, each made by the German engineering company Siemens, masterpieces of rational thought and discipline. If you get there early, you might see a Griffon vulture warming its wings on the parapet in the morning sun. There are a few large, isolated cork oak trees nearby. It’s a beautifully desolate place. It’s also, as much as a cathedral, an emblem of civilisation: a location where an intense, strategic intelligence has overcome the limitations of nature, harnessed the earth and brought fertility and sweetness to millions (it is because of the station that the famous Seville oranges can flourish). The station is moving in its lack of pride: it works mutely, unknown, through the night, across the parched summer days, making sure the groves will survive the arid months, guaranteeing that those tourists will have enough water for their showers when they return from the dusty Plaza de España.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might not be a pumping station that, in the end, does it for you. But all of us have equivalents. Things we care about that aren’t mentioned anywhere. Private interests that we don’t explore, simply because they aren’t generally spoken about, they don’t feel normal enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originality only begins when we dare to be thought a little mad, when we allow our curiosity to be spontaneous, when we undertake the heroic effort of worrying a little less what the crowd and the guidebooks will think. Part of growing up, and learning to travel well, means daring to take our own interests a bit more seriously.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/493651173.jpg" alt="COLOMBIA-ELECTION-SECURITY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Groups of young men armed with planks of wood roam the alleyways extorting money. Houses are made of bits of tin, old doors, the occasional lump of concrete, oil drums and tarpaulin sheets. Sofa carcasses thrown onto rubbish tips in the first world are covered in strips of office carpet. Open sewers, choked with filth, run between houses. People spend their days picking up refuse in a gigantic dump. This is Comuna 13 in the San Javier district of Medellín (the second-largest city in Colombia): an ideal holiday destination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, successful young men went on Grand Tours to complete their education.  They travelled to Venice, Florence, Rome and Naples and looked at pictures and statues from the Renaissance and the Ancient World. Their journeys were based on an idea that what their participants most lacked, and might most severely be undermined by lacking, was high culture. They had to undertake such journeys – they needed to know about Titian and Veronese and key moments in Roman history – in order to become fully human. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This distinctive theory has had a huge impact. It explains why, at most times of year, the Uffizi in Florence and the Villa Borghese in Rome are packed. We remain the heirs of the notion that high culture is necessary to complete us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are, in truth, a great many other things we may lack as badly. Most of us are continually disenchanted with our circumstances. It seems impossible not to keep thinking about the people one envies, the ones who made it big. Our countries appear to be intolerably badly managed, dispiriting and coarse. The new supermarkets are unsightly and there’s nothing uplifting on television. There seems so little to be grateful for from day-to-day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is why we need, perhaps more urgently than we need to go to Florence, to take a trip to Comuna 13. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course we know, in theory, that we’re lucky, all of us in the first world; we’ve known it ever since we were intimidated into finishing what was on our plates by tales of malnourished children in foreign lands. But it’s really only when one spends one’s first night in Comuna 13 that the truth starts to sink in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are no street lamps. Girls of 12 are selling themselves on street corners. The police will rob and possibly rape you. Guns go off hourly. If there is a fire, no fire engines can get to the scene; everything is burned. A gash on the leg from a ragged piece of metal or a sliver of broken glass can prove fatal. Your food has shit in it. If you are seriously ill; you die. A luxury would be a biro, some toothpaste, a clean sheet, a door with a lock.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comuna 13 is an education in appreciation. Like many great art works in elegant galleries, it teaches us to see – and admire &#8211;  things we have scarcely noticed before – except it does it with rather more conviction and lasting impact than a work by Vermeer or Jasper Johns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An 18th-century aristocrat would typically bring home a painting or a statue as a memento of their Grand Tour. They would put it in a prominent place at home: above the fireplace or in the hallway, so that they would see it everyday and so that the lessons of the trip would be kept fresh. Today, on returning from a week’s stay in Comuna 13, one might keep a bit of corrugated iron or a photo of the rain flooding straight through the roof of Eliana and Camilo’s one-room home, soaking them and their three young children to the bone</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/birmingham4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4542" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/birmingham4.jpg?resize=635%2C330" alt="birmingham4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Abroad is, as we know, the exciting bit. You’ve been so far recently. You were in Abuja only on Tuesday and then at Heathrow on Wednesday. Yesterday lunchtime, you were having fried plantain in the Wuse district with Promise and Chinwe, and at eight this morning, the captain closed down the 777′s twin engines at a gate in Terminal 5 across from a branch of Costa Coffee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re back home in Birmingham now. Midway down Glenpark Road, around the corner from West End Park. How peculiar and depressing everything looks against the memory of dawn in the Obudu hills. How sad the dampness of the English climate after the intense West African light. How drearily English, in a way they will never know, the chat of the neighbours out in the road when you have the din of the street market in Kubwa still ringing in your ears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why does ‘home’ so often have to be the boring bit? Seated together on most planes is a mixture of people with such different expectations of where they are going: those for whom this will be the start of a journey to a new land, and those returning home. The first group is filled with excitement, they have guidebooks, cameras and knots of anticipation. The second may be too sad to touch their inflight trays. On the final descent, they gaze at the landscape with melancholy faces. They have only home to contemplate, with its banal associations. And yet the two groups are travelling to the very same place. Once they have crossed customs, they will have before them the very same monuments, museums, landscapes and foods.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we accord such privileges to foreign places, and such ready disdain for our own lands? Would it not be one of the greatest skills, the most helpful kind of practical wisdom, to know how to sample a little of the excitement about our own countries that foreigners know how to locate here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The interest we take in where we are depends so much on prejudice; on whether we feel it’s acceptable or just plain possible to be interested. Receptivity or openness might be the chief characteristic of the traveller’s mindset. We approach new places with curiosity. We don’t assume we know anything. We stand on traffic islands and in narrow streets, gawping at and admiring what the locals take to be strange small details. We risk getting run over because we are intrigued by the roof of a government building or an inscription on a wall. We find a supermarket or hairdresser unusually fascinating. We dwell at length on the layout of a menu or the clothes of the presenters on the evening news. We are alive to the layers of a country’s history beneath the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At home on the other hand, we assume we’ve discovered most of what is interesting about the neighbourhood, simply by virtue of having lived there a long time. It seems so hard to imagine that there could be something novel to unearth in a place where we’ve spent our daily lives over many decades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But imagine how much one might notice if one walked out of the front door, and imagined one had never seen any of it before, if one pictured oneself as a foreigner from a far off land newly disembarked off a long-haul flight. One might be fascinated by the milky green of the trees, and the endless procession of leaden clouds. One might note the ordered sterility of the supermarket, the diffident politeness of people on the bus, the native genius for skirting conflict with a particular kind of irony. In a glass-fronted office block on Washwood Heath Road, one might spot some people gesticulating in a boardroom on the first floor and wonder at the workings of the distinctive Capitalism that grows here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The German philosopher Nietzsche expanded on the contrast: ‘When we observe how some people know how to manage their experiences – their insignificant, everyday experiences – so that they become an arable soil that bears fruit three times a year, while others – and how many there are! – are driven through surging waves of destiny, the most multifarious currents of the times and the nations, and yet always remain on top, bobbing like a cork, then we are in the end tempted to divide mankind into a minority (a minimality) of those who know how to make much of little, and a majority of those who know how to make little of much.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We meet people who have crossed deserts, floated on ice-caps and cut their way through jungles – and yet in whose hearts we would search in vain for evidence of what they have witnessed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the limits on how much we are able to travel (and its costs and side-effects), we should endeavour to try, before taking off for distant hemispheres, to notice what we have already so often seen closer at hand. And when we despair at coming back, we should be goaded on by the thought that ‘boring home’ is always someone else’s deeply exciting ‘abroad’.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Next time you’re at Heathrow, worn down by the queues, corridors and bright lights, your spirits may briefly lift at the sight of a discreet island of beauty standing at the end of a pier in Terminal 3. It’s the airport’s control tower, designed by Richard Rogers Partnership, built for £50m, eighty-seven metres tall, the most advanced tower in Europe – and the replacement for a sombre and hideous 1955 tower near Terminal 1, which was decommissioned because it wasn’t tall enough to offer views over the new Terminal 5.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1834" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowA.jpg" alt="Control Tower Heathrow Airport, London, United Kingdom, 2007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We aren’t very good at celebrating this sort of achievement. An ingrained artistic bias and technological pessimism continues to direct our admiration away from towers filled with banks of steadily breathing computers blinking their ruby red lights. It’s really only terrorists who get the measure of the wonders of our civilisation – however perversely they choose to respond to them by attempting to blow them up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet there is much to be admired in Heathrow’s tower, which looks like a giant eye or brain on a stick, tethered to its spot by massive steel cables bolted to blocks of concrete. Though one might have expected that the vital functions of an airport could by now all be relocated to a subterranean chamber, seeing the whole airfield from a single vantage point with your own eyes remains a surprisingly critical part of operations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1835" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowB.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Heathrow had a monarch, he or she would set up a throne in this tower. Like the London Eye or Parliament Hill, the control tower is inherently pleasing because it grants us command over a landscape that at ground level is at risk of seeming unfathomably complex. From this height, even Heathrow starts to feel manageable, like a board game whose instructions one might pick up after a few rounds. The traumas and humiliations we experience passing through the airport emerge as mere sideshows in a far more noble central drama: the safe ascent and descent of vast aircraft along two implausibly long runways stained tar-black by rubber and oil. We’re reminded that there is more to flying than air miles and lounges, that it is still a sublime and heroic matter to pit oneself against gravity in an aluminium tube.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From here, we can contemplate the airport aesthetically, without the need to remember the armies of harried passengers wheeling their laptops along lino concourses, the covetous atmosphere of the duty free shops or the boredom and jet lag of the seating areas. Though it’s in the centre of one of the busiest airfields in the world, the tower is almost silent, insulated behind panes of 25mm glass, which reduce even the roar of a fully laden Air New Zealand 747-400, taking off to Auckland via Los Angeles, to a murmur. The quiet of the tower resembles nothing so much as the rooftop cocktail bar of an exclusive downtown skyscraper hotel, all leather and whispers, an atmosphere of plush serenity reinforced by the provision of a deep pile carpet and a wash of soft blue light emanating from recessed LEDs in the banisters and handrails.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It takes a professionally very contented person not to entertain at least a brief wish to give up on the ordinary mundane occupations of existence at ground-level in order to join the ranks of these privileged airport midwives, trained to fit their restless or exhausted charges carefully into their berths. Across the airfield, planes are on the move. Wide-bodied jets, from whose windows the whole world can seem like a miniature, now themselves look like an offering from Mattel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1836" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowC.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is an office like no other. There isn’t banter or horseplay here, for there are few jobs so serious that a second of distraction can lead to a thousand deaths. In the olden days, a plane might come in every quarter of an hour. Now it’s a matter of less than a minute between aircrafts. One imagines that the office Christmas party of these sky gazers will be a sober, precise affair (perhaps livened up by the odd paper napkin folded and sent flying over the table by the office wit). The engineers who designed the tower were paid to think the darkest thoughts – and then make sure their building could resist them. There is everything in double or more here – and short of a direct strike from a jet, the tower will endure long after the more delicate terminals which it serves have fallen into ruin. Six cables support the building against cross-winds when three would easily do; there are lifts as well as stairs up the central core and four independent power sources are available to run the equipment. The architecture is in the recognisable, colourful high tech style of the Richard Rogers partnership: the lift panels are yellow, there’s a band of red beneath the control capsule and the cabling and ducts are exposed on the lower floors. Whereas such traits might appear mannered and indulgent in buildings with less stringent technological requirements (city offices or private homes), here one feels that it is the purpose of the tower itself which has necessitated them – and so they have an aura of concentrated seriousness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1837" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowD.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tower is wilfully undramatic about its achievements. Like so many bits of modern technology, it resists our curiosity. Few members of the public will ever be allowed to visit it. And yet it deserves to be recognised as one of the more awe-inspiring of contemporary achievements, in its own way a work of culture as complete as any artistic creation. So long as all goes well, most travellers through Heathrow will never have to think about the controllers. But when we pass through the airport, we should spare a moment to reflect that our journey was seemingly normal only because of some very abnormal processes and disciplines at work high in that elegant brain on a stick tethered to the ground in a ragged corner of Terminal 3.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Australia’s Western Desert covers some 600,000 square kilometres of the continent, stretching from the Nullarbor plain in the south to the Kimberley in the north, and from the Percival Lakes in the west through to the Pintupi lands in the Northern Territory. The terrain is vast, deeply opposed to life, filled with dangers – and a supreme aide to mental health.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert has never uttered a word, has never written anything down, has no mind or thought, and yet can be counted as one of the most philosophical entities on earth, always on hand, either practically or as a concept in our minds, to bring perspective back to our otherwise chaotic, harassed lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1857" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270314-desertA.jpg" alt="Sunset over Uluru, in the red desert of Australia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is usually unpleasant to be made to feel small by more successful peers and colleagues. But there are other far more satisfying ways to feel diminished. In the Great Sandy Desert regions, one sees gashes and fissures in the rocks that speak of disproportionate expanses of time. The earth’s tectonic plates have here rippled granite as though it were linen and spread it out in seeming infinity on a horizon, which eventually gives way to the featureless, baking plains of the Tanami desert. There is relief in contemplating rocks created four hundred million years ago; and the erosion of millennia marked on the walls of steep canyons. In the face of the strength, age and size of the universe, humans seem merely dust postponed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why the pleasure? Why might we seek out this feeling of smallness – and delight in it and recover balance through it? Because we naturally exaggerate our own importance. The incidents of our own lives loom very large in our view of the world. Yet, as the Australian Western Desert teaches us, we are minute and entirely dispensable in the greater scheme of things. The world will go on much the same without us, which can be a source of relief rather than distress. It is very helpful to be reduced, from time to time, in our own eyes, because this calms the urgent, disturbing (and very normal) sense that it matters so much what we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1858" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270314-desertB.jpg" alt="The Olgas, Central Australia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need hints of the unimaginable extensions of space across the solar system, the galaxy, the cosmos. The sky at night from the desert is lit up with the sparkles of a million stars. Gazing up, none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes seem to have any relevance. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, will be of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. For a little while our own lives can seem blissfully unimportant. But it is not a personal affront. The same applies to everyone: it is levelling, humbling and a deep relief.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert rehearses in grand terms a lesson that ordinary life typically introduces viciously; that the universe is mightier than we are, that we are frail and temporary and have no alternative but to accept the limitations on our will; that we must bow to necessities greater than ourselves. This is the lesson written into the stones and the red sand. So grandly is it written there that we may come away from the desert, not crushed, but inspired by what lies beyond us; privileged to be subjects to such majestic necessities. We are the playthings of the forces that laid out those canyons and chiselled those barren mountains. The desert moves us to acknowledge limitations that we would otherwise encounter with anxiety or anger in the ordinary flow of events. It is not just nature that defies us. Human life is as overwhelming, but it is the vast spaces of nature that perhaps provide us with the finest, the most respectful reminder of all that exceeds us. If we spend time in them, they may help us to accept more graciously the great unfathomable events that molest our lives and will return us to dust.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There can be few websites more delightful than <a href="http://airlinemeals.net/" target="_blank">Airlinemeals.net</a>. It’s a site sure to be of interest to future anthropologists and that should already now be of interest to poets – because it is entirely dedicated to photographs of airline meals, which have been uploaded by passengers for no particular reason besides the sheer enjoyment of showing off and looking at food on trays in planes around the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1883" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsA.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can compare the cutlery on Swiss and Lufthansa, study what you’d get in ANA economy, admire the fluted glasses on TAP First Class and commiserate with anyone on Delta travelling across the Pacific between LAX and Sydney with only two pizzas and a roll for sustenance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1894" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsB-1.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Naturally airline food is dismal when we compare it to what we’d get on the ground but this is to miss the point of its charm. The thrill lies in the interaction between the meal and the dramatic, inhospitable place in which one is eating it. Food that, if eaten in a kitchen, would have been banal or offensive, acquires a new taste and interest in the presence of the clouds – like a picnic of bread and cheese that delights us when eaten on a clifftop above a pounding sea. With the in-flight tray, we make ourselves at home in an unhomely place: we appropriate the extraterrestrial skyscape with the help of a chilled bread roll and a plastic tray of potato salad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1886" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsC.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To eat in odd outdoor places is to express a rare security and confidence. No longer do we have to huddle in a kitchen defensively, away from predators; now the whole world can be one’s dining room and a surge of confidence accompanies this recognition. One is laying one’s metaphorical picnic blanket over a vast terrain; the mountains of Arizona will be the setting for the starter, one will pick through an endive salad over the Utah desert and might move on to a chocolate sauce over the foothills of the Rockies. Out of the window is a sight that would have seemed earth-shattering to Michelangelo or Turner, though few people will ever bother to notice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1896" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsD1.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the airline industry, there has long been a discrepancy between how seriously carriers try to distract their passengers and how uninterested they are in trying to help them marvel at the technological and aesthetic phenomena around them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Things are no less interesting on the ground, in the places where the meals are assembled. While the terminals are filled with TV screens showing CNN (rarely does the world seem a more boring, homogenous place than when seen through the eyes of this dismal channel), only a few metres away, in anonymous chilled warehouses, beautiful frenzied logistical efforts will be unfolding. Thousands of breakfasts, lunches and dinners, all intended for ingestion within the following few hours somewhere in the troposphere, are being prepared: Korean Airlines is serving beef broth, JAL salmon teriyaki and Air France a chicken escalope on a bed of pureed carrots. Foods that will later be segregated by airline now mingle freely together, much like passengers in the terminal, so that a tray containing a thousand plates of Dubai-bound Emirates hummus may be lined up in the freezer room next to four trolleys full of SAS gravadlax, set to fly part way to Stockholm.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Airplane food fascinates because it stands at a point of maximum tension between the manmade and the natural, the technological and the organic. Even the most anaemic tomato (and so many on board are mesmerising in their fibrous pallor) remains a work of nature. How odd, then, that we should take our fruit, meat and vegetables up into the sky with us, when we used to sit more humbly at nature’s feet, hosting harvest festivals to honour the year’s wheat crop and sacrificing animals to ensure the continued fecundity of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The interest continues to the menus. There can be few literary works in any language as poetic as these documents:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The autumn blast</span></p>
<p class="p2">Blows along the stones</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Mount Asama</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lines composed by Matsuo Basho, the Japanese poet who brought the haiku form to its mature perfection in the Edo era. But how unevocative this is next to the verse of the poet at work somewhere within Air Canada’s catering operation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1890" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsF.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the eternal ambitions of art is to renew our love of things that get too easily taken for granted. <a href="http://airlinemeals.net/" target="_blank">Airlinemeals.net</a> is a major home of art in our time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">People look at one strangely if one makes a trip to the zoo without a child. Ideally one should have a gang of children, evidence of dribbled ice-cream and some balloons as well. Contemplating enclosures with oriental small-clawed otters or leopard geckos hardly seems an adult way to pass the afternoon. The elegant question in London at the moment is whether one has caught the German Renaissance show at the National Gallery, not the impressive new pygmy hippo at Regent’s Park Zoo.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4501" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooA.jpg?resize=635%2C540" alt="Zsl London Zoo's New A2.3 Million Children's Zoo - Animal Adventure - Is Designed To Get Children As Young As Three Interested In Animals. Sam Sherwood Age 5 From The Gower Primary School Islington Gets To Watch A Meerkat From Inside A Perspex Bubb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if one’s five year old nephew pulls out at the last minute (he’d remembered it was his best friend’s birthday), then one might stubbornly decide to go through with an afternoon at the zoo any way. The first simple thought is how strange animals look. Apart from the odd cat, dog or horse, it may be years since one has seen a real animal, an extraordinary, jungle-bookish sort of creature. Take the camel: a u-shaped neck, two furry pyramids, eyelashes that seem coated in mascara, and a set of yellow buck teeth. There is a guide on hand with some facts: camels can go ten days in the desert without drinking, their humps aren’t filled with water, it’s fat, the eyelashes are designed to keep out sandstorms, and their liver and kidneys extract all moisture from food, leaving their dung dry and compact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooB.jpg" alt="London Zoo annual stocktake, London, Britain - 04 Jan 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If creatures end up looking so strange, it’s all because of their adaptations to the peculiarities of the natural environment, Darwin taught us, and no one would doubt it in Regent’s Park. The Sri Lankan Sloth bear has long, mobile lips and two missing upper incisors so that it can suck ants and termites out of their nests, a distinctive facial feature which no one who relied on a more conventional diet would have bothered with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every creature seems wonderfully adapted for some things, hopelessly suited for others. The horseshoe crab looks monstrous, like a miniature military helmet with bow legs, but it’s a pro at surviving in deep water and avoiding the appetites of sharks. It lives quietly, without incident, sliding only occasionally across the ocean floor to grab the odd mollusc.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1904" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooC.jpg" alt="Zsl London Zoo's New A2.3 Million Children's Zoo - Animal Adventure - Is Designed To Get Children As Young As Three Interested In Animals. Sam Sherwood Age 5 And Lottie Kendall Age 5 Watches The Porcupines At The Animal Adventure Experience At Lond" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard not to land on particular creatures in which one sees aspects of one’s own character. In his letters, Gustave Flaubert compared himself variously to a boa constrictor (1841), an oyster in its shell (1845), and a hedgehog rolling up to protect itself (1853, 1857). One might come away identifying with the Malayan tapir, the baby okapi, the llama and the turtle (especially on sombre Sunday evenings).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1905" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooD.jpg" alt="Zsl London Zoo. The Penguins At London Zoo. 4 Penguins Have Reportedly Died After Catching A Deadly Strain Of Malaria. There Was No Sign Of Any Ill Looking Penguins At Feeding And None Of The Staff Mentioned Anything About The Disease." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A zoo unsettles in simultaneously making animals seem more human and humans more animal. “Apes are man’s closest relative,” reads a characteristically chirpy caption by the orang-outang enclosure, “how many similarities can you see?” Far too many for comfort, of course. Shave him, dress him in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, and the one scratching his nose in the corner of the cage might be a cousin. In May 1842, Queen Victoria visited Regent’s Park Zoo, and in her diary, noted of a new Orang Outang from Calcutta: “He is wonderful, preparing and drinking his tea, but he is painfully and disagreeably human.” How easily one can imagine being captured and placed in a cage-like room in a Holiday Inn, with three meals a day passed through a hatch, and with nothing to do other than watch TV – while a crowd of giraffes look on at one, giggling and videoing, licking confectionery, while saying what a short neck one has.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4500" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooE.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Zsl London Zoo Conduct Their Annual Weigh-in Where All The Zoo's Animals Are Measured And Weighed. The Giraffes Masure Up Against The Wall Chart." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outside the zoo, so much of what one does starts to assume animal-like tendencies. Calling up that friend for a drink; just part of the mating ritual of the species, not fundamentally different from what llamas are up to when they start to whistle strangely at each other on long autumn nights on the Peruvian plains.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then again, there is relief to be found in the ability to view one’s antics as manifestations of basic animal drives; for food, shelter and survival of one’s genetic offspring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should never wait for the excuse of a child to go to the zoo.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Having a decent conversation is something most of us imagine we can do without any problem – and certainly without much thought. These things just happen naturally. Don’t they?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, truly good conversations come along very rarely; largely because our societies fall for the Romantic myth that knowing how to talk to other people is something we are born knowing how to do, rather than an art dependent on a little planning and a few skills. We rightly accept that total improvisation in preparing a meal is unlikely to yield good outcomes; but we show no such caution or modesty when it comes to how we might talk over the food once it has been made. Finding oneself in a good conversation can feel as haphazard and random as stumbling on a beautiful square in a foreign city at night ­– and realising one won’t reliably know how to get back there in daytime.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2336" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/483000331.jpg" alt="New York Culinary Experience Private Dinner Featuring Chefs David Bouley, Daniel Rose, And David Waltuck Hosted By New York Magazine Culinary Editor Gillian Duffy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for better conversations should begin with the question of what a conversation is ideally for. And here two basic functions suggest themselves: confirmation and clarification.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The official story of what life is like leaves out a daunting amount about who we really are. Too much of what we feel can’t normally be disclosed for fear that we’ll be humiliated or cause undue alarm or upset. Our envy of colleagues, our disappointments in love, our true feelings towards our families, our embarrassing habits and petty fears, our wilder political daydreams… little of this ‘silent normality’ has the chance to be discussed; until we find ourselves in a good conversation, by which is meant a conversation that – artfully, without prurience or judgement – manages to confirm the fundamental acceptability of hitherto carefully guarded emotions and ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28645111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4503" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28645111.jpg?resize=635%2C547" alt="Peeping Tom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Shyness takes a lot of the blame for poor conversations. We get scared of opening our souls because we falsely exaggerate the difference between ourselves and others. We display only our strengths, vaunt only our successes, lay out only our conventional proposals – and bore others as a result because it is in the revelation of our weaknesses, in the display of our fragilities, in the confession of our wilder fantasies that we grow interesting and likeable. It is almost impossible to be bored when a person tells you sincerely what they have failed at or who has humiliated them, what they long for and when they have been at their craziest.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2340" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3333684.jpg" alt="London Coffee Bar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then come the pleasures of clarification, conversations in which another person sharpens our ideas by correcting our tendencies to mental blankness and distraction. Thinking alone is hard, our minds jump away from the pressure to bring ideas into focus, preferring the charm of daydreaming or the internet instead. How helpful, therefore, to be able to embark on the job of thinking with someone who can hold us to the issues we need to refine, lend us courage to keep going with our hesitant opening thoughts and pollinate our analyses with their insights.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In too many countries, a misplaced fear of ‘pretension’ holds people back from raising the large rewarding topics – as though only very special people had the right to consider head on what it really means to be human. But is permission necessary to probe at the central assumptions of human life? When else are we meant to ask: What is the point of work? What makes a good relationship? How are we to raise children? What should we travel for? What should our nations be?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be braver and more demanding about the conversations we fall into. Rather than seeing successful examples as a gift, we should strive to become their regular engineers and cultivators.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s one of the nicest aspects of Zen Buddhist art that, for hundreds of years, its most distinguished artists spent their time writing things down. They didn’t paint or draw, they just inscribed some very important things on outsize scrolls with exceptional artistry and beauty, so that these words might be hung on the wall and catch our eye at key moments in domestic and business life. The artists expressed things they felt we should all remember but that we too often forget, simple exhortations like: ‘Forgive those who insult you – for they are hurt rather than bad,’ ‘Before blaming, ask if they have eaten and slept well,’ ‘You are not as unusual, or as shameful, as you think.’</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2472" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wallhanging.jpg" alt="wallhanging" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a fascinating and neglected idea: making bits of philosophical wisdom into works of art in themselves. But this way of presenting words is sympathetic to a very basic human frailty. We forget key things. At the humblest level, the shopping list had to be invented because we have a tendency to overlook half the requirements of the larder when at the store. We likewise forget a great many pieces of emotional wisdom that are in our minds in theory, but that we overlook in practice. The wise, consoling, encouraging, or cautionary words are simply not there when we need them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By making words physically beautiful – through the elegance of the script and the soothing texture and proportions of the paper – a Zen scroll becomes a piece of decoration that helps wisdom become a part of us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The world isn’t short of wisdom: it’s short of inventive techniques for making the wisdom we do have more prominent, and more readily available to us at moments of crisis.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Miranda Kerr is pretty, successful and very rich. She’s been named the sexiest woman alive. She’s also deeply interested in developing her mind. That means she’s into yoga, chanting, meditation and Japanese Buddhism. She recites Nam Myoho Renge Kyo twice a day – invoking the mystic law of the lotus flower which asserts that Miranda and the cosmos are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-250314-kerrA.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4505" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-250314-kerrA.png?resize=455%2C408" alt="PM-250314-kerrA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kerr has had some real difficulties with loneliness and loss. Her first boyfriend died in a car crash. A later lover turned out to be a crook. She married Orlando Bloom but it all fell apart pretty quickly. Her needs are real. And she’s turned for comfort and help to the East.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might have looked elsewhere. She might have found that Plato or Tolstoy had things to teach her. Maybe she could have been touched by Bach or medieval architecture. It’s not as if the West doesn’t also have a deep and long engagement with the sorrows of life. But, like so many spiritually curious people, she didn’t end up engaging with its culture. Instead she joined the Soka Gakkai Buddhist movement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda is deeply sincere in her longing to be educated and instructed. She’s a tireless advocate of an analysed life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how has it happened that Western culture largely passed Miranda by? It’s not her fault. She needed something and the West wouldn’t give it to her. So she went elsewhere. And her decision tells us something hugely important about how the Western world handles – or more accurately, mishandles – its culture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2059" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrB.jpg?resize=601%2C367" alt="PM-250314-kerrB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The philosophers at Sydney University have priorities beyond Miranda Kerr&#8217;s inner life &#8211; sadly.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda was bothered that her life felt empty and pointless. But in her home town of Sydney, all the professors in the university’s humanities department were busy with other things. For example, the philosophy department (a natural place one might go to in search of wisdom and consolation) was trying to define ontological naturalism, situate Wittgenstein in his proper historical perspective, footnote a volume of late Heidegger and compare Plato’s Phaedrus with Aristotle’s Ethics. It’s not a bad way to spend the time, but it isn’t – arguably – very helpful to anyone with anything resembling a real problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, Sydney University is not unusual. It’s the same from New Zealand to New Mexico. Academic institutions have turned culture – which should help us to live and die well – into abstract scholarship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buddhist sects are not like this. They’re on a mission to help you to find your way through the challenges of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2060" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg?resize=507%2C339" alt="200364690-008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re into Buddhism too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda is not alone by any means. It would be extremely strange to hear at a middle-class dinner party that the person next to you had found solace in Hegel or Aristotle. And totally unsurprising to learn that they had been to Nepal and were entranced by its traditional wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda was ready for guidance. She wanted someone to explain what you need to do to steer a path through life. And, because of certain deep prejudices against the idea of being useful, Western culture let her down.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2062" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrD.jpg" alt="PM-250314-kerrD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, for example, is ‘star’ academic philosopher Derek Parfit in action: “An act is wrong if and only if, or just when, such acts are disallowed by some principle that is one of the principles whose being universal laws would make things go best, one of the only principles whose being universal laws everyone could rationally will… or a principle that no one could reasonably reject.” One has to be ready for this, and many &#8211; indeed most &#8211; are not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda’s rejection of the West is the West’s fault. She needed help and none was given. This isn’t just a problem for one very famous model, it’s a problem for all of us, in the East and in the West. We are missing out on a crucial resource. The great figures of Western culture almost all wanted culture to function as an instrument for the pursuit of a wiser life: Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Schiller, Tolstoy, Proust… all wanted culture to be not an object of academic study, but a living resource that could offer counsel and direction (for when a boyfriend had been killed) – much as the Eastern ‘wisdom tradition’ has always believed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s time to return Western culture to its rightful ambitions, not in order to win out over the East, but in order to stand as its legitimate equal in the pursuit of a path to human flourishing.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">At a recent Sotheby’s auction in London, Wall by the German painter Gerhard Richter eclipsed the already vast estimate given by the auction house, finally selling for a shade under 17.5 million GBP. It confirms Richter’s place, in financial terms, at the very top of the the league of living artists. Generally, such news is transmitted with a degree of excitement and approval. It seems a sign of cultural health. Actually it shows we just don’t know what we want from art.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-sothebyA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4518" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190214-sothebyA.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="PM-190214-sothebyA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not that there is anything wrong with the painting. It’s moving and tender. It’s a big square of red, through which streaks of blue and black and lilac tentatively emerge, as if a crucial message was straining to be heard. But not quite making it to the surface. At key moments in our lives, we might feel as if we, too, had something of deep importance to say – to a partner, a child or parent – and yet we didn’t. It was there in the atmosphere, but never got through. The painting gives dignity to our troubles and unfulfilled hopes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there’s an uncomfortable fact about all this: you can get the ‘message’ or, if you like, the benefit of this lovely work quite well by looking at a postcard or indeed, the reproduction on this website. The facsimile doesn’t of course quite have everything about the physical presence of the original. But it does convey almost everything, let’s say 96%, of what is important. That’s not a bad figure – given the price difference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2812" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyB.jpg" alt="FRANCE SAINT LAURENT AUCTION" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Auction houses – just like the National Gallery, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art – are in the habit of insisting that, in order to derive the benefit of art, we have to go and see (and in some cases own) the original thing, the actual piece of canvas worked on by the actual hand of the great artist. It’s such an entrenched attitude, it’s got such prestige in our society, we hardly ever notice how strange and unhelpful it really is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it comes to literature, we’re streets ahead – and by reflex, far wiser. We don’t feel that, in order to read<em> A Tale of Two Cities</em> by Charles Dickens, we have to head off to the Victoria and Albert Museum every time to go through the original manuscript. We’re rightly sure that we can get everything that matters from a free e-book or a paperback (£4.99).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2814" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyC.jpg" alt="PM-190214-sothebyC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The difference is: we know what novels are for. We’re far far more confident around books. We’ve been handling them since childhood. We know the deal: you get to meet the characters, hear their stories, enter their imaginary world. They help with perspective, self-knowledge, consolation and inspiration. We might not often say it, but we get a direct therapeutic benefit from reading them. And we understand instinctively that this can happen not in an archive, but on the train or, even better, tucked up in bed or at the beach.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2813" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190214-sothebyD.jpg" alt="PM-190214-sothebyD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">You don’t need to go there</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should become equally confident about art; it would be so much wiser, cheaper and easier. Works of art aren’t endlessly mysterious things to which we invariably have to go and pay a physical homage. The national museums want us to, and one can see why – but we don’t always have to follow their call. We’ve been doing so long enough. Works of art are tools that can help our lives to go a little better. They influence our moods, remind us of important truths that are constantly slipping from our minds and – like Richter’s Wall – lend dignity to our sufferings. These are very valuable things. But nobody needs to pay millions, or take a day off and make a trip to an art gallery, just to get hold of them. The postcard is enough. 96% of the value of the Richter painting is available if you just scroll it up and take a look at it for two concentrated minutes. That’s a big saving. No wonder Sotheby’s, the National Galleries and anyone in their pay would be deeply unhappy to read this.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Even very secular people tend to admit that when it comes to architecture, religions have done some very beautiful things. You can be left utterly cold by all the superstitious aspect of religions, and yet still be in awe at the profundity, intricacy and sheer prettiness of many mosques, temples, cathedrals and churches.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/70/156730595_a1f88eb2f0_b.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="516" /></p>
<p class="p1">However, any nostalgia for these lovely buildings is always cut short by the thought that an end to faith must inevitably mean an end to the possibility of putting up anything like them today.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet on examination, it in no way logically follows that an end to our belief in sacred beings must mean an end to an attachment to certain sorts of atmosphere and architecture. In the absence of gods, we still retain a longing for calm, for community, for grandeur, for sweetness, for perspective – all of which can be found and celebrated through architecture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We still need secular buildings that, like the temples and cathedrals of old, create feelings of awe, gratitude, wonder, mystery and silence; buildings that bring us together for special moments of the year (the passing of seasons) or to mark key moments of our lives (births, marriages, deaths). We need abstracted awe-inspiring sonorous spaces that take us out of the everyday and encourage contemplation, perspective, love and (at times) a pleasing terror.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There have over the last 200 years been a few examples of buildings that have learnt from religion without themselves being religious &#8211; buildings that can inspire new generations of patrons and architects.</p>
<p class="p1">The tradition of the non-religious &#8216;temple&#8217; or &#8216;chapel&#8217; begins with the French sociologist August Comte in the 19th century, who invented a secular religion, as he called it &#8216;A religion for humanity&#8217; and designed some temples to go with it. He proposed that specially-built large halls would be decorated with portraits of the pantheon of his new religion&#8217;s secular saints, including Cicero, Pericles, Shakespeare and Goethe, all singled out by the founder for their capacity to inspire and reassure us.</p>
<p class="p1">A few of these Comte-inspired temples have been built. There is one in the Marais in Paris.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-AsV3Z1lU5_0/VQdhwxVo5OI/AAAAAAAAaG8/S3_ZLmvFagA/s1600/05.jpg?resize=741%2C350" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And three more in Brazil, including this one in Porto Alegre:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Templo_positivista.jpg?resize=694%2C520" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">In the 20th century, the most notable secular chapel is perhaps Mark Rothko&#8217;s building in Houston, Texas, a place full of melancholy serenity:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/32628/117745_sv.jpg?resize=634%2C421" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Though nominally a Catholic building, the firm atheist Henri Matisse&#8217;s chapel in Vence in the South of France deserves to be counted among the great secular temples.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/lieux-de-retraite.croire.com/lieu_images/76/Dominicaines_Maison_Lacordaire_06140.jpg?resize=703%2C463" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Equally impressive is Peter Zumthor&#8217;s field chapel near Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.e-architect.co.uk/images/jpgs/germany/bruder_klaus_kapelle_germany_jl060408_02.jpg?resize=679%2C509" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">The most recent, and in many ways the most profound and thought-through addition to the genre has been a building by the artist Grayson Perry, dedicated to thwarted female creativity and potential &#8211; and ostensibly focused on the cult of a fictional (but so was Mary&#8230;) deity called Julie Cope.</p>
<p class="p1">The building has been designed to evoke a tradition of wayside and pilgrimage chapels in the landscape. It is a singular building, appearing as a small, beautifully crafted object amongst the trees and fields.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7145" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/150427_LivingArchitecture_Essex_030.jpg?resize=542%2C361" alt="150427_LivingArchitecture_Essex_030" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="" src="http://i1.wp.com/static.dezeen.com/uploads/2015/05/A-House-for-Essex_FAT_Grayson-Perry_Jack-Hobhouse_dezeen_sq.jpg?resize=496%2C496" alt="A House for Essex by FAT and Grayson Perry" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00543.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7148" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00543.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="IMG-20150530-00543" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">On a sunny weekend, the building &#8211; in north Essex, England &#8211; attracts hundreds of &#8216;pilgrims':</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00539.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7149" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00539.jpg?resize=640%2C480" alt="IMG-20150530-00539" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">They come to pay homage to the &#8216;deity&#8217;, Julie Cope, who holds out her hands in a gesture of comfort and sustenance:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CFPCJigW0AE0NzD.jpg:large" alt="" width="687" height="490" /></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00529.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-7150" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG-20150530-00529.jpg?resize=687%2C515" alt="IMG-20150530-00529" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">These exceptional buildings are in fact only the beginning of a movement that could grow ever larger as the secular world becomes more conscious of its needs.</p>
<p class="p1">One could also, for example, imagine a building that would take up the traditional role of religious architecture in returning to us a sense of perspective.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>- A Building for Perspective</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering how much of our lives we spend exaggerating our own importance, it would be highly useful to come across an architecture than answers our need for perspective. </span>Architecture can perform a critical function by adjusting our impressions of our physical – and as a consequence also our psychological – size, by playing with dimensions, materials, sounds and sources of illumination. In certain buildings that are vast in scale or hewn out of massive, antique-looking stones; or in others that are dark save for a single shaft of light filtering in from a distant oculus; or silent but for the occasional sound of water dripping from a great height into a deep pool, we may feel that we are being introduced, with unusual and beguiling grace, to a not unpleasant sense of our own insignificance.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine a &#8216;temple&#8217; for perspective whose structure would represent the age of the earth, with each centimetre of height equating to one million years. Measuring 46 metres in all, the tower would feature, at its very base, a tiny band of gold only one millimetre thick, standing for mankind’s time on earth.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1349" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dystopia1.jpg" alt="dystopia1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/static.neatorama.com/images/2013-02/temple-to-perspective1.jpg?resize=600%2C422" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/01/dezeen_Temple-to-Perspective-by-Thomas-Greenhall-and-Jordan-Hodgson-3.jpg" alt="Temple to Perspective by Tom Greenall and Jordan Hodgson for Alain de Botton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/01/dezeen_Temple-to-Perspective-by-Thomas-Greenhall-and-Jordan-Hodgson-2.jpg" alt="Temple to Perspective by Tom Greenall and Jordan Hodgson for Alain de Botton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>- A Retreat for Thinking</b></p>
<p class="p1">Or imagine a retreat for focusing our thoughts. It is one of the unexpected disasters of the modern age that our new unparalleled access to information has come at the price of our capacity to concentrate on anything much. The deep, immersive thinking which produced many of civilisation’s most important achievements is now under unprecedented assault. We are almost never far from some machine that will guarantee us a mesmerising and libidinous escape from reality. The feelings and thoughts which we have omitted to feel and think while looking at our screens are left to find their revenge in involuntary twitches and our ever-increasing inability to fall asleep when we should. So we can picture a building for thought would lend structure and legitimacy to moments of solitude. It would be a simple space, offering visitors little beyond a bench or two, a vista and a suggestion that they set to work on unravelling some of the troubling themes that they have been using their normal activity to suppress.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1352" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/path.jpg" alt="path" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1">This is only a start: we also need new venues in which to get married, get to know other members of the community, mark deaths and ritualise and lend gravity to key moments of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secular societies should revive and continue the underlying aims of religious architecture: to place us for a time in a thoughtfully-structured, three-dimensional space in order to educate and rebalance our inner selves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most people nowadays believe that you can’t really say in any definitive way what is beautiful or ugly in urban planning. The idea that taste is relative has deep roots in modern culture. To dispute it is to risk being seen as slightly unhinged or even dictatorial.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2045" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designA.jpg" alt="Australia - Dec 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">You can’t say what’s beautiful and what’s not</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s totally understandable how this attitude came to have such prestige. It started out as a campaign for kindness. It seemed very mean to say that what someone loved the look or sound of wasn’t acceptable or legitimate. In some circles, forty years ago, if you’d said that you preferred the Beatles to Beethoven, there would have been disapproving stares and a few contemptuous mutterings. You’d have been made to feel that you were a bad person for having the ‘wrong taste’. It’s very good that this sort of condemnation has fallen completely out of fashion. Obviously people like different kinds of music and that’s fine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2046" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designB.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone loves Siena – though most people do</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There really do seem to be some entirely sensible differences of opinion around taste. You just can’t say absolutely that Paris is more beautiful than Siena. They’re both wonderful in different ways. They each meet a different need of the soul. One is expansive, ordered, grand; the other is intimate, with lots of crooked little twists and turns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2048" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS - 2004" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because it really isn’t possible to say which is best, decent people rightly opt for the view that this sort of thing is always going to be a personal question. It’s up to you which one you like more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this kindly, very sensible move, has an unexpected consequence. People who have no interest whatsoever in making any city even remotely beautiful or dignified can get away with some truly terrible construction projects free of any fear of being criticised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280314-designD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4509" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280314-designD.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="PM-280314-designD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Few people look at the waterfront of Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland, and feels deeply moved by the grace and sweetness of the scene. While most people find the centre of Paris wonderful and others will delight in the winding streets of Siena, no one on the planet responds deeply to the brutal cross city expressway and chunky stained brown office blocks of the city.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many planning restrictions in Brisbane – but they concern health and safety issues: the distance between street lamps, where electrical cables must be located or how tall a building can be. No one worries that that is slightly dictatorial. But the regulations say absolutely nothing about the most important thing: whether a building has to be beautiful or noble or grand or elegant. That is regarded as entirely beyond the range of governmental duty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So even though almost everyone on the planet thinks that either Siena or Paris is delightful and everyone thinks that Brisbane is a bit of a mess, we don’t dare to speak; we are left cowering. We feel paralysed – unable to state the obvious. And that’s because we have talked ourselves into the belief that taste is always relative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2050" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designE.jpg" alt="Various - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It didn’t occur to them that taste was relative: everything had to be a certain way</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet when we consider the effects of this polite belief, it’s slightly sickening. Societies that didn’t for a moment think that taste was relative managed to produce exactly the kinds of places that many people today find delightful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2052" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designF.jpg" alt="Various, Britain - Sep 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">By imposing a single standard of beauty wonderful cities were built</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We pay a huge price for our polite relativism. We’ve surrendered the biggest collective endeavour of humanity – creating cities – to people who couldn’t care less what they look like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2053" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designG.jpg" alt="PM-280314-designG" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By tracing the problem back to its root cause, one does manage to find a solution to the mess. There’s no need for any city government to find a single ideal, a perfect model for a city. Siena, Paris, Bath and Edinburgh all look very different. But in each case the planners in the past hit upon a pretty good basic model and imposed it widely. It wasn’t the same model. But they were all good enough. But in Brisbane – and a lot of other modern cities – there was a fatal refusal to select any model at all. So the result is chaotic ugliness – which no one likes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems strange to say that a large issue of modern society is essentially philosophical. We’re more used to thinking that the causes of our troubles are economic. But we are not too poor to build wonderful cities. We are something far, far worse and rather more shameful: we are too muddled in our minds.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Fake, copy, pastiche, forgery, reproduction. Many of the most bitter insults of the art world are designed to denigrate anything which is not the actual product of the master’s hand.</p>
<p class="p1">People will make a special trip to Milan and stand in long queues to see the original <em>Last Supper</em> painted by Leonardo da Vinci himself. If that work was ever to come up for sale – which in itself would be considered an outrage – the sums involved would be utterly gigantic.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2633" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SB_07_China_Dafen-00550-1.jpg" alt="China's Art Copy Center" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Just as useful as the original</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reproduction from a factory in the outskirts of Shenzhen, China, can be had for the price of a swanky new toaster. Its status is correspondingly very low indeed. If you had the original in your house, the most glamorous people in the world would want to be your friends. But if you display the copy, art world insiders will smirk and regard you as cultural low-life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve uncritically absorbed the idea that copies are worthless, deeply embarrassing kitsch. The nightmares of curators and gallery directors are haunted by copies. Hang a reproduction by mistake and your career is over.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But why? Why are copies always supposed to be so terrible? Even asking this straightforward question is suspect.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes, of course, a copy is truly terrible. It mucks up all the details, it gets proportions weirdly wrong, the colours become garish. But not always.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2634" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/van-gogh-3d-relievos-copy-korenvelden1.jpg" alt="van-gogh-3d-relievos-copy-korenvelden1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultra high quality reproductions of <em>Wheatfield under Thunderclouds</em>, based on the original in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. You couldn’t possibly tell it apart from the original, unless you used a microscope.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What if it’s a really good copy? What if the details are faithful? What if the proportions are harmonious and the colours lovely? A well-made reproduction carries 99% of the meaning of the original. And maybe that’s all that really matters to us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A postcard transmits a great deal of the original too. And if we’re honest we have to admit that quite often it’s the postcard that moves us later, while we didn’t feel or think anything very much when we stood gingerly in front of the original in the gallery, jostling for elbow room.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A huge fan of copies, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe – a central character of Western civilisation – had big reproductions of his favourite paintings in his dining room</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying can be good. We should be proud to display copies in our homes and public galleries. We should stop being so unreasonably obsessed with whether something is the original prototype. Our culture has spent a lot of time thinking about what can go wrong around copies. But the potential benefits and advantages of copying works of art have not been recognised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2636" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nocturne-blue-and-silver-chelsea-1.jpgLarge.jpg" alt="nocturne-blue-and-silver-chelsea-1.jpgLarge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Helpful – but it’s in Tate Britain, not in your kitchen at 11.30pm</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’ve come to think that art belongs in art galleries and thereby condemned ourselves to encountering works at times dictated by museum opening hours and holiday schedules. We hardly ever get enraged in Tate Britain. So we’re unlikely ever to have direct need of Whistler’s immensely calming vista of fog, water and evening lights when we actually see it in the gallery. So it would be very much better if we could hang a copy of this work in the kitchen or by the bathroom door – places where angst has a tendency to congeal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art works have therapeutic power. But usually this passes us by. Not because we are insensitive or unworthy. But for a more basic reason. Their messages are hitting us at the wrong time – at moments when we’ve no need of them – like adverts for winter coats on the first day of spring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying is the much-needed solution to this problem, because copies allow us to locate these important, beneficial images in the places where we can encounter them in our times of need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2638" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Nithsdale_Road_Tenements_Glasgow.jpg" alt="640px-Nithsdale_Road_Tenements_Glasgow" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sadly it’s unique. There should be thousands just like it</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The art world tends to stress rarity and uniqueness as very desirable. It’s an understandable attitude (money and jobs depend on it). But it’s also really unfortunate for the rest of us. Because ideally the best things would be in plentiful supply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to praise the Strathbungo Tenements in Glasgow as a unique, dignified and noble way of grouping one and two bedroom flats together in a single building. But actually it’s a terrible pity that there’s just one building like this. The city would have been very well served if this had been widely copied. If it had become normal, rather than unusual, for communal buildings to look this good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Copying the masterpieces increases the supply of good things; it brings down the price; it makes them more widely available. Rarity yields status for the very few, but is has nothing to offer a society as a whole.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2639" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Villa_Rotonda_side1.jpg" alt="640px-Villa_Rotonda_side" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Villa Rotonda: When you copy, you can chop and change as well</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Andrea Palladio is one of the greats of Italian architecture. He was also great at copying. He didn’t invent the front of his best house, the Villa Rotonda. He just reproduced an existing model.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/MaisonCarr%C3%A9e.jpeg" alt="" width="517" height="388" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Copy the front but make the back nicer, and change the colour too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But he didn’t merely copy. He helped his clients customise. They really liked the columns at the front of ancient, and much revered, Roman temples. But the rest was a bit inconvenient. They weren’t daunted. They weren’t too pious. They felt free – guided by Palladio – to chop and change. It’s the basic lesson of the Renaissance. Copy what you really admire and adapt the rest to suit your needs. Make it comfortable. Yet when the same argument is run about paintings, the art world gets hysterical. It’s one of the things that bothers sophisticated people about the Chinese painting factory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Imagine you like the Mona Lisa, but the background doesn’t work for you. So, change the colour of the mountains. It sounds terrible to some people. But in principle it is like Palladio’s attitudes to Roman temples: I like the front, but don’t much care for the sides…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Shakespeare had a similar attitude to traditional stories. He thought nothing of changing a bit here and there so the narrative would work better for a modern audience. This is the classical attitude to culture. It’s yours to refine, adapt and improve. Because you want and need a lot from it, it’s not just about preserving the past, it’s about adapting things for the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2641" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/SB_07_China_Dafen-00038-e1395185545298.jpg" alt="SB_07_China_Dafen-00038-e1395185545298" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">We get negative about copying in part because we’re not so sure what we really want from art. But in fact the point of art is to help us live our lives more wisely and with greater poise. Once we recognise that art has a purpose – a great and useful purpose – we can get less bothered about the difference between the original and a copy. Because, thankfully, a copy might do just as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You’ve been around an art exhibition of a favourite artist. Perhaps it was Barbara Hepworth, the mid-20th-century British sculptor, recently accorded a show by the Tate Gallery in London. On display were some of her greatest works, including ‘Two Figures’ and ‘Pelagos.’</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image01.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9262" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image01.png?resize=500%2C640" alt="image01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9263" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image00.png?resize=635%2C546" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show has made you intensely receptive to what one might call the vision of life promoted by Hepworth. It’s a confused feeling, but now that the show is over (you were there for forty minutes) you’d like to take that spirit back out into the world, you’d like to Hepworth-ify important parts of your daily existence. Hepworth seems to you an exemplar of a dignified British modernism that celebrates intellectual rigour, restrained sensuality, elegance, simplicity and harnessed emotional intensity. You want your surroundings and the tenor of your days to take on some of Hepworth’s ideology: you would love your workplace, your railway station, your TV programmes and your relationships to be influenced by her atmosphere (and strangely, it feels normal that the spirit of an artist might spread way beyond particular artworks and be applicable to fields as diverse as architecture and relationships).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s in this mood and with these covert aspirations that you find your way to the gift shop. It’s an extremely busy place. Almost everyone who goes to the show spends a few minutes looking around and the line at the till snakes out to the door. You’re excited and ready to spend. This &#8211; surely &#8211; is the opportunity to Hepworthify your life. So you look around the aisles: there are scholarly monographs (tracing Hepworth’s relationship with the St Ives School and with Henry Moore’s early etchings), there is a large catalogue, there are some postcards, there is a tea towel and there are pencils and mugs with Hepworth’s name on it. The latter seem the most popular items of all.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9264" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image03.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to be receptive to what is on offer but the gift shop seems not to welcome your aspirations. If only there had been other things for sale… Perhaps reproductions of the actual works or guides on how to Hepworth-ify your life… Your desires are rather unclear. All you know is that the gift shop has not lived up to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an important and no way isolated dilemma. The gift shop is quite simply the most important tool for the diffusion and understanding of art in the modern world. Though it appears to be a mere appendage to most museums, the gift shop is central to the project of art institutions. Its job is to ensure that the lessons of the museum &#8211; which concern beauty, meaning and the enlargement of the spirit &#8211; can endure in the visitor far beyond the actual tour of the premises and be put into use in daily life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The means deployed, however, are rarely on target. Aside from books, gallery gift shops usually sell postcards and household items with the names of artists on them. Postcards are such important mechanisms because they improve our engagement with art. Officially, our culture sees them as tiny, pale shadows of the far superior originals in the galleries a few metres away. But the encounter we have with the postcard may well be deeper, more perceptive and more valuable to us, because the card allows us to bring our own reactions to it. It feels safe and acceptable to pin it on a wall, throw it away or scribble on the front of it and by being able to behave so casually around it, our responses come alive. We consult our own needs and interests; we take real ownership of the object and because it is permanently available, we keep looking at it at various times. We feel free to be ourselves around it &#8211; as so often, and sadly, we do not in the presence of the masterpiece itself.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3151299445_a9cc50cf5b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9267" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/3151299445_a9cc50cf5b_b.jpg?resize=635%2C632" alt="3151299445_a9cc50cf5b_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, gift shops will rarely sell us actual reproductions of works; fake, copy, pastiche, forgery. Many of the most bitter insults of the art world are designed to denigrate anything which is not the actual product of the master’s hand. We’ve uncritically absorbed the idea that copies are worthless, deeply embarrassing kitsch. The nightmares of curators and gallery directors are haunted by copies. Hang a reproduction by mistake and your career is over. But why? Why are copies always supposed to be terrible? Even asking this straightforward question is suspect. Sometimes, of course, a copy truly violates the original. It mucks up all the details, it gets proportions weirdly wrong, the colours become garish. But not always. What if it’s a really good copy? What if the details are faithful? What if the shapes are harmonious and the colours lovely? A well-made reproduction can carry 99% of the meaning of the original. And maybe that’s all that really matters to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve come to think that art belongs in art galleries and thereby condemned ourselves to encountering works at times dictated by museum opening hours and holiday schedules. We hardly ever get enraged in Tate Britain. So we’re unlikely ever to have direct need of Whistler’s immensely calming vista of fog, water and evening lights when we actually see it in the gallery. So it would be very much better if we could hang a copy of this work in the kitchen or by the bathroom door – places where angst has a tendency to congeal.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image021.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9265" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image021.png?resize=550%2C658" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Art works have therapeutic power. But usually this passes us by. Not because we are insensitive or unworthy. But for a more basic reason. Their messages are hitting us at the wrong time – at moments when we’ve no need of them – like adverts for winter coats on the first day of spring. Copying is one much-needed solution to this problem, because copies allow us to locate these important, beneficial images in the places where we can encounter them in our times of need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the absence of copies, gift shops will sell us a lot of signed tea towels. They have discovered that people will buy objects heavily decorated with names of artists and their works: so we have Picasso table mats and Hepworth pencils.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such objects try hard to pay homage to artists. They would like to beautify the world and carry the message of artists deep into our homes, so that the spirit of Hepworth would be alive when we prepared the morning tea and Picasso would be with us as we mopped away the orange juice from the kitchen counter. The ambition is noble, but its method of execution perhaps less so. The gift shop objects do have a faint link to the names they honour. Monet probably liked tea-towels; but it is unlikely that he would have wanted one with his own painting printed on it. The spirit of his best works of art, the things we love in them, may be much more consistent with (for instance) a completely plain and beautifully textured towel. This is more truly a Monet towel than one with his name on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point isn’t to surround ourselves with objects which carry the actual identity of the artist and his or her work. It should be to get hold of objects which the artists would have liked, which are in keeping with the spirit of their works &#8211; and more broadly to look at the world through their eyes, and therefore to stay sensitive to what they saw in it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9272" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k1.jpg?resize=635%2C654" alt="15787496150_3c3e1e4966_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can imagine a different range of products to sell in the world’s gallery gift shops: objects which would be aligned with the values and ideals of artists rather than with their mere identities. The urge to buy something at the end of a museum visit is a serious one, because it involves an attempt to translate a sensibility we’ve come to know in one area (in carved wood or on canvases showing landscapes) and carry it over into another part of life (keeping the kitchen clean).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This points to the heart of what museums should really be about: giving us tools to extend the range and impact of what we admire in works of art across our whole lives. This is why the gift shop is, in fact, the most important place in the museum &#8211; if only its true potential could be grasped and made real.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">How do we eat when no one is there to see us? It’s tempting to think that it’s just a solo version of what we do when others are around. One setting, rather than two or more.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144035003_20d0cba9b4_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9738" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144035003_20d0cba9b4_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="144035003_20d0cba9b4_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, individually, in our hearts, we know that’s not true. We know, privately, that on our own we are far weirder, greedier and more imaginative than when we’re witnessed. But it’s a lonely, guilty knowledge. Because the cookery pages keep on pushing a different vision of what we’re like: that the norm is to be smart but casual, and to rustle up well-organised, carefully nutritious meals for one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that’s not normal at all, as we’re coming to realise, in part thanks to insights afforded us by new websites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152419476.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4535" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/152419476.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="US-VOTE-2012-DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what we’re really like</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It turns out it’s normal – indeed pretty much universal – to do odd things. So, in truth, they are not really odd at all. Alone, we are all less fussy, more fun, more idiosyncratic than we believe others might be. We think nothing of shoving some fish fingers on buttered bread and liberally coating them with ketchup. We try out pasta with marmalade sauce. The ideal feast might be six chicken drumsticks and a bar of chocolate and nothing else. We know this about ourselves. Yet we feel exceedingly reluctant to try it out with others. When you invite friends round to eat, you fuss and worry and make up elaborate concoctions. But in truth, they too might be delighted with a cheese sandwich and a bag of crisps.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2113" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-eatC.jpg" alt="PM-280214-eatC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideal, but not on the menu at the restaurant</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At a smart restaurant, one might secretly wish for canned tomato soup served with fries or a baguette stuffed with sausages. But deference to an idea of what is appropriate or normal prevents these desires being voiced and transmitted to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The distinction between what we actually like to eat and what we’re supposed to like eating is mirrored in so many other areas of life. We are gradually coming to recognise that, in a great many fields, it is normal to be a bit ‘abnormal’. Our true selves are not quite aligned with the way we’ve imagined other people to be or with the way we’ve described ourselves to others. The problem is not that we’re weird, but that we’re operating with a skewed picture of normality, one that leaves far too much of our real selves out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Through the first half of the 1800s, the English painter JMW Turner worked for his own pleasure on pictures which he never exhibited or even showed to anyone during his lifetime. He didn’t dare to try to find an audience. They were only discovered decades later, rolled up and mouldering in a basement.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Art as a solo supper</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In private, he happened to love watery effects in diffuse sunlight and didn’t much bother whether the outlines were accurate – which was totally at odds with sophisticated assumptions of the day. He could do the expected thing very well; it’s just that he really loved certain elements that official public opinion rejected.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2116" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-eatE.jpg" alt="PM-280214-eatE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">More expected – just less true to himself</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But when the more adventurous works became known, they were widely admired, far more so than the standard works for which he had been recognised to date. It was ironic in the extreme. It turned out that a lot more people sympathised with Turner’s intimate tastes than – in his lonelier moments – he had ever imagined. He thought it was just him. It squarely wasn’t.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a less dramatic – but still very important way – our secret eating styles are like Turner’s hidden pictures. In so many areas of life, we are still discovering and shyly daring to own up to our true selves.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The real me</span></h5>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You haven’t come to Rhodes to explore the medieval old town or the ancient temple of Apollo. You’ve not been drawn by a longing to try the local delicacy of chickpea fritters and unsalted ewe’s milk cheese. Your more sophisticated acquaintances would think it trivial. But you have come here for just one thing: to get some sun.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the beach, here, there are recliners under big straw sunshades on the beach. The water is warm. The heat envelops you and seems to ease the knotted muscles in your left shoulder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every day, the sky is perfectly blue and unclouded. From your hotel balcony, you look out onto an arid, scrubby hill; you love the sight of the baked and cracked earth because it speaks of week after week of hot, dry weather. For months – practically for your whole life, it feels – you have been craving sunshine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the north, the environment doesn’t feel benign. It can’t be trusted. You are always fending off something: the wind, the rain, the cold. Through the impossibly long winter and wintry spring you have been swaddling yourself in layers of garments. You hardly ever see your own legs – beyond a reluctant glance at their pasty paleness in the bath. You seriously wonder if anyone could find your body attractive these days. You eat for comfort. You’re always wanting scones or pies or big helpings of apple crumble. And it shows – somewhere under the habitual jumpers and coats. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But deep within you, you feel as if you are a creature essentially made for sunny mornings, hot, lazy afternoons and warm nights. That’s where you, homo sapiens, were designed to live. But by ingenious, effortful and it seems rather fateful manoeuvers, we humans have managed to sustain ourselves in fundamentally alien places that are reliably windswept, wet, icy and dreary for most of the year and only fitfully, capriciously anything else. We’ve made good lives for ourselves up there – in Wiesbaden, Trondheim, Hyvinkää and Calgary. But at a cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sunshine isn’t merely ‘nice’. It has a profound role in our lives. It is an agent of moral qualities: of generosity, courage, the appreciation of the present moment, confidence… When the world seems bountiful, material accumulation looks less impressive. When there is easy living, competition loses its edge. When it is so hot, there is no point trying to read – or even think too much. One is merely in the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are corrective attitudes. Too much of them and they turn against themselves. If the ways of the north are too dominant and entrenched in your life you need the virtues of the south. You have come to lie on the beach at Pefkos not because you are light minded or indolent. But precisely because you have become – by habit – so dutiful, serious, hard working, disconnected from your body, over-cerebral and cautious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a deeply noble search for wisdom and balance (which are the ideal goals of art and civilisation) that has led you here – to the world of sun cream, dark glasses, recliners and vividly coloured cocktails by the pool.</span></p>
