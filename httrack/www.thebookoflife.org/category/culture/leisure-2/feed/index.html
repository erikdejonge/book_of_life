				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When pop music started in a big way in the 1960s, it seemed at times like an especially silly medium, favoured by hormonal school girls </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and connected up with delinquent and tediously bizarre behaviour. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i0.wp.com/cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/photo/2014/05/1964-beatlemania/b37_40818023/main_900.jpg?resize=721%2C571" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, philosophy had a reputation for being deeply serious and impressive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the natural home of the big ambition to understand ourselves and transform the world through ideas.</span></p>
<p><img class="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/canada/2012/05/22/mounties_kept_eye_on_jeanpaul_sartre_documents_show/sartre_inoffice.jpeg?resize=721%2C542" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But since the 1960s, philosophy has stalled and pop has conquered the world. It is now the foremost medium for the articulation of ideas on a mass scale. This explains why, if it is to survive, philosophy must study pop; part of its salvation lies in understanding pop’s techniques so as to be able to become, in crucial ways, a little more like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a host of critical lessons philosophy can learn from pop. For a start, pop teaches us about charm. The great pop songs are bewitchingly, dazzlingly charming in the manner in which they get their messages across: they know exactly how to wear away our defences and enter our imaginations with easy grace. It’s a reminder that it isn’t enough for ideas to be correct. For them to become powerful and deliver on their promises, they need to know how to win over an audience. Pop is the most seductive force the world has ever known; it has more &#8211; and more devoted &#8211; adherents than all religions put together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is more deeply loved, more trusted, and a more constant companion in our joys and sorrows than any other art form.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o.jpg?resize=635%2C551" alt="4993995987_9e8cbfba1d_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop has become powerful in part because it has cleverly understood the division of labour. Those who can sing and hold the crowd may not be the same as those who know how to write music or arrange instruments. Pop is unashamed about uniting talent wherever it finds it, so that the final result can combine the most beautiful face with the finest voice, the best score and the most beguiling instrumental arrangement. Pop has overcome the Romantic hangup about the unique creator, it knows that the most intimate, heartfelt result may be the outcome of large-scale institutional collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop teaches us too about compression. It knows our lives are busy and has an extraordinarily ambitious sense of what could be achieved in under three minutes. Like all other art forms, pop is trying to communicate ideas, but it bypasses the more resistant intellectual parts of the mind. All the usual obstacles to reaching another person are stripped away in the name of visceral intimacy. Pop achieves what Pericles, Lincoln, Dickens and Proust were attempting &#8211; and spectacularly exceeds all of them. It provides the ultimate demonstration of the 19th-century theorist Walter Pater’s tantalising assertion that ‘All art aspires to the condition of music.’</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10100" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C635" alt="6585670913_b19f6c3b5c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like religion, pop knows that repetition is key. It works its effect through being heard again and again. It would prefer to grab three minutes from you every day, than three hours every two months. Like religious incantation, it is interested in working upon our souls cumulatively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop is intelligent in not being afraid of simplicity; it is too wise to be held back by pedantry or erudition. It knows that our emotional needs are in essence obvious: to be encouraged, to be held, to be jollied, to be reassured when we are alone, to be told something beautiful and uplifting. It doesn’t suffer from high art’s perverse addiction to subtlety. It accepts that the core of our minds may be astonishingly basic in its structure.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10108" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hqdefault.jpg?resize=550%2C413" alt="hqdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop is ultimately the master of collective euphoria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It possesses what churches and politicians would like, but are so rarely able to secure. It has worked out how to generate shared moments of deep emotion about important things. In the stadium, the singer functions as a high priest, for whom the flock might be ready to make major sacrifices; they would, in their benign frenzy, be willing to go anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That philosophy needs to learn from pop doesn’t preclude that pop needs &#8211; of course &#8211; to learn quite a bit from philosophy as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop currently touches on the big themes but doesn’t, as yet, properly take up many of the opportunities that lie its way. It is lacking in ultimate ambitions.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6966830273_1817c106c2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10113" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6966830273_1817c106c2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6966830273_1817c106c2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the future, we need pop musicians to take up the challenge of investigating the deepest truths, of getting behind transformative concepts and of making these into the things we’ll sing about in front of the bathroom mirror with our hairbrushes &#8211; so that they become the background sounds of our inner lives. The world waits for a redemptive synthesis between philosophy and pop.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/schooloflife1.jpg?resize=299%2C448" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Life, which is responsible for this website, is a global organisation with a simple mission in mind. We want to increase the amount of WISDOM in circulation. We are fighting for:</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Relationships</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Work</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Leisure</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Culture</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Selves</p>
<p>To increase Wisdom, we undertake a number of activities; run shops and classrooms, consult to businesses, write books, make films &#8211; and a diversity of other projects. Behind our activities lies a common way of looking at the world: a set of beliefs about the central challenges facing us and how our lives might be improved. Our thinking breaks down as follows:</p>
<p>1.<em><strong> Relationships</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree with the view (first put forward by Freud) that a fulfilled life is essentially made up of two ingredients: Love and Work. But we’re also aware that disappointment, frustration and a sense of failure are very often the norm in these arenas; which both saddens us and spurs our efforts.</span></p>
<p>In our thinking about love, we’re much indebted to psychoanalysis, which tells us that our childhoods mark us deeply and frequently leave us a legacy of trouble around relating to others. We can have difficulties trusting or being close, achieving the right distance or staying resilient. We are prone to ‘transfer’ a lot of emotions from our past on to present day scenarios where they don’t quite belong, and may thereby respond unfairly to partners without quite understanding what is driving us. We may (in the invaluable vocabulary of the English psychoanalyst John Bowlby) be either ‘avoidant’ or ‘anxious’ in how we behave with others.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/ywcacassclay.areavoices.com/files/2012/10/161_MotherBabySMALL.jpg?resize=442%2C502" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only hope of escape from these patterns is to become a little more aware of them. In our search to understand love, we are great believers in the benefits of self-knowledge and, most importantly, of that royal route to this knowledge: psychotherapy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current relationship difficulties also stem from a cultural source &#8211; which we call ‘Romanticism’. We’ve collectively given ourselves a deeply problematic Romantic picture of what good relationships should be like: we dream of profound intimacy, satisfying sex, an absence of secrets and only a modicum of conflict. This faith in love is touching, but it carries with it a tragic flaw: having high expectations can turn out to be an enemy of workable mature relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8609" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Chatterton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are instead drawn to what we’ve called a Classical approach. The Classical view is cautious about love. Classical people pay special attention to what can go wrong around others. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the standard of partners across society and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances. This view of people is fundamentally, but usefully, dark. Everyone is ultimately deeply troubled and hard to live with. The only people whom one can think of as normal are those one doesn’t yet know very well. </span></p>
<p>A Classical philosophy holds that because we are not naturally well equipped for the demands of relationships, we need a lot of assistance and education. We need a culture that helps us to understand ourselves and to form realistic expectations. We require regular reminders to be more patient, forgiving, understanding and appreciative.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8611" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Man writes 'I LOVE U' in the sand for his sweetheart, 1920-60." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The starting point has to be a frank recognition of our natural frailties: we have to accept that we have terrible tendencies to misinterpret people and situations and regularly fail at the challenges of getting close to others. We believe that love is a skill that has to be learnt, not an impulse that can just be followed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our quest to help relationships go better, we write books, make films, run classes and offer psychotherapy.</span></i></p>
<p>2. <em><strong>Sexuality </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also aware of the scale of the hopes and challenges around sex. Though we often believe ourselves to be living in a liberated age, it remains acutely difficult not to feel shame around many of our sexual impulses. It is especially tricky to communicate what we want to those we are drawn to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, technology has made pornography a constant feature of modern love &#8211; and a challenge to our desire to integrate our sexuality with other things we might care about, like tenderness, intelligence and dignity.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8613" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg?resize=587%2C477" alt="PM-040314-pornB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in removing some of the shame around sex by revealing that many so-called perversions and fetishes are just complex quests for intimacy. We believe in adopting a tragic view of sex, in which we can see that not all our desires can ever be fulfilled. Strategic pessimism has a role to play in managing the demands of the libido.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our work on sexuality, we write books, make films, run classes &#8211; and run a pornography site at </span></i><a href="http://www.pornastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.pornastherapy.com</span></i></a></p>
<p>3.<strong><em> Work</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the distinctive ideas of modern times is that we don’t expect work to be simply a drudgery that we have to undertake to survive. We have high expectations of this huge part of our lives. Ideally, we want work to be ‘meaningful’, which involves the belief that we are in some way either reducing the pain, or increasing the happiness of other humans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seem to be three things that imbue work with meaning. Firstly, a meaningful job taps into the deepest, most sincere and talented parts of us. So different people will necessarily find different sorts of work meaningful, according to what is inside their deepest self: for some meaning might emerge from baking bread, others will feel their deep self engaged by computer science, for others still, they will feel mostly full themselves, most fully alive, when investing money or teaching kids a foreign language.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8617" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="16371178501_34359cb448_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, a meaningful job is one which to some extent helps others: which fixes a problem that humans have: a job which in ways large and small, serves humanity. Meaningful work provides a service to others. And thirdly, a job feels meaningful when the person doing it can viscerally sense, day to day, the impact of their work upon an audience. In other words, not only is the job theoretically meaningful, it actually feels meaningful as one does it in the course of an average day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should it be so hard to find meaningful work? Why are we in such danger of doing work that brings in money but doesn’t fulfill the meaning side of us? Three big reasons stand out: firstly, because it&#8217;s perilously hard for us to locate our true interests in the time we have before simply paying the bills becomes an imperative. Our interests don’t manifest themselves spontaneously, they require us to patiently analyse ourselves and try out a range of options, to see what feels as if it might have the best ‘fit’ for us. But unfortunately, schools and universities, as well as society at large, doesn’t place much emphasis on this stage of education; on helping people to understand their authentic working identities. There’s far more stress on simply getting ready for any job, than a job that would be particularly well suited to us. Which is a pity not just for individuals, but for the economy as a whole because people always work better, harder and more fruitfully when their deep selves are engaged.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8621" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg?resize=635%2C383" alt="FOX 2013 Summer TCA Tour - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, many jobs are relatively meaningless because it’s very possible, in the current economy, to generate profits from selling people things that aren’t really helping them in any way, but hoodwink them or prey on their lack of self-command. Most of us have a dangerously loose hold on what really brings us satisfaction long-term: which gives room for entrepreneurs to build huge and profitable businesses selling stuff which no one is particular proud of at the end of an average day. Those who work in these businesses know in their hearts that they haven’t really helped anyone have a better life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, a job may have real meaning, may genuinely be helping others, but it may not feel like this day to day because many organisations are so large, so slow moving, so split up over so many continents that the purpose of everyone’s work day to day gets lost amidst meetings, memos, conference calls and administration.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8623" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="5380585665_72842b37ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This diagnosis helps to point the way to what we might begin to do to make work more meaningful for people: firstly, pay a lot more attention to helping people find their vocation, their real working authentic self; through moves like career psychotherapy, extended work placements and changes to school and university curricula so as to allow students to start to analyse their identities and aptitudes from a much younger age. Secondly, the more we, as customers, can support businesses engaged in meaningful work, the more meaningful jobs there will be. Consumers have an enormous power over what kind of lives we can have as producers. By raising the quality of our demand, we raise the number of jobs there are which can answer to mankind’s deeper needs. Thirdly, in businesses which do carry out meaningful work, but on too large a scale over too long a period for it to feel meaningful day to day, we need to get better at telling stories of what the business is up to. We need to give work some of the intimacy of a small business, even if it’s a giant multinational; lending to those who work there a tangible sense of their contribution to the whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that work is meaningful is no luxury: it determines the greatest issue of all in modern economics and politics: how hard and well people will work &#8211; and therefore how successful and wealthy our societies can be.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We run a Business unit that works with companies to create more meaningful products and services; we also run a learning and development department which resolves many interpersonal issues in workplaces and we offer psychotherapy and life coaching which helps people discover their vocation and unpick conflicts around careers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<strong><strong><em> Education </em><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>Our ability to learn is one of the most basic things about the human condition. The range of things that we can learn to do better, via instruction, is very wide. However, the powerful influence of Romantic thinkers, who were convinced that important psychological things could not be taught, means the current education system leaves us stranded with all sorts of issues which are not passed down across generations, because they are believed to lie in the realm of intuition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take the more Classical view that all important human achievements can be taught: how to design a city; how to have a conversation, how to be a loving parent, how to be calmer or more creative&#8230;  We currently receive no instruction around self-knowledge (how to keep calm, for example, or learn to forgive). Such things are not seen as being at the core of education and even as things than can’t be learned. We passionately disagree.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8626" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Businessmen At Conference Table" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re aware of how easily people are turned off by anything that appears too preachy and by the fatal tendency for what is worthy to come across as dull. Our commitment to education makes us very interested in seduction and charm: that is, in the arts of getting and holding people&#8217;s attention in a highly individualistic world filled with distractions and demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because education is so central, we are ambitious about all the things that can educate us. Education isn’t just what goes on in schools: the arts and the media have hugely educative roles &#8211; but our culture has tended to shy away from acknowledging them.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://pierjacobsen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/daily-mail.png" alt="" width="404" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should not only be children who go to school. Adults in general should see themselves as in need of education. One should never be done with school. One should stay an active alumni, learning throughout life. In the adult section of schools, there should be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. There should be career advice for the middle-aged. Schools should be where a community gets educated, not just a place for children. So children should feel that they are participating in the early stages of a life-long process. Some classes should have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia the phrase ‘I’ve finished school’ would sound extremely strange.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life runs physical branches around the world where you can drop in for classes on almost any topic in the arena of emotional well-being. We also diffuse our lessons through films and books. We are interested in redesigning curricula; the programme of what to know to be ‘educated’.</span></i></p>
<p>5. <strong><em>Religion</em></strong></p>
<p>We’ve got a particular take on religion. We are clearly in a post-religious age but that doesn’t make us indifferent or hostile to religious thinkers. In fact the opposite is true: we are very keen on learning from religious thinkers. The technical errors of religions (for example, the claim that the soul can be reincarnated, that Christ rose from the dead or that the creator of the cosmos made specific promises about land rights at the eastern end of the Mediterranean) historically got entwined with some highly important, enduring large scale social and psychological ambitions. Religions have been machines for addressing psychological needs, which we still have.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8630" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="216342260_d4b816f8c1_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Religions at their best tried to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep ideas about forgiveness at the front of our minds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged compassion for the weak </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisted that worldly success was a fatally misleading way of assessing the worth of people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">got us to recognise our own capacities to hurt others and to feel sorry for doing so</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nudged us to be tender and understanding towards the secret sufferings of others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave us helpful rituals to keep important ideas before us throughout the year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see the School of Life as picking up many of the tasks of religion and creating secular replacements for particular religious ideals and practices (monasteries, weddings, funerals etc.). In agreement with the great thinkers of the 19th century, we believe that culture should replace scripture.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>6. <em>Culture</em></strong></strong></p>
<p>At the moment, culture (literature, art, film, photography, theatre) isn’t properly focused on taking up the crucial topics that religion formerly led the way on. People who want to express admiration for culture often say it’s valuable ‘for its own sake’. We can’t agree: it is valuable because it is capable of addressing our needs for education, guidance, consolation, perspective, encouragement and correction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are drawn to the idea that culture is therapeutic. The idea of a ‘therapeutic’ culture isn’t that it should help us primarily with very urgent and severe mental health issues. It’s the idea that it can assist us to get better at managing the normal troubles of everyday life; like the tendency to get unhelpfully irritated with people we like, to lose perspective over minor matters, to lose sympathy with people who deserve our compassion and to take too harsh a view of our own mistakes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8634" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="NETHERLANDS-ART-RIJKS-MUSEUM-VERMEER-RFEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the various branches of culture having a therapeutic function isn’t new &#8211; it’s an idea started by Aristotle and endorsed by, among many others, Hegel and Nietzsche. We can here highlight some of the key therapeutic powers of conspicuous areas of cultural life:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps us around inescapable failures and follies. The normal instinct is to be very annoyed with ourselves and others when we mess up. Unfortunately, this instinct often doesn’t serve us very well. Comedy, at its best, makes the therapeutic move of showing the fool as loveable. We don’t laugh at the fool out of derision, but out of unexpected sympathy.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8636" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="jan-6-david-brent-dance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">History</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teaches us to deal more effectively with the problems that face us today. It introduces us to ideas that were in circulation in the past but which are needed now. History is a corrective to the myopia of the news industry.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painting and the visual arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help us by being (in Hegel’s terminology) ‘the sensuous embodiment of ideas’. Often even very good ideas need to be experienced in a sensory way before they become meaningful to us. This power is revealed when a skilled piece of photography on the news makes us suddenly feel personally very touched by a geographically distant event which had previously left us cold. The role of the visual arts is to build up the images that we ought to have playing often in our minds at the difficult moments of our lives.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8638" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Cardinal Marc Ouellet presides over the" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the role of music is to support beneficial emotions and states of mind. Many states that are very important to us (calm, patience, modesty without being crushed, hopefulness, forgiveness) also tend to be fleeting and elusive. We need them, but on our own, we struggle to hold onto them. Music is a therapeutic cultural mechanism for deliberately and strategically making certain states of mind more reliably available.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has an astonishing ability to take us inside the experience of other people. So we can, even if only briefly, experience the world through the eyes of those who once seemed foreign and threatening, a move we find so hard in our daily lives. Novels lend us more lives than we have properly been granted.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8641" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PRIDE AND PREJUDICE - 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architecture </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates environments that have characteristics comparable to human ones. We need buildings and cities that encourage our own better natures &#8211; by presenting in a lasting and very large-scale way the characteristics we ourselves have at our best. Ideally, buildings give long-term and public encouragement to the social virtues of harmony, modesty and dignity.  </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of communication: it promotes identity. What we wear tells other people (and ourselves) something about who we are. Fashion tends to strike serious people as vain and silly because the messages that clothes happen to send are often not very helpful or admirable. But they sometimes are and could be much more.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.fashiongonerogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MargetHowellSS1.jpg?resize=483%2C633" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe that the world has, up to now, not properly made use of the huge therapeutic potential of culture. We pay reverence to culture: but we have not yet learnt how to use it systematically.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life has curated a number of museum shows which put our theories on public display. We run websites at </span></i><a href="http://www.artastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.artastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="http://www.booksastherapy.com"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.booksastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="http://www.foodastherapy.org"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.foodastherapy.org</span></i></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have built a secular monastery in mid-Wales with the architect John Pawson.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>7. <em>Politics </em></strong></strong></p>
<p>We believe that paternalism has an important role to play in good societies. We know how scary that can sound and how strong libertarian voices can be. Libertarianism is an exaggerated stance with roots in all our psyches and says that no one else can know what is right for another person, most of all a government. Freedom and choice are everything. No one should be telling us &#8216;what to do&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, we believe that a good paternalistic government won’t ever be imposing an alien agenda. A sound democratic government is able to remind voters that a certain piece of legislation is what they themselves would ask for in their calmer, more reasonable, more tender moments. It’s not that the government is claiming to know best; it&#8217;s that we as individuals know best, but because we’re leaky vessels, we forget &#8211; and therefore willingly entrust the government with the task of drawing us back to our own, temporarily neglected, insights.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8646" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="14451317753_8923ae663e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, nationalism makes a valuable contribution to people’s lives. We should be able to feel proud of our countries &#8211; out of admiration for their virtues. It’s good for us, as individuals, to participate in projects that are bigger than ourselves: things we’d love to do but can’t manage on our own. At the moment we recognise this around sport. We argue for the extension of collective pride to other, more consequential, parts of life.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s wise to operate with a broad conception of politics. Politics should include a concern for psychotherapy and for what is broadcast on television. Aesthetics is a political matter: it matters how the world looks. The physical environment we create feeds back states of mind to us. Economics must be geared to the happiness of the greatest number. The task of politics is to create the platform for individual and collective flourishing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life sees itself as a political organisation.</span></i></p>
<p>8. <strong><em>The Media</em><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>The media is hugely important to our chances of fulfilment &#8211; because it gives a society a picture of itself, shapes the agenda of politics and claims to know what information is most vital to us.</p>
<p>However, very often, the media presents a challenge to our attempt to lead good lives; it prevents us from seeing the real issues and holding on to them, it is obsessed either by unhelpful ideologies or by a commitment to a bland neutrality of ideology; it is a breeding ground for feelings of undigested envy and material dissatisfaction; it fails to explain the economy to us; it informs us about disasters in other lands without granting us the tools for empathy; it constantly frightens and alarms us, heightening our sense of fragility; it leads us to distrust strangers and to have a very bleak view of collective life.</p>
<p>Part of learning how to stay sane is to have a robust approach for how to deal with the stream of incoming information from the media.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life ran a news organisation at </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.philosophersmail.com">www.philosophersmail.com</a>, set up <a title="News as therapy" href="http://newsastherapy.com" target="_blank">www.newsastherapy.com</a></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and now runs a popular Youtube channel (<a href="http://youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv</a>). It is deeply interested in mass communication.</span></i></p>
<p>9. <strong><em>Consumerism </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a fairly widespread anxiety around consumption. Thoughtful people often complain that ‘we’ve become too consumerist’ or they say they’re sick of ‘materialism’.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think that it’s not consumption or materialism &#8211; buying things and getting excited by possessions &#8211; that’s really the problem here. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is that we’ve not collectively made a clear distinction between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of these things. We agree there’s plenty of bad consumption around. But the way to deal with it is to beef up our capacity for good consumption. The same goes for materialism. It turns out there are very good kinds of materialistic behaviours.</span></p>
<p>Material objects can play positive psychological (or spiritual) roles in our lives. Our highest ideals can get ‘materialised’ in physical objects, so that by buying and using these things we’ll be getting closer to our better selves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.nest.co.uk/product-media/N0C/1200/900/Wastberg-Chipperfield-w102-Table-Lamp.jpg?resize=579%2C434" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be surprising to recall that religions have often been very in favour of certain kinds of materialism. At the core of Catholicism, for instance, was the idea that the faithful could get closer to Jesus by joining in a re-enactment of the Last Supper. The bread and wine &#8211; which believers consumed during the mass &#8211; were the outward, physical signs of the spiritual nourishment that was on offer. The big insight was that the ‘outward’ material parts were crucial. In theology this move was called ‘transubstantiation.’ It deserves a special word, because it’s a crucial idea: a physical object can take on a new spiritual identity, it can be the outward shape that a higher value needs to adopt in order to best be encountered in our lives. So, ideally, every good material possession ‘transubstantiates’ our psychological needs in a physical form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religions have often cared hugely what their temples look like, what clothes people wear in sacred places, how you should move, how loud you can speak, what the lighting should be like, how the furniture should be designed. In other words they had a host of strongly material concerns. But they had them because they were determined to get material things to serve a higher and noble purpose: the development of one’s soul.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8654" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_(Rafael)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same move applies outside of religions. Material objects are good when they support our own better nature and consumerism is good when it is geared to providing ourselves with these kinds of possessions. There’s a crucial constructive psychological role for possessions. And good consumerism occurs when people get really focused on finding the objects that can play this role for them. Hunting for the ideal alarm clock, or the perfect pair of socks, needn’t be the enemy of the wise and mature life.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life operates a retail unit at </span></i><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.theschooloflife.com/shop</span></i></a></p>
<p>10. <em><strong>Capitalism </strong></em></p>
<p>Economies look as if they are basically about huge material facts &#8211; oil fields, communications satellites, huge retail complexes, vast entertainment districts. But behind these impressive factors, we believe, that the economy is to an extraordinary extent a psychological phenomenon driven by our collective appetites and our imaginations and longings. It is what people are willing to pay for that generates profit and organises the whole system of investment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education of the customer is, therefore, one of the key economic moves for today. It was a big theme in the past. Some of the great thinkers focused their ambitions in this area. John Ruskin and William Morris hoped to transform the economy (and hence change how profits were made and who would get rich) by influencing what people wanted. They had ideas about what consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want, whereas today the most energetic efforts are made to track (and meet) whatever consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to want.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8656" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="aod-jaguar-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our big shot at influencing preferences and taste is via advertising. But that’s not usually got the real needs of the consumer at heart. What advertising does though is show how much can be done to shape taste and preference. We’d like to see equally creative and seductive advertising that was trying to promote the things we genuinely need (a couple might need to forgive each other more than they need a holiday; a child might need to feel less paralysed by homework, more than they need more take away pizza).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re very impressed by the productivity of capitalism &#8211; and we want to harness it to even more ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, capitalism has unsurprisingly tended to focus on the supply of our more basic needs. We’re interested in a kind of capitalism that operates further up Abraham Maslow’s famous Pyramid of Needs: that’s as efficient at meeting our needs for understanding as for sweet things to eat; that’s as great at helping us find OK partners as it is, at present, great at uniting us with the ideal sandwich.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8658" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png?resize=466%2C349" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we don’t think the question should be: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalism &#8211; yes or no? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core issue is about improving capitalism to make sure it is fulfilling our highest needs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life tries to tug businesses to make a better sort of capitalism via its business unit: </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/business">www.theschooloflife.com/business</a></span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the School of Life, we are keen to demonstrate that the proper role of ideas is to lead to the transformation of our societies in positive directions. We hope that our ideas will be, above all, ideas to live by.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cultural mining describes the process by which the most valuable parts of culture &#8211; by which we mean the arts, humanities and philosophy &#8211; are recovered and made useful for our own times.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In cultural mining, the refined and practical essence of culture is carefully extracted, cleaned, blasted and remoulded &#8211; and then used to manufacture the utensils and mental resources that will help us navigate contemporary life; work, relationships, family, self-knowledge and so on.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18519962993_612979d290_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9543" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18519962993_612979d290_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="18519962993_612979d290_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a historic problem of major proportions that hugely valuable Cultural Insights have often been lodged within highly unappealing material far below ‘ground’. It has been dark and cramped in the corridors of culture and hardly anyone other than certain accredited experts have been tempted or allowed to visit. Their labours have had a lot of prestige, but in truth, the material has been like metal in ore, entirely impractical in its raw state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Culture to be useful to us, it needs to go through a process of refinement, which may involve quite radical, even drastic, moves. One needs to excise cultural insights from a lot of surrounding material. Insights have to be forcefully separated from contexts and then twinned with real world issues so as to bring out their dynamism. Insights have to be skilfully fitted to live contemporary problems so that their helpfulness emerges. They must be translated from an arcane language of the deep into a spoken language of the surface, culture moving from a learned to a living dialect. Finally, like in gold mining, only a very small portion of what had originally been dug out will ever be usable to make the finished precious item that is sought: a good idea.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9545" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h.jpg?resize=635%2C628" alt="12941953093_f3e4257cd8_h" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is around this process of refinement that the big difference between us and academia becomes apparent. We&#8217;re very grateful to academia for digging the mineshafts and keeping open the tunnels &#8211; but we have a different project, we are interested in the extraction and utilisation of the material on the surface, rather than its preservation and interpretation below ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of cultural mining is new and still feels a little weird. But it has a critical role to play in our world because, at present, lots of people don&#8217;t &#8211; grievously &#8211; believe that culture has anything much to offer them. This isn’t their fault of course. When you look at the raw material form in which culture is generally laid out before us, that&#8217;s not surprising. But there is no need to stay stuck at this level forever.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9546" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="17092903380_5ea5aba8e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve only just started the business of cultural mining. We&#8217;re only now starting to extract the true value of culture in a systematic and ambitious way. But there is much to look forward to for, when we get to it, there is enough down there, deep in the often clammy and dark cultural ground, to help us meet the multiple confusions and anxieties of our times.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a distance, it seems weird, irrelevant, boring and yet also – just a little – intriguing. But it’s hard to put a finger on what the interest really is. What are philosophers? What do they do? And why does one need them? <span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, the answer is already contained in the word</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> philosophy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> itself. In Greek, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means love – or devotion – and</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sophia</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means wisdom. Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom. </span>Though a bit abstract, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence.</p>
<p>The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. You could perhaps say ‘happiness’ but ‘happiness’ is misleading, for it suggests continuous chirpiness and joy, whereas ‘fulfilment’ seems compatible with a lot of pain and suffering, which every decent life must by necessity have.</p>
<p>So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</p>
<p>Here are films on some of our favourite philosophers:</p>
<p><strong>1. Plato </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you had the misfortune to do too much of it at school, you’ll probably remember one thing about history: just how boring it can be. </span>You might harbour painful memories of the 100 Years War, the War of Spanish Succession, Crop Rotation in the Middle Ages or &#8211; heaven forbid &#8211; the good deeds of Florence Nightingale. As a result, it wouldn’t be surprising if &#8211; nowadays &#8211; you tended to steer well clear of the whole topic.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8556" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579.jpg?resize=635%2C616" alt="707px-Florence_Nightingale._Coloured_lithograph._Wellcome_V0006579" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>But that would be a pity. The real reason why history is so boring is that we’re not clear about what it should be for. Here’s the big reason why history matters: it matters because it can provide us with solutions to many of the problems of the present.</p>
<p>At its best, history is there to introduce us to some of the things we need but that aren’t sufficiently visible in the world today. <span style="font-weight: 400;">As a society, we’re very obsessed by what we’re up to right now. Unknowingly, we’re hugely biased towards the present. The news &#8211; which is about the most prestigious force in the world today &#8211; circles obsessively around some of the things that have happened </span><b><i>in the last five minutes</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>And yet, many of the most important things that we need to nourish, sustain and inspire us, are a lot older.</p>
<p>What we nowadays need above all else are good ideas and history is full of them. Imagine you’re dissatisfied with aspects of contemporary Capitalism. It might help hugely to read about the slow emergence of Capitalism in Medieval Europe, so as to be able to trace its positives and negatives.</p>
<p>Of if you want to question how people get married, it helps to know a little more about the history of love&#8217;s relationship with marriage.</p>
<p>There are tons of missing ideas that have got wedged in the past; in volumes written long ago and not looked at in decades. Our films are attempts to rescue some of these ideas for our own times.</p>
<p><strong>1. Romanticism </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sociology is the academic study of social behaviour, particularly around work, love, class and status. It is &#8211; if you like &#8211; a form of very deep journalism. Like journalism, sociologists are interested in the way we live now, but unlike journalists, they go into things far more profoundly. Sociology has, in its history, asked such pertinent questions as: Why do people watch so much bad television? What is the relationship between class and cultural taste? Why do people commit suicide? And: why are some cultures individualistic and others more collective?</p>
<p>Here is a selection of our favourite sociologists:</p>
<p><strong>1. Max Weber</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Political theorists are not interested in politics in the way it&#8217;s defined by news organisations; they don&#8217;t care about a specific bill going through parliament or the scandal surrounding a trade minister. They&#8217;re interested in politics in the big, and fascinating sense: the discipline that tries to work out how we can live well together in the <em>polis</em>, the community derived from the Greek word for city. Political theorists steps back from the day to day and ask large questions like: what is a good society? What is the relationship between freedom and liberty? How can a society pursue beauty and wisdom, as well as money?</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8558" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="800px-Eugène_Delacroix_-_La_liberté_guidant_le_peuple" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Most political theorists have been philosophers; it&#8217;s natural to see why. Philosophers are interested in happiness, wisdom and fulfilment &#8211; and at some point, these issues will inevitably lead to questions about how the state and community are run. There is simply no more interesting or pertinent branch of philosophy than political theory. At the School of Life, we have defined some of our ideas in the section of this book called CAPITALISM. In the meantime, here are some of our favourite poltiical thinkers from history:</p>
<p><strong>1. Niccolò Machiavelli </strong></p>

<p class="p2">Philosophy begins in the Ancient World where it is immediately thought of as a highly practical discipline close to what we would nowadays think of as psychotherapy. One goes to see a philosopher to clear up a variety of emotional and intellectual confusions. The job of being a philosopher becomes extremely prestigious. Different schools of philosophy form, each one claiming a better grasp on the ingredients of true calm and fulfilment than the next. Here are the four great strands of Ancient Greek philosophy:</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>1. Plato</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eastern Philosophy was largely unknown in the West until the late eighteenth century. Since then, it has achieved enormous popularity, by virtue of its practical orientation and its devotion to cures for everyday ailments of the soul. In its devotion to the ordinary, it is in many ways the successor of the great therapeutic philosophies of Ancient Greece and Rome. Here are a selection from the great voices of Eastern philosophy:</p>

<p>We have a general sense that the humanities are filled with things that are deeply important. But what exactly are they for?</p>
<p>The humanities are a repository of useful and consoling ideas that can help us face pressing personal and professional issues. We can turn to novels and historical narratives to impart moral instruction, paintings to reawaken our empathetic powers, and philosophy to probe our anxieties and offer consolation.</p>
<p>Here we look at four great strands of the humanities and ask how they can help us live:</p>
<p><strong>1. What is Art For? </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Traditionally, philosophy has been nervous around the idea of communication. Reaching out has not been high on the agenda. Academic philosophers have frequently erected barriers to wider participation: abstruse vocabulary and hypercomplex arguments have seemed to guarantee intelligence – all of which is a great pity.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy is simply the pursuit of wisdom. And though it’s a rather abstract term, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence. The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philoclass.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-3717" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/philoclass.jpeg?resize=555%2C375" alt="University students and professor have philosophy discussion on floor" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why there is always a need to make wisdom widespread: something for the many, not just for the few. It’s a need that is especially great in societies like ours which are driven by the currents of popular opinion and mass consumption.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s on this basis that we started a YouTube channel, which you&#8217;ll find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A YouTube channel shouldn’t be seen as a painful concession to the lamentable demands of a coarsened world. It is, in fact, bringing philosophy closer to its true ideal. Because wisdom clearly does not in the end belong merely in a seminar room or academic hall. It belongs in the day-to-day practices and mental habits of our lives. Philosophy is how you handle rejection, or cope with frustration or work out how to help another person – these are the real goals for which the finest intellectual labour is only at best the preparation (and sadly from which it can be a terrible distraction).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The technology is of recent date, but the underlying move is not new. A YouTube philosophy channel is just today’s version of the windows of Chartres Cathedral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/window.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3718" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/window.jpeg?resize=635%2C404" alt="The Good Samaritan cares for the Pilgrim, stained glass, Chartres Cathedral, France, 1205-1215." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the Middle Ages, leading thinkers knew that hardly anyone would read their theological treatises. They didn’t quietly resent the situation. They took action. They realised the importance of popularisation. They accepted that a glowing, vivid stained-glass window could achieve much the same as a book, and could be used alongside literature as an aide to the ultimate goals of enlightenment. The point of the window was to show why being kind – why helping a stranger in need is a good thing to do. But writing books or essays isn’t the only way to put this argument forward. What’s needed for many is encouragement and stimulation of a more emotional, direct kind. So the windows are brought in to tell the story of the Good Samaritan in a vivid way. We can see the unpopular man who is moved by ordinary, and effective, generosity to help another in their hour of need. The windows are not ‘selling out’ or cheapening the message, they’re bringing it to life in a narrative, visual manner.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The task is to carry from one end of society to the other, the best knowledge and the best ideas of our time. We should be trying to divest philosophy of all that is harsh, uncouth, difficult, abstract, professional, exclusive about it. We need to humanise it – and to make it efficient outside the clique of the cultivated and learned.</span></p>
<p class="p1">In a populist, market driven society, it is no use keeping philosophy for the few, and writing books that only a hundred people can understand. The real task is to know how to popularise. If philosophy is to be properly powerful, it has to learn to be popular first. Therefore, do check in regularly to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, please subscribe and pass the news on to friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Although many of us like comedy a lot, it feels odd to ask basic questions about its purpose. &#8216;What is comedy for?’ sounds like a leaden inquiry directly opposed to the spirit of humour.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But really it is a way of getting more ambitious about what laughter can do for us. Intuitively, we feel that comedy is one of the things that helps us cope with the difficulties of living. </span>A clue can be found in the fact &#8211; which at first sounds a bit surprising &#8211; that we don’t laugh at things unless they cause us very serious problems at other points in life. We can see this in the standard category of jokes: about relationships, family, sex, money, impotence, bowel movements&#8230; We laugh most readily around things that in other ways are very distressing. A good joke invariably has a relationship with darkness, anxiety and pain.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6501" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="jan-6-david-brent-dance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">David Brent taps into a deep source of anxiety: making a fool of oneself at work</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy offers us a way of having a better time around things which, otherwise, can feel pretty disastrous. Ideally, in the utopia, comedy and its therapeutic potential wouldn’t be left to chance. Humour would be deliberately cultivated as a benign response to a range of entrenched difficulties. Previously, certain countries had an elaborate carnival season devoted to enforced comic activities. For a brief time, the weak could boss around the powerful, priests and nuns were supposed to hold obscene rituals in their churches, serious people were required to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>get drunk and throw bags of flour over each other’s heads. Humour wasn’t just left to those who felt so inclined: it was a kind of duty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, the idea of the court jester &#8211; an officially licensed and salaried comic &#8211; was built on the importance of humour to the mental health of the powerful. Even if in the council room or around the dinner table, the leading people didn’t feel much like joking, the jester was required to make barbed, witty and perhaps mocking remarks to deflate pomposity and restore perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comedy is so important, its presence should be embedded in the calendar and in the fabric of institutions. It’s a requirement &#8211; like having our teeth checked or doing the accounts. There are perhaps six key ways that comedy offers us therapeutic help. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: Comedy as Therapy for Despair</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many of our gravest problems don’t have viable solutions. We suffer, and then die. Work is painful,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>but we can’t escape it. There is no happily ever after in love…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A common artistic response has been to accept the darkness, to express it with dignity and to nudge the audience towards greater compassion for self and others. This is the spirit of Velazquez’s rendition of the dying Christ:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cristo_crucificado.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6502" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cristo_crucificado.jpg?resize=635%2C546" alt="A 4158" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A comic attitude doesn’t deny misery,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>but it has a very different relationship with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/life-of-brian-1979-03.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6503" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/life-of-brian-1979-03.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="life-of-brian-1979--03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Defiance in the face of suffering</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black humour is infused with a mood of defiance. One is going to laugh at, rather than buckle in front of, the miseries of existence. In<em> The Life of Brian, </em>the closing song brazenly states the worst about existence: ‘Life&#8217;s a piece of shit, when you look at it’. But instead of making us more aware of our feelings of sorrow (as tragedy does), the mood is mocking; there is a refusal to be gloomy: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ‘Always look on the bright side of life… purse your lips and give a whistle’. </span></p>
<p class="p1">In 1940, when Britain was in a precarious military situation, with the evacuation of Dunkirk and nightly bombing raids, a song mocking the Nazi leaders became wildly popular:</p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hitler has only got one ball,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Göring has two but very small,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Himmler has something sim&#8217;lar,</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">But poor old Goebbels has no balls at all.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic mockery didn’t remotely depend upon it being thought literally true. The enemy’s power was all too terrifyingly apparent. The point was simply that keeping cheerfully defiant was centrally important to the task of facing up to something very frightening indeed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black humour works on the assumption that we tend to despair too soon: that is, the situation feels more hopeless than it really is. It’s genuinely bad, but we experience it as truly catastrophic. We give up hope and thereby surrender our capacity to do what we still can to make things a little better. By mocking dangerous things, humour emboldens us. It helpfully paints what is potentially very frightening as deeply ridiculous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6515" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image16.png?resize=635%2C565" alt="image16" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Two remarkably small testicles</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Comedy as Therapy for Humiliation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Life is filled with things which threaten our dignity. We’re never far from being reduced to complete mockery. In the children’s television series Peppa Pig, the father &#8211; Daddy Pig &#8211; is always doing things that could be seen as absurd, humiliating or embarrassing. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6516" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image10.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image10" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the opening sequence, </span>he makes loud, rather obnoxious grunts. On a very hot day, he falls asleep in the sun and gets very red; Mummy and the children tip the contents of the paddling pool over him. Generally, around the house, he likes to do a bit of DIY and put up shelves: but everything he does is a bit wonky. He tends to get lost when driving the car. He’s overweight. He can come across as lazy. It would be extremely easy to make a very negative assessment of his character. That’s the kind of thing we tend to do for ourselves and other people: we regularly rehearse the case for the prosecution.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the cartoons, though, this very flawed creature is presented as somehow both flawed and extremely lovable: his wife and children are deeply attached to him and think he’s lovably clumsy. They don’t get to this positive verdict by not noticing his failings. They’re clearly very conscious of them &#8211; and they do tease him about his incompetence and tendency to take things a bit too easy. They do see him as a bit of an idiot. It’s just that they love him as he is. In their eyes he is a lovable fool. That’s what a lot of comedy helps us with. It turns people (ourselves included) who could just be seen as idiots into lovable fools.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If we happened to walk down the road and saw a man called Basil Fawlty bashing his car with the branch of a tree, we’d feel he was just some awful, furious, bloke venting his anger in a crazed, destructive way. We’d judge him a thoroughly unpleasant fool.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image031.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6517" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image031.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="image03" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Losing your temper doesn’t have to mean you&#8217;re an entirely bad person</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fortunately for Basil Fawlty, he’s not in real life but in a comedy by John Cleese and therefore, he isn’t just an idiot, he is a lovable fool. His vices are introduced alongside some deeply ingratiating qualities. The show teaches us to really like someone whom in real life we might have cursed. When we watch the show we’re on Basil’s side: we don’t withdraw our sympathy. The show is getting us to try out the unusual experience of simultaneously accepting that someone is crazy and still quite nice. We accept that Cleese’s character is sly, selfish, mean, incredibly tactless, snobbish and rude. And yet we like him. It’s a remarkable achievement on the part of the comedy team. </span>We’re rehearsing a move we need to make with others and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; with ourselves.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Daddy Pig and Fawlty Towers are developing an idea initially sketched by Jesus Christ. Christianity introduced the idea that a person could be of low social status, of ignoble appearance, lack talent and yet be fully deserving of love and consideration. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image02.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6518" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image02.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="image02" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Jesus was setting an example of <em>liking</em> people who could be seen as very unimpressive, because, seen in a particular light, pretty much everyone can be made to look a fool. The question is whether we have to see foolishness as inviting derision and contempt, or might come to view it as fully compatible with tenderness and affection &#8211; in fact, with love. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Comedy as Therapy for Self-disgust</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It can be pretty hard to live with ourselves; we’re so painfully aware of the gap between our ideals of how we’d like to be and the reality of how we actually are. So often we’re left feeling lonely with our flaws, failings and rather sordid ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7142" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="7109432537_c8bc3bdbfc_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h6 class="p1">© Flickr/Isabelle</h6>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">She’s<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lazy about the laundry and rubbish at loading the dishwasher</span></h5>
<p class="p1">Confessional comedy works by someone standing on stage and admitting in public that they have all the kinds of faults which we normally feel embarrassed and ashamed about. They interrupt our loneliness by admitting that they too get shy in public WCs and don&#8217;t know whether to shake hands with or hug acquaintances. We laugh with relief, as the pent-up anxiety is safely discharged.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They dismantle the secret fear of our own freakishness: and by making things feel more normal they make them more bearable too. Michael McIntyre makes public the little failings of parental life: how he can’t get his children to get their shoes and coats on, how he lazily hopes to get away with merely putting the dishes ‘near the dishwasher’ when cleaning up (‘would you pee near the toilet?’ he asks himself). They are often tiny, trivial things of course. That’s the point. Officially everyone manages just fine. Only in fact we don’t. And by portraying what he’s really like &#8211; rather than what an adult is meant to be like &#8211; Michael McIntyre is offering an antidote to self-disgust. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Comedy as Benevolent Stereotyping</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If someone says ‘You’re a bit of a Woody Allen’, it’s a benign alternative to thinking: &#8216;you’re a deeply annoying, over-intellectual neurotic nerd&#8217;.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image00.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6520" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image00.jpg?resize=635%2C483" alt="image00" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p1">Across his career, Woody Allen showed how quite negative characteristics could be reframed in a more endearing light. He provided a new &#8211; more kindly and insightful &#8211; way of stereotyping people. The problem with stereotypes is not so much that they generalise, but that they so often generalise unfairly and unkindly.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin_46535c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6523" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin_46535c.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Kevin_46535c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If parents get entertained by Harry Enfield’s character, Kevin the teenager, they can move from the panicked thought ‘our son has turned into a monster’ to the more constructive and less frightening idea that ‘my son has temporarily become Kevin the teenager’. It breaks the potential isolation and misery. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s the reverse of bad stereotyping. Comic characters almost always hold onto our sympathy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6524" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4d89817ca5844c308cc426ffa36519d4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To say that a work colleague is a bit of a David Brent isn’t merely to point out that they are tactless and insecure. It’s also to reframe those failings. Because we come to feel tender towards David Brent too. We see his vulnerability &#8211; not just his idiocy; we become good at recognising that it’s his anxiety about not being liked or respected that leads him to do deeply embarrassing things. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry_David.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6525" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Larry_David.jpg?resize=635%2C630" alt="Larry_David" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Larry David is always getting angry and abusive. He is incredibly combative and rude to waiters; he gets into huge arguments with people at the dry cleaners; he tells his friends what he thinks of their partners; he speaks his mind, even when it is totally inappropriate. But at the same time, he’s very charming. He’s a successful man, he has a lovely smile, he can be very sweet. So we’re reframing the ‘grumpy old man’ as ‘the charming, very engaging old man who is &#8211; frequently rude too.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic move is to guide us to a benevolent conception of these people &#8211; and hence to the parts of ourselves and those close to us who share some potentially very annoying characteristics. As a society, we need a lot more benevolent comic characters to be created &#8211; to help us cope with the infinite variety of maddening people around us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Comedy as Therapy for Power and Powerlessness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6526" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="image07" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hugely reassuring to see the powerful laughing at themselves. Finding oneself comical is a token of maturity. It means being able to see one’s faults, without being too defensive about them. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thing that intimidates us isn’t actually power. It’s power that looks like it’s going to be inhumane: insensitive, unkind power. So we’re intently interested in things that reveal a mature, kindly sort of power. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Humour often provides a mechanism whereby the powerless (or at least the less powerful) can give constructive but pointed feedback to the powerful. Monty Python was particularly focused on this task. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6527" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image05.jpg?resize=635%2C275" alt="image05" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Philosophers&#8217; Football Match mocks the great figures of intellectual history. It’s funny because we’ve been intimidated so deeply in the past by intellectual bullies who made us feel small with their references to Wittgenstein and Schopenhauer. And now these great totemic figures of intellectual life are shown as completely rubbish at football. The sketch is an attempt to show academic philosophers that they’ve needlessly frightened people and cut themselves off from the general public. The sketch is really a coded plea to philosophy to be kinder and more relevant. Monty Python have to be funny about philosophers because so far philosophers have been stubbornly bad at being funny and human about themselves. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Comedy as Therapy for Losing Perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We lose perspective all the time: a problem that is of moderate, manageable size can easily start to look much bigger than it really is. We get into a huge panic, or feel very endangered and react in ways that make the situation worse. Without meaning to, we exaggerate. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The comic technique for dealing with exaggeration is to exaggerate so much that our own inflated ideas come to seem small by comparison. It’s natural, for example, to worry that one’s conduct is inappropriate: that everyone else knows what you’re supposed to do and does it easily, while you don’t know the right thing and inadvertently make a fool of yourself. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6528" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image08.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="image08" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You might clap at the wrong moment in a concert hall; laugh during a speech at something that was meant to be serious; mistake the drinks waiter for your host, or say something that everyone else thinks in appalling taste. You can, however, not possibly reach the levels of cringe-worthy behaviour of Mr Bean. By comparison with him, your faux-pas is bound to look small. That’s part of the consolation of comedy. It exaggerates so much, it restores us to a sense of our own normality.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The savage comedy <em>The Thick of It</em> presents the political world as infinitely dysfunctional.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/malcolmtucker.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6529" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/malcolmtucker.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="malcolmtucker" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The characters are utterly incompetent and lost or hideously brutal. Like <em>Mr Bean</em> it presents us with a strategic exaggeration. Our tendency to despair of politics and politicians is not simply taken seriously, it is magnified and multiplied. By comparison with <em>The Thick of It,</em> actual political life looks fairly reasonable and sane. We don&#8217;t ever have to feel envious of high-ranking politicians. They are all awful, and our own lives rather nice by comparison.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to see comedy through the romantic lens of the one-off inspired comic whose unique view of the world is entertaining. But the focus on the individual witty voice misses the gigantic, political nature of the task of comedy. Comedy isn’t just a bit of fun. The comic perspective fills a central need of every society; it enables us to cope much better with our own follies and disappointments, our troubles around work and love and our difficulties enduring ourselves. Comedy is waiting to be reframed as a central tool behind the creation of a better world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At The School of Life, we are taking our first steps in comedy with these films:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">People are understandably confused about what philosophy is. From a distance, it seems weird, irrelevant, boring and yet also – just a little – intriguing. But it’s hard to put a finger on what the interest really is. What are philosophers? What do they do? And why does one need them?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Luckily, the answer is already contained in the word philosophy itself. In Greek, philo means love – or devotion – and sophia means wisdom. Philosophers are people devoted to wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2856" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sunset.jpg" alt="Visitors Enjoy The Wildlife At The Farne Islands" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though a rather abstract term, the concept of ‘wisdom’ isn’t mysterious. Being wise means attempting to live and die well, leading as good a life as possible within the troubled conditions of existence. The goal of wisdom is fulfilment. You could perhaps say ‘happiness’ but ‘happiness’ is misleading, for it suggests continuous chirpiness and joy, whereas ‘fulfilment’ seems compatible with a lot of pain and suffering, which every decent life must by necessity have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So a philosopher or ‘person devoted to wisdom’ is someone who strives for systematic expertise at working out how one may best find individual and collective fulfilment.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their pursuit of wisdom, philosophers have developed a very specific skill-set. They have, over the centuries, become experts in many of the general, large things that make people not very wise. Six central ones have been identified:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">1. We don’t ask big questions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is the meaning of life? What should I do with my work? Where are we going as a society? What is love? Most of us have these questions in our minds at some point (often in the middle of the night), but we despair of trying to answer them. They have the status of jokes in most social circles: and we get shy of expressing them (except for brief moments in adolescence) for fear of being thought pretentious and of getting nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But these questions matter deeply because only with sound answers to them can we direct our energies meaningfully.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2864" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/blinding.jpg" alt="BRITAIN-ARHCITECTURE-WEATHER" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophers are people unafraid of the large questions. They have, over the centuries, asked the very largest. They realise that these questions can always be broken down into more manageable chunks and that the only really pretentious thing is to think one is above regularly raising naive-sounding enquiries.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">2. We are vulnerable to errors of common sense</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Public opinion – or what gets called ‘common sense’ – is sensible and reasonable in countless areas. It’s what you hear about from friends and neighbours, the stuff that’s just assumed to be true, the stuff you take in without even thinking about it. The media pumps it out by the gallon every day. But in some cases, common sense is also full of daftness, error and the most lamentable prejudice.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/socrates-635x691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4490" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/socrates-635x691.jpg?resize=635%2C513" alt="Athens, Greece - 10 Mar 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy gets us to submit all aspects of common sense to reason. It wants us to think for ourselves, to be more independent. Is it really true what people say about love, about money, about children, about travel, about work? Philosophers are interested in asking whether an idea is logical – rather than simply assuming it must be right because it is popular and long-established.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">3. We are mentally confused</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re not very good at knowing what goes on in our own minds. We know we really like a piece of music. But we struggle to say quite why. Or someone we meet is very annoying, but we can’t pin down what the issue is. Or we lose our temper, but can’t readily tell what we’re so cross about. We lack insight into our own satisfactions and dislikes.</span></p>
<p class="p2">That’s why we need to examine our own minds. Philosophy is committed to self-knowledge – and its central precept – articulated by the earliest, greatest philosopher, Socrates – is just two words long: Know yourself.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">4. We have muddled ideas about what will make us happy</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re powerfully set on trying to be happy, but go wrong in our search for it on a regular basis. We overrate the power of some things to improve our lives – and underrate others. In a consumer society, we make the wrong choices because, guided by false glamour, we keep on imagining that a particular kind of holiday, or car, or computer will make a bigger difference than it can. At the same time, we underestimate the contribution of other things – like going for a walk, tidying a cupboard, having a structured conversation or going to bed early – which may have little prestige but can contribute deeply to the character of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2866" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/497348829.jpg" alt="Urban Gardening" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophers seek to be wise by getting more precise about the activities and attitudes that really can help our lives to go better.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">5. Our emotions can send us in dangerous directions</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are inescapably emotional beings but regularly forget this uncomfortable fact. Occasionally certain emotions – certain kinds of anger, envy or resentment – lead us into serious trouble. Philosophers teach us to think about our emotions, rather than simply have them. By understanding and analysing our feelings, we learn to see how emotions impact on our behaviour in unexpected, counterintuitive and sometimes dangerous ways. Philosophers were the first therapists.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">6. We panic and lose perspective</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are constantly losing a sense of what matters and what doesn’t. We are – as the expression goes – constantly ‘losing perspective’. That’s what philosophers are good at keeping a hold of. On hearing the news that he’d lost all his possessions in a shipwreck, the Stoic philosopher Zeno simply said: ‘Fortune commands me to be a less encumbered philosopher.’ It’s responses like these that have made the very term ‘philosophical’ a byword for calm, long-term thinking and strength-of-mind, in short, for perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What we call the ‘history of philosophy‘ is made up of repeated attempts over the centuries to address ways in which we are unwise. So, for example, in ancient Athens, Socrates paid special attention to the problem of how people get confused in their minds. He was struck that people didn’t quite know what they meant by key ideas – like courage or justice or success – even though these were the main ideas they used when talking about their own lives. Socrates developed a method (which still bears his name) by which you can learn to get clearer about what you mean by playing devil’s advocate with any idea. The aim isn’t necessarily to change your mind. It is to test whether the ideas guiding your life are sound.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2867" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/169994583.jpg" alt="Metropolis At The Bosporus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A few decades later, the philosopher Aristotle tried to make us more confident around big questions. He thought that the best questions were those that ask what something is for. He did this a lot and over many books, asked: What is government for? What is the economy for? What is money for? What is art for? Today he would be encouraging us to ask questions like: What is the news media for? What is marriage for? What are schools for? What is pornography for?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also active in Ancient Greece were the Stoic philosophers, who were interested in panic. The Stoics noticed a really central feature of panic: we panic not just when something bad occurs, but when it does so unexpectedly, when we were assuming that everything was going to go rather well. So they suggested that we should arm ourselves against panic by getting used to the idea that danger, trouble and difficulty are very likely to occur at every turn.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The overall task of studying philosophy is to absorb these and many other lessons and put them to work in the world today. The point isn’t just to know what this or that philosopher happened to say, but to aim to exercise wisdom at an individual and societal level – starting now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2925" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3261760103_1b9210f02b_b.jpg" alt="3261760103_1b9210f02b_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wisdom of philosophy is – in modern times – mostly delivered in the form of books. But in the past, philosophers sat in market squares and discussed their ideas with shopkeepers or went into government offices and palaces to give advice. It wasn’t abnormal to have a philosopher on the payroll. Philosophy was thought of as a normal, basic activity – rather than as an unusual, esoteric, optional extra.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nowadays, it’s not so much that we overtly deny this thought – we are always getting snippets of wisdom here and there – but we just don’t have the right institutions set up to promulgate wisdom coherently in the world. In the future, though, when the value of philosophy is a little clearer, we can expect to meet more philosophers in daily life. They won’t be locked up, living mainly in university departments, because the points at which our unwisdom bites – and messes up our lives – are multiple and urgently need attention right now.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/planes1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4494" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/planes1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="Parachute troops of the US 501st Battalion at Fort Benning, Georgia. - 1-May-1941" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you had the misfortune to do too much, or the wrong kind of it at school, you’ll probably remember one thing about history: how dull it can sometimes be. You might harbour painful memories of the Hundred Years’ War, the War of the Spanish Succession, crop rotation in the Middle Ages or – especially painful – the good deeds of Florence Nightingale.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result, it wouldn’t be surprising if – nowadays – you tended to steer well clear of the whole topic. But that would be a huge loss. The real reason why history is often so boring is that we’re not clear enough about what it should be for. Here is one big reason why history matters: it matters because it can provide us with solutions to many of the problems of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its best, history is there to introduce us to some of the things we need but that aren’t sufficiently visible in the world today. As a society, we’re obsessed by what we’re up to right now. Unknowingly, we’re hugely biased towards the present. The news – which is about the most prestigious force in the world today – circles obsessively around some of the things that have happened <b><i>in the last five minutes</i></b>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1573" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/newspaper.jpg" alt="The Christian Science Monitor Archive" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet, many of the most important things that we need to nourish, sustain and inspire us are a lot older. What we need above all else are good ideas in a range of areas that challenge us – and history is full of them. Imagine you’re dissatisfied with aspects of contemporary Capitalism. It might help hugely to read about the history of the Levellers, a group of English radicals writing and acting between 1645 and 1650. Or to learn about the medieval theory of ‘the just price’ when it comes to grasping the idea of ‘externalities’ in modern economics. Or if you question what the point of going on holiday is, you might dramatically enrich your thoughts by considering the history of pilgrimage, especially the motives which people had for trekking off to visit distant shrines. Or if you want to consider whether to get married, you should read the ideas of Mary Wollstonecraft from the 18th century or St Aquinas from the 13th century. There are so many ideas that have gone missing, wedged in the past, in volumes written long ago and not looked at in decades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1574" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1133px-DeathWatTylerFull.jpg" alt="1133px-DeathWatTylerFull" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us that things can change. People haven’t always been as they are now: materialistic and work-obsessed, unable to build nice architecture; over-concerned with being ‘connected’ or hung up on being absurdly thin. There’s an annoying saying that goes: ‘those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.’ But that suggests the only thing history is full of are mistakes. Yet it’s as fair to say: those who don’t know history won’t be able to improve the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1575" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rebellion.jpg" alt="Occupy Wall Street participants stage a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some people fall in love with periods of history, but a little too much. With a nostalgic passion. They can’t stop reading histories of World War II or of English country houses. You know the type. They’re responding to things that are missing from the present but seem not to quite know what to do about their lack. They want more Heroism and Grandeur. But they shouldn’t just be reading about it in the past, they should be using the past to figure out how a little more Heroism and Grandeur could enter life today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History teaches us courage. It’s easy to feel, when you’re pressed up against the present, that things are exceptionally awful right now. They rarely are, once you open the lens wide enough. The present is not unusual in its levels of mediocrity and compromise. Once you read the letters, the old guys were just as bad. And though our challenges are of course great, they aren’t exceptional – when compared with say, those facing the survivors of the Sack of Rome or the Lisbon earthquake.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4496" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024.jpg?resize=574%2C557" alt="Sack_of_Rome_by_the_Visigoths_on_24_August_410_by_JN_Sylvestre_1890-574x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">History ends up as a tool for the appreciation of some of our present advantages which it’s easy to miss. It can teach us to judge our society against other societies rather than against our ideals. Of course the European Union has problems, but the Habsburg Empire had them and many more. Our governments are deeply imperfect, but there have been worse. Traffic is terrible, but so was the siege of Leningrad. History can console.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting clearer about what history is for should change how the subject is taught. In the future, we should treat history a little like a doctor treats a medicine cabinet. Before diving into history, we’d first have to work out what was wrong with us, what we were lacking in the here and now. We might be diagnosed for a lack of courage, or a spoilt nature or a hesitation about whether to marry. And we should be prescribed history accordingly. History as therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For their part, historians themselves should get clearer about what problems in the present they’re trying to solve. They should explicitly aim to tell us things about the past that can help us with issues of today. Not the past for its sake, but the past for our sakes. Good history should always mean: history with solutions or consolations for today.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In almost all countries and communities around the world, there is one central (usually unvoiced) suspicion that arises whenever someone lets slip that they are ‘having therapy’: they are crazy.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Getting therapeutic help should – ideally – be an ordinary and wholly unsurprising thing, like getting a haircut or going to the dentist, but it remains a very peculiar and frowned-upon recourse. Partly, that’s because the therapeutic industry currently looks deeply unimpressive. Some rather awkward people are employed in it, operating from shabby basement offices, often with dodgy credentials. A rag bag of questionable services gets labelled with this catch-all term. An industry that should be as dominant and financially significant as Audi or Nike struggles for basic recognition. There is plenty of good work being done, but it isn’t overly visible.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2268" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/therapy.jpg" alt="Military Families Retreat Designed To Relieve Post-Combat Stress" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, because we think of therapy as an emergency procedure, something you turn to because you have very big and alarming problems, we naturally prefer to see ourselves as not needing it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet it is precisely therapy that may stop us from developing these desperate problems in the first place. ‘Seeing someone’ (as the euphemism goes) may be the strongest possible promise and indicator of sanity. It should be part of the everyday experience of everyone at large in the modern world.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2269" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/trains.jpg" alt="Internet Addiction" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are a few of the reasons why:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: A therapist can untangle our confused feelings</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thinking about lives is hard, especially in the age of the internet. There’s always a news site (or a porn film) a few clicks away, ensuring that we’re able to avoid large challenging realisations about ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may know that our career needs to change, but it rarely seems a good time to analyse how and why. Or we may feel some resentment against our partner over certain upsetting incidents, but we avoid pinning down what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. We pay a big price for such self-ignorance: countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our inner confusions. We pick the wrong job; get together with a destructive person, run away from the right one; spend our money foolishly and don’t do justice to our deeper talents and aspirations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because thinking about our lives is so hard, it helps immeasurably to think with someone else in the room, a skilled operator who can say: ‘go on… this sounds fascinating…’ – just as we were about to give up or evade an uncomfortable emotion. Their interest can sustain and guide our own; their commitment to making sense of what we’re saying and feeling gives us courage to walk further into the labyrinth of our psyches. They can do for us what no friend, however well-meaning, has the experience or patience to do: play us back to ourselves accurately, carefully and sanely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/puppet.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4498" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/puppet.jpg?resize=600%2C416" alt="Paper Face" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Therapy helps us be less defensive</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our characters are heavily buttressed by what therapists call ‘defences’: strategies to prevent us from acknowledging painful but important emotions and desires.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We like someone a lot – but out of a fear they’ll reject us – act in an aloof and sarcastic manner. Or we are deeply ambitious financially, but are so afraid of trying and failing to start a business on our own, we take it out on an abstraction we bitterly call ‘capitalism’. Or we stay at work day and night, always complaining of how busy we are, because being at the office feels more reassuring than anywhere else, for reasons that elude us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Therapy is a safe environment in which to discover more about the origins of our defences – and ideally to shed a few of them, so as to be able to lead more exposed yet more fulfilled lives. We pay too high a price for the apparent ‘safety’ of these defences: the cost of protecting ourselves in one area is always an incapacity in many others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Defensive behaviour requires therapy – rather than just a good dose of common sense – because we are sure to deny our manoeuvres if someone calls us on them in an overly direct way. It’s an arduous task marshalling our energies to address the most difficult aspects of our own behaviour. We keep on wanting to blame other people. Or run away. The therapist keeps us usefully tethered to the topic in hand, for as long as it might take for us to become a little more honest and braver with ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Therapy bolsters a sane inner voice</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the course of our lives, we will without doubt be exposed to a cast of terrible role models – and are at risk of internalising their unhelpful – but potent – approaches to life. The critical, snide remarks of a gang from school get lodged in our imaginations, so that we keep hearing echoes of their corrosive (but to us compelling) commentaries decades thereafter. Our harassed, rushed mother who couldn’t give us enough attention at key moments thirty-five years ago becomes our imaginary template of all intimate communication: people only half listen to one another, they always have more important things to do than spend time with us… Or it could be a splenetic father, who was never much impressed with us, from whom we internalise the idea that authority figures are always critically looking to see where we have fallen short.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2271" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tears.jpg" alt="People. Children. Boys. pic: 1940's. Three schoolboys in long socks, short trousers, blazers and caps &quot;poke fun&quot; at another boy's dress sense." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These punitive, debilitating voices push us towards unhelpful ways of interpreting our own experience. I am disgusting, we tell ourselves. In our minds, we hear: of course, I failed. Obviously that person wouldn’t be interested in me. I’ve got no chance. I’ve got to leave the living room spotless – only the worst possible people would ever leave things until the morning. Only a deranged person would want to think of that during sex…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the key tasks of the therapist is to expose us often enough to a more sane, respectful, reasonable and realistic outlook than our own. The hope is that we will not for ever have to rely on their presence. A good version of the earlier damaging process of internalisation can ideally occur. The therapist’s kindly, wise voice should become our own. We should begin to intuit what they would have said in a given situation, and when they are no longer there, at moments of crisis and loneliness, can learn to say some of the important, calming and kind things to ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Therapy helps couples hear one another</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Relationships can descend into shouting matches. Both parties are furious and out to wound, yet both are also too hurt to listen. In such chaotic situations, a therapist can become the wise broker, allowing each person to have their say, sympathising with both parties, while taking neither of their sides. Therapy becomes a safe diplomatic back channel, away from the open warfare of domestic life. The therapist can help the couple to see that behind one person’s rage is pain and a history of betrayal. Or she might make someone aware of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of hostile silence or controlling inquisitions. She can hold both parties back from one another’s throats for just long enough that they may start to understand what their previously caricatured opponent is going through.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It could all seem far from romantic, but if by romantic one means committed to the development and growth of love, then there can be nothing more romantic than to pour over a couple’s resentments – before these have corroded all capacities for desire and tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> * *</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Far from a self-indulgence, undergoing therapy is one of the most generous things we could ever do for all those who have to live around us. Those who have spent time in therapy are, if the process has worked even moderately well, ever so slightly less dangerous to be around: a little better able to warn those who depend on them of how frustrating and peculiar they might sometimes be. We owe it to ourselves, and just as importantly, those who love us, to take our courage in our hands – and to go and ‘see someone’ forthwith.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">People look at one strangely if one makes a trip to the zoo without a child. Ideally one should have a gang of children, evidence of dribbled ice-cream and some balloons as well. Contemplating enclosures with oriental small-clawed otters or leopard geckos hardly seems an adult way to pass the afternoon. The elegant question in London at the moment is whether one has caught the German Renaissance show at the National Gallery, not the impressive new pygmy hippo at Regent’s Park Zoo.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4501" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooA.jpg?resize=635%2C540" alt="Zsl London Zoo's New A2.3 Million Children's Zoo - Animal Adventure - Is Designed To Get Children As Young As Three Interested In Animals. Sam Sherwood Age 5 From The Gower Primary School Islington Gets To Watch A Meerkat From Inside A Perspex Bubb" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But if one’s five year old nephew pulls out at the last minute (he’d remembered it was his best friend’s birthday), then one might stubbornly decide to go through with an afternoon at the zoo any way. The first simple thought is how strange animals look. Apart from the odd cat, dog or horse, it may be years since one has seen a real animal, an extraordinary, jungle-bookish sort of creature. Take the camel: a u-shaped neck, two furry pyramids, eyelashes that seem coated in mascara, and a set of yellow buck teeth. There is a guide on hand with some facts: camels can go ten days in the desert without drinking, their humps aren’t filled with water, it’s fat, the eyelashes are designed to keep out sandstorms, and their liver and kidneys extract all moisture from food, leaving their dung dry and compact.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1903" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooB.jpg" alt="London Zoo annual stocktake, London, Britain - 04 Jan 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If creatures end up looking so strange, it’s all because of their adaptations to the peculiarities of the natural environment, Darwin taught us, and no one would doubt it in Regent’s Park. The Sri Lankan Sloth bear has long, mobile lips and two missing upper incisors so that it can suck ants and termites out of their nests, a distinctive facial feature which no one who relied on a more conventional diet would have bothered with.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every creature seems wonderfully adapted for some things, hopelessly suited for others. The horseshoe crab looks monstrous, like a miniature military helmet with bow legs, but it’s a pro at surviving in deep water and avoiding the appetites of sharks. It lives quietly, without incident, sliding only occasionally across the ocean floor to grab the odd mollusc.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1904" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooC.jpg" alt="Zsl London Zoo's New A2.3 Million Children's Zoo - Animal Adventure - Is Designed To Get Children As Young As Three Interested In Animals. Sam Sherwood Age 5 And Lottie Kendall Age 5 Watches The Porcupines At The Animal Adventure Experience At Lond" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s hard not to land on particular creatures in which one sees aspects of one’s own character. In his letters, Gustave Flaubert compared himself variously to a boa constrictor (1841), an oyster in its shell (1845), and a hedgehog rolling up to protect itself (1853, 1857). One might come away identifying with the Malayan tapir, the baby okapi, the llama and the turtle (especially on sombre Sunday evenings).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1905" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280214-zooD.jpg" alt="Zsl London Zoo. The Penguins At London Zoo. 4 Penguins Have Reportedly Died After Catching A Deadly Strain Of Malaria. There Was No Sign Of Any Ill Looking Penguins At Feeding And None Of The Staff Mentioned Anything About The Disease." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A zoo unsettles in simultaneously making animals seem more human and humans more animal. “Apes are man’s closest relative,” reads a characteristically chirpy caption by the orang-outang enclosure, “how many similarities can you see?” Far too many for comfort, of course. Shave him, dress him in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, and the one scratching his nose in the corner of the cage might be a cousin. In May 1842, Queen Victoria visited Regent’s Park Zoo, and in her diary, noted of a new Orang Outang from Calcutta: “He is wonderful, preparing and drinking his tea, but he is painfully and disagreeably human.” How easily one can imagine being captured and placed in a cage-like room in a Holiday Inn, with three meals a day passed through a hatch, and with nothing to do other than watch TV – while a crowd of giraffes look on at one, giggling and videoing, licking confectionery, while saying what a short neck one has.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4500" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280214-zooE.jpg?resize=635%2C464" alt="Zsl London Zoo Conduct Their Annual Weigh-in Where All The Zoo's Animals Are Measured And Weighed. The Giraffes Masure Up Against The Wall Chart." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Outside the zoo, so much of what one does starts to assume animal-like tendencies. Calling up that friend for a drink; just part of the mating ritual of the species, not fundamentally different from what llamas are up to when they start to whistle strangely at each other on long autumn nights on the Peruvian plains.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then again, there is relief to be found in the ability to view one’s antics as manifestations of basic animal drives; for food, shelter and survival of one’s genetic offspring.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One should never wait for the excuse of a child to go to the zoo.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Having a decent conversation is something most of us imagine we can do without any problem – and certainly without much thought. These things just happen naturally. Don’t they?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in truth, truly good conversations come along very rarely; largely because our societies fall for the Romantic myth that knowing how to talk to other people is something we are born knowing how to do, rather than an art dependent on a little planning and a few skills. We rightly accept that total improvisation in preparing a meal is unlikely to yield good outcomes; but we show no such caution or modesty when it comes to how we might talk over the food once it has been made. Finding oneself in a good conversation can feel as haphazard and random as stumbling on a beautiful square in a foreign city at night ­– and realising one won’t reliably know how to get back there in daytime.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2336" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/483000331.jpg" alt="New York Culinary Experience Private Dinner Featuring Chefs David Bouley, Daniel Rose, And David Waltuck Hosted By New York Magazine Culinary Editor Gillian Duffy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The search for better conversations should begin with the question of what a conversation is ideally for. And here two basic functions suggest themselves: confirmation and clarification.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The official story of what life is like leaves out a daunting amount about who we really are. Too much of what we feel can’t normally be disclosed for fear that we’ll be humiliated or cause undue alarm or upset. Our envy of colleagues, our disappointments in love, our true feelings towards our families, our embarrassing habits and petty fears, our wilder political daydreams… little of this ‘silent normality’ has the chance to be discussed; until we find ourselves in a good conversation, by which is meant a conversation that – artfully, without prurience or judgement – manages to confirm the fundamental acceptability of hitherto carefully guarded emotions and ideas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28645111.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4503" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/28645111.jpg?resize=635%2C547" alt="Peeping Tom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Shyness takes a lot of the blame for poor conversations. We get scared of opening our souls because we falsely exaggerate the difference between ourselves and others. We display only our strengths, vaunt only our successes, lay out only our conventional proposals – and bore others as a result because it is in the revelation of our weaknesses, in the display of our fragilities, in the confession of our wilder fantasies that we grow interesting and likeable. It is almost impossible to be bored when a person tells you sincerely what they have failed at or who has humiliated them, what they long for and when they have been at their craziest.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2340" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3333684.jpg" alt="London Coffee Bar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then come the pleasures of clarification, conversations in which another person sharpens our ideas by correcting our tendencies to mental blankness and distraction. Thinking alone is hard, our minds jump away from the pressure to bring ideas into focus, preferring the charm of daydreaming or the internet instead. How helpful, therefore, to be able to embark on the job of thinking with someone who can hold us to the issues we need to refine, lend us courage to keep going with our hesitant opening thoughts and pollinate our analyses with their insights.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In too many countries, a misplaced fear of ‘pretension’ holds people back from raising the large rewarding topics – as though only very special people had the right to consider head on what it really means to be human. But is permission necessary to probe at the central assumptions of human life? When else are we meant to ask: What is the point of work? What makes a good relationship? How are we to raise children? What should we travel for? What should our nations be?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should be braver and more demanding about the conversations we fall into. Rather than seeing successful examples as a gift, we should strive to become their regular engineers and cultivators.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">Miranda Kerr is pretty, successful and very rich. She’s been named the sexiest woman alive. She’s also deeply interested in developing her mind. That means she’s into yoga, chanting, meditation and Japanese Buddhism. She recites Nam Myoho Renge Kyo twice a day – invoking the mystic law of the lotus flower which asserts that Miranda and the cosmos are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-250314-kerrA.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4505" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-250314-kerrA.png?resize=455%2C408" alt="PM-250314-kerrA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kerr has had some real difficulties with loneliness and loss. Her first boyfriend died in a car crash. A later lover turned out to be a crook. She married Orlando Bloom but it all fell apart pretty quickly. Her needs are real. And she’s turned for comfort and help to the East.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">She might have looked elsewhere. She might have found that Plato or Tolstoy had things to teach her. Maybe she could have been touched by Bach or medieval architecture. It’s not as if the West doesn’t also have a deep and long engagement with the sorrows of life. But, like so many spiritually curious people, she didn’t end up engaging with its culture. Instead she joined the Soka Gakkai Buddhist movement. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda is deeply sincere in her longing to be educated and instructed. She’s a tireless advocate of an analysed life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So how has it happened that Western culture largely passed Miranda by? It’s not her fault. She needed something and the West wouldn’t give it to her. So she went elsewhere. And her decision tells us something hugely important about how the Western world handles – or more accurately, mishandles – its culture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2059" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrB.jpg?resize=601%2C367" alt="PM-250314-kerrB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The philosophers at Sydney University have priorities beyond Miranda Kerr&#8217;s inner life &#8211; sadly.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda was bothered that her life felt empty and pointless. But in her home town of Sydney, all the professors in the university’s humanities department were busy with other things. For example, the philosophy department (a natural place one might go to in search of wisdom and consolation) was trying to define ontological naturalism, situate Wittgenstein in his proper historical perspective, footnote a volume of late Heidegger and compare Plato’s Phaedrus with Aristotle’s Ethics. It’s not a bad way to spend the time, but it isn’t – arguably – very helpful to anyone with anything resembling a real problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, Sydney University is not unusual. It’s the same from New Zealand to New Mexico. Academic institutions have turned culture – which should help us to live and die well – into abstract scholarship.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buddhist sects are not like this. They’re on a mission to help you to find your way through the challenges of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2060" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg?resize=507%2C339" alt="200364690-008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">They’re into Buddhism too</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda is not alone by any means. It would be extremely strange to hear at a middle-class dinner party that the person next to you had found solace in Hegel or Aristotle. And totally unsurprising to learn that they had been to Nepal and were entranced by its traditional wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda was ready for guidance. She wanted someone to explain what you need to do to steer a path through life. And, because of certain deep prejudices against the idea of being useful, Western culture let her down.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2062" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-250314-kerrD.jpg" alt="PM-250314-kerrD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, for example, is ‘star’ academic philosopher Derek Parfit in action: “An act is wrong if and only if, or just when, such acts are disallowed by some principle that is one of the principles whose being universal laws would make things go best, one of the only principles whose being universal laws everyone could rationally will… or a principle that no one could reasonably reject.” One has to be ready for this, and many &#8211; indeed most &#8211; are not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Miranda’s rejection of the West is the West’s fault. She needed help and none was given. This isn’t just a problem for one very famous model, it’s a problem for all of us, in the East and in the West. We are missing out on a crucial resource. The great figures of Western culture almost all wanted culture to function as an instrument for the pursuit of a wiser life: Socrates, Epicurus, Seneca, Montaigne, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Schiller, Tolstoy, Proust… all wanted culture to be not an object of academic study, but a living resource that could offer counsel and direction (for when a boyfriend had been killed) – much as the Eastern ‘wisdom tradition’ has always believed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s time to return Western culture to its rightful ambitions, not in order to win out over the East, but in order to stand as its legitimate equal in the pursuit of a path to human flourishing.</span></p>
