				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays we’re used to thinking of travel as the ‘fun’ bit of life, but enjoyment isn’t a reason why it shouldn’t also do some very serious things for us. At its deepest level, travel can assist us with our psychological education. It can – when approached the right way – play a critical role in helping us to grow into better versions of our normal selves. When it corrects the imbalances and immaturities of our natures, travel reveals its full potential to function as a form of therapy in our lives.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But in order to work a therapeutic effect, we need to change how we go about choosing our destinations. We should recognise that we’re badly served here by the travel industry, which cuts the world up into material categories almost entirely unattuned to the needs of our souls. It will lay before us options like ‘outdoor fun,’ ‘family adventure’ ‘culture weekends’ or ‘island hideaways’ – but leave it unexplored quite what the point of these destinations might be when considered from the point of view of our psyches.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-882" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/1489435532.jpg" alt="Paris Plage 2012 Official Launch" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Without anything mystical being meant by it, all of us are involved in one way or another on what could be termed ‘an inner journey’: that is, we’re trying to develop in particular ways. We might be searching for how to be calmer or how to find a way to rethink our goals, we might long for a greater sense of confidence or an escape from debilitating feelings of envy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Ideally, where we go should help us with our attempts at these longed-for pieces of psychological evolution. The outer journey should assist us with the inner one. But for this to happen, we need to be clearer in our minds both what we’re searching for inside and what the outer world could conceivably deliver for us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In part, this requires us to look at the globe in a new way. Every destination we might alight upon contains within it qualities, virtues one might say, that could conceivably support some move or other on a person’s inner journey. There are places that could help with shyness and others with anxiety. Some places might be good at reducing egoism and others might be good for helping us think more clearly about the future.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-875" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/450362875.jpg" alt="General Views of Arena Pantanal &amp; Surrounding Areas - FIFA World Cup Venues Brazil 2014" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">No one has yet written a psychological atlas of the world, outlining the so-called psychological virtues of places, but it’s a project that urgently needs to be undertaken. Such an atlas would align destinations with their inner potential. For example, we’d see that the Utah desert is both a physical destination – made up of 200 million-year-old stones that stretch out as far as the eye can see in a soothing pink hue – and a psychological one: capable of functioning as a goad to perspective, an aide to shift away from preoccupations with the petty and the small-minded towards a terrain of greater calm and resilience.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In the future, we would ideally be more conscious travellers – aware that we were on a search for places that could deliver psychological virtues like ‘calm’ or ‘perspective,’ ‘sensuality’ or ‘rigour’. A visitor to Monument Valley wouldn’t just be in it for a bit of undefined ‘adventure’, something to enjoy and then gradually forget about two weeks later; travelling to the place would be an occasion fundamentally to reorient one’s personality. It would be the call-to-arms to become a different person; an 8,000 mile, £3,000 secular pilgrimage that would be properly anchored around a piece of profound character development.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-876" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/179800813.jpg" alt="Utah, Church Rock at junction of US Route 191 and Utah Route 211 the entrance to the Needles section of Canyon lands National Park" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Travel should not be allowed to escape the underlying seriousness of the area of life with which it deals. We need always to aim for locations in the outer world that can push us towards where we need to go within.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the coming two weeks, we are leaving the office to send you ‘postcards’ from a variety of locations around the world that will demonstrate the theory of ‘travel as therapy’ in action – and hopefully inspire you on therapeutic journeys of your own.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You are – quite literally – in the middle of nowhere – and, unexpectedly, it’s helping. A lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How frantic we otherwise normally are. We live competitive crazed lives: we compare ourselves constantly to those who have more, are smarter, seem more organised, look younger…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are so many reasons to be frantic, and yet – as we know in our hearts – it is even more of a priority to keep an occasional appointment with someone we neglect in our normal madness – a deeper, quieter part of ourselves. We have intimations of it at night, on the motorway or in the grey stillness of the early morning. And we feel it strongly here, deep in Navajo land, on the Utah-Arizona border.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It seems everything we do matters so much but, here, we listen to a different, more humbling message: that everything we do and are is in truth meaningless – when considered from a sufficient distance, from the perspective of the timeless stones, the boundless vistas, the infinite heavens.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To counter our tendencies to exaggerate and panic, we need only meditate on our utter insignificance when measured against aeons of time and space. It was two hundred million years ago that the Triassic seas retreated, and the land rose up to became a high desert plateau that wind and rain have slowly, ever so slowly eroded. Harder capstones gradually emerged, protecting the rock below, to form the slender pinnacles, or buttes, and wider mesas of Monument Valley.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is baking hot here during the day. The air is thin. It is a place resolutely indifferent to our lives. Here one does not matter; it is obvious – in a quiet, not-unkind way that one’s life is a tiny thing. The desert provides a needed, strategic renewal of perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Beyond the dramatic pillars of rock the empty, very slightly undulating table extends into infinity without any mark of mankind. A light haze builds at the horizon. Banks of distant cloud are touched with pink and gold as the sun starts to go down, the horizontal rays of the sun setting the upright bands of sandstone alight. The ego is loosened, forgets itself.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert rehearses in grand terms a lesson that ordinary life typically introduces viciously; that the universe is mightier than we are, that we are frail and temporary and have no alternative but to accept the limitations on our will; that we must bow to necessities greater than ourselves. This is the lesson written into the stones and the red sands. But so grandly is it written here that we can come away from the desert, not crushed, but inspired by what lies beyond us; privileged to be subject to such majestic necessities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We have not only travelled to a place, we have heard the whispers, across an ochre wasteland, of a philosophy of wisdom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the first day, it was difficult. You went into the corner shop just off the main Motomachi shopping street to buy a prepaid mobile card. You pointed at your phone, you pretended to make a call. It was useless. Mr Nishimura couldn’t understand you at all. You were hot and flustered (it was 86°F and pretty humid). You felt such an idiot.</span></p>
<p class="p2">It was eerily familiar: like the time at school you were supposed to make a speech and your mind went totally blank; the painful evenings at college when everybody else seemed to be heading off somewhere and you weren’t sure if you could ask to join in.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Over the years, at home, you have learned how to avoid many of the situations that you find so awkward (though other people appear to manage them without the slightest concern). Most of the time, you can work round the diffidence and fear of being the unwelcome focus of attention, what at certain moments you call your shyness. When something feels alien or in any way threatening your instinct is to retreat. You’d never ask a stranger for directions in the street; the idea of going up to a group of people you don’t know at a party is terrifying. But now you are beginning to tire of the downside of this survival tactic: the too high price it extracts.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In Japan everything is, to you, foreign. You of course can’t know what you are supposed to do. You are so far from being inconspicuous, it’s a joke. Shyness is in a way no longer even an option. You are already so far off the deep end.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">So you go back to the shop. You make use of the ATM (which has an English language option). You buy some wasabi flavoured crisps and give the man a big smile. He grins back. You’re learning to be a little more confident.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are learning how to do something: you’re learning to overcome, not just work round, your shyness. A holiday that immerses you in a life entirely different to your normal routine is the ideal setting to exercise what is really a skill (though we tend to see it as a piece of good or bad luck). You didn’t book into a big chain hotel. You’ve rented an apartment near the wonderful Sankeien Gardens from a really nice guy called Kazutaka.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Today you bought a packet of Chokobi mini star-shaped chocolate biscuits. You made a joke about the rain. You said ‘ame desu’ – which you’d practiced after breakfast and hopefully means something like ‘it’s raining’  &#8211; and gestured drolly at your wet hair. Mr Nishimura beamed at you. It’s a deep corrective. Your uncle who was so hard to please was not normal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You are strengthening a capacity you need back in the rest of your life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-937" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Utrecht-cafe.jpg" alt="Utrecht-cafe" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">August is perfect for sitting outside at the Café de Zaak in the Korte Minrebroederstraat. The decent beers on tap, plus a generous bring-your-own-meal policy make this one of the nicest cafes in town.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If one’s honest, there are really some very intriguing locals here. Floris has just asked if you’d like a mushroom Bitterballen and Saartje is encouraging you to try the latest Pure Noodzaak. There’s someone you like the look of sitting by the window, reading a paperback by Marion Bloem. Maybe you could end up in their bed tonight. It’s not something you’d necessarily rush to tell your colleagues or your parents: but it’s true. Your unconscious knows it. You realise that without quite accepting the fact, you have come to Utrecht as a sex tourist.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sex tourism sounds horribly sleazy, deeply pathetic and beyond the pale. We associate it (in its poshest guise) with a rich Western man, an uptight, over cerebral, metropolitan character, finding despicable release in the cheaper brothels of the third world. Sex tourism means self-indulgence and exploitation. No one can remotely deny that such things are vile. But to say that all sex abroad is always repugnant is to miss (for very understandable reasons) the more constructive possibilities which lurk in the vicinity of the term sex tourism: the possibility of getting closer to a nation and its virtues by sleeping with a local person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why would one even seek to do so? Because we are all inevitably a bit unbalanced. The course of life makes all of us excessively one thing or another; misanthropic or gregarious, competitive or too fearful of rivals, too focused on money or overly carefree… A search for the missing parts of ourselves – for the dispositions which will balance us and allow us to grow more complete – often feeds a desire to travel to a particular place. The uptight person may seek a Latin country. The slightly chaotic one feels drawn to the virtues of a northern Protestant land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Netherlands has developed a national talent for ambitious ordinariness. Dutch culture is very keen to stress human equality. Yet its image of what it is to be ‘average’ or ‘ordinary’ is stylish and sophisticated. It’s ordinary to ride a bike wearing a big floppy hat and to take a peek at a poetry book by Herman Gorter at the lights. It’s ordinary to keep your house immaculately tidy. Liking Spinoza’s philosophy doesn’t feel more posh than supporting Ajax or Feyenoord. Psychologically, the Netherlands is the national home of a crucial, elusive combination: dignity and equality. We already have an intuitive sense that the Dutch (like so many other nations) can offer us something we need.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The real question is: how does one access it and make it one’s own?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our cultural traditions suggest we should visit museums. That’s always where we’re meant to go in order to sense and imbibe the national spirit; in order to be educated. But many of us wind up at the Rijksmuseum more from lack of imagination than any real interest in de Hooch or Van Ruysdael.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In truth, the virtues of the Netherlands are better found in the people, not in the art. But a chat over a beer might not be quite enough. There might be other, more committed places to explore national identity and virtue: in the bedroom. So what’s needed now (and what the Café de Zaak may provide, especially if one dares to say hello to someone soon) is the most potent educational force known to humankind: the brief affair abroad, in a country one deeply admires.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been in the air for 12 hours. Now this anonymous box. It was your company’s idea. You’d have a chance to sleep a little, then catch the next 11 hour flight, before heading straight into the conference.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’ve been assigned a room at the top western corner of the building from which you can see one side of a terminal and a sequence of red and white lights that mark the end of a runway. Every minute, despite the best attempts of the glazing contractors, you hear the roar of an ascending jet, as hundreds of passengers, some perhaps holding their partners’ hands, others sanguinely scanning <i>The Economist</i>, head out over the Straits of Singapore.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re hungry and hunt out the room service menu. ‘Pacific snapper, enhanced with lemon pepper seasoning atop a chunky mango relish.’ The always dour ‘Chef’s soup of the day’. But perhaps, in the end, there’s never an alternative to the Club Sandwich, which you’ve never eaten anywhere but in places like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a knock at the door twenty minutes later. It is a strange moment when two adults meet each other, one naked save for a complimentary dressing gown, the other (newly arrived in Singapore from the little village of Ujung Batu in Indonesia and sharing a room with four others near the sports stadium), sporting a black and white uniform, with an apron and name badge. It is difficult to think of the ritual as entirely unremarkable, to say in a casually impatient voice, ‘By the television, please,’ while pretending to rearrange papers – though this capacity can be counted upon to evolve with more frequent attendance at global conferences.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You have dinner with Chloe Cho, formerly with CNBC, now working for Channel NewsAsia in Singapore. She updates you on the regional markets and Samsung’s quarterly forecast. You wonder what Chloe’s outside interests might be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s impossible to get to sleep. The prehistoric part of your mind, trained to listen for and interpret every shriek in the trees, is still doing its work, latching on to the slamming of doors and the flushing of toilets in unknown precincts of the building. The sky is a chemical orange colour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being unable to sleep night after night, for weeks on end, is – of course – hell. But in smaller doses, insomnia in a lonely foreign hotel does not need a cure. It’s an asset with some key troubles of the soul. Crucial things you need to think about get a chance to unfold here. During the day, back home, you are dutiful to others, you’re part of a team of thirty. The emails come in by the dozen every ten minutes. Here, for once, in this box at the end of a long corridor, you can return to a bigger duty: to yourself.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The hotel on the edge of the runway is a corrective to the demands of the community, to the inability to think in the normal press of the day. It’s like a monastery in the times of old. You can turn things over. The thoughts of this long night would sound weird to your partner, your friends, your children. These people need you to be a certain way. They cannot tolerate all your possibilities and desires – and for some good reasons. You don’t want to let them down; they have a right to benefit from your predictability. But their expectations choke off important aspects of who you are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, in this endless night by the airport, with the window open and a clearing sky above, it is just you, the universe and an A380 on its final approach from Dubai.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the rush of the day, there is no time for the higher-order questions: where is my career going? How come there is so little tenderness in my relationship? How could I reconnect with my kids? What do I really want from this brief life?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be turning over such issues and yet to feel like a mere beginner is worrying, but you go with it nevertheless. You’re taking notes on the hotel pad. You have the protection of the night and of a foreign land where no one knows of you or cares about you in the slightest. You could disappear here and hardly leave a trace.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You are naturally very inclined to want to be normal. Yet thanks to this insomnia, you are granted a crucial encounter with your weirder, truer self. The daytime-office you is a misleading picture of what you’re like. This insomnia is a gift, and this horrid lonely over-priced hotel its precious, unexpected guardian.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-902" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Easton_Theatre_Panorama_F1.jpg" alt="Easton_Theatre_Panorama_F1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It would be unusual today to find a travel agent recommending a sojourn in Detroit as the ideal vacation. The city is, after all, in decline. There are neighbourhoods full of derelict homes, there are shattered theatres and ruined office buildings that were thriving only a few decades ago.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the idea of going there is far from unreasonable. It has long been fashionable to visit ruins – but only of a very special kind. Announcing you are off on holiday to see what is left of ancient Ephesus, near Izmir on Turkey’s Aegean coast, will raise no eyebrows. We understand that contemplating the beautiful remains of the Library of Celsus can put one in touch with the instability of all human achievement. In its day, the Library at Ephesus must have seemed indestructible. Now we know what can happen to the finest long-term ambitions and the melancholy, bracing truth – hopefully – hits home. We become, in our own lives, more conscious that time is fleeting, that we must not count on the future, that we cannot count on endless good fortune. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But time dulls the power of the message. The idea that a civilisation lasted a mere seven hundred years before collapsing is not – if one is honest – a terribly disturbing thought. The thought that Piccadilly Circus might have only another 537 years to go, or that by 2714, Tate Modern will be buried under sand, does not freeze the soul or force a radical reassessment of life. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why one should head for West Oakman Boulevard or East English Village to contemplate contemporary ruins. Less than ten years ago, these places were filled with hope and life; couples were excitedly choosing paint for the nursery; people were planting trees and upgrading their heating system; they were looking forward to the future. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You should perhaps attend an auction at which a house that would be greatly prized if it was located in Putney or Morningside is sold for a hundred dollars. It has, effectively, no financial value. It has fallen off the edge of the economic universe.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The point of such travel is not to make us downcast. It is, rather, to make us attend to the fragility of life. We do not know what five years will bring. The fascinating classical remains in Turkey elegantly preach a lesson about history. Detroit offers a crash course in short-term error. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-899" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/BDP1DE.jpg" alt="Pumping station near Isla Mayor, Seville, Spain" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many guide books suggesting what you might do when you get to Seville. But they all pretty much agree that you must go both to the Plaza de España, built for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929, and then to the Alcázar – a beautiful Moorish fort which subsequently became a royal palace. There’s also the cathedral and the art museum. If you have extra time, you should go to the flamenco dance museum, visit the Torre del Oro by the river and stroll through the old streets of the Santa Cruz neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Such lists are inadvertent but powerful agents of snobbery. The guide book is today’s equivalent of Debrett’s Peerage and Baronetage, which a smart person might have consulted in 1805 to identify who was worth visiting in Hampshire.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The list of locations to view carries within it a variety of assumptions about what makes something worthwhile: it should ideally be long-standing; it should have prestigious links to art, religion and royalty; and literary associations are always a plus (all visitors to Seville are strongly advised to see the monument to Cervantes, author of Don Quixote, located on the Plaza de América).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Snobbery exploits a natural frailty of our nature: an insecurity about deciding what matters to us, and an accompanying meek assumption that whatever is important or valuable must already have been discovered by others and have achieved widespread prestige. Snobbery emerges out of excessive loyalty to established status, whether laid down by Debrett’s or the apparently (but only apparently) more independent-minded TripAdvisor. Travel snobbery slyly assumes that only people or things which come with a particular kind of endorsement could have any importance for us. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We shouldn’t feel unusually stupid about this. It’s not an exceptional curse. We are all prone to snobbery, not in terms of seeking invitations to A-list parties, but in the wider and more important sense that we develop prejudices about where beauty, interest, intelligence and sensitivity are likely to turn up – based on the verdicts of certain established voices of authority. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But as we travel, inside of us, we may register a lot of latent interests that aren’t mentioned in any tourist offices, yet that we might profitably take time to explore, if only we could overcome ‘guidebook guilt’. We might, for example, deep inside be far more curious about how local supermarkets operate than in the legacy of Cervantes. Or we might find ourselves thinking a lot more about local attitudes to cars than about Velázquez.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or imagine if in our hearts what we’re really struck by in Seville is the sheer dryness of the landscape and the challenges of pumping water into the city and its surrounding villages. What a feat of engineering must be going on in the background, just to ensure that our shower at the Hotel Don Paco sends out its comforting, powerful spray with such reliability twice a day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hydro engineering never appears in any guidebook, it just doesn’t fit assumptions about what deserves prestige (though in the 18th century, no visit to a city was complete without a tour of the waterworks). However, what pleasure we might experience if we courageously took a day off from the tyranny of museums and monuments and headed south, on the A8053, to the village of Isla Mayor – in order to visit the stunning nearby Salina Grande pumping station.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pumping station is on no must-see list. It has never been invited to a smart party.  But the gargantuan stark structure is a key part of a major irrigation system which has turned former marshland into rice fields. It hums modestly yet powerfully. There are 25 separate turbines inside, each made by the German engineering company Siemens, masterpieces of rational thought and discipline. If you get there early, you might see a Griffon vulture warming its wings on the parapet in the morning sun. There are a few large, isolated cork oak trees nearby. It’s a beautifully desolate place. It’s also, as much as a cathedral, an emblem of civilisation: a location where an intense, strategic intelligence has overcome the limitations of nature, harnessed the earth and brought fertility and sweetness to millions (it is because of the station that the famous Seville oranges can flourish). The station is moving in its lack of pride: it works mutely, unknown, through the night, across the parched summer days, making sure the groves will survive the arid months, guaranteeing that those tourists will have enough water for their showers when they return from the dusty Plaza de España.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might not be a pumping station that, in the end, does it for you. But all of us have equivalents. Things we care about that aren’t mentioned anywhere. Private interests that we don’t explore, simply because they aren’t generally spoken about, they don’t feel normal enough.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Originality only begins when we dare to be thought a little mad, when we allow our curiosity to be spontaneous, when we undertake the heroic effort of worrying a little less what the crowd and the guidebooks will think. Part of growing up, and learning to travel well, means daring to take our own interests a bit more seriously.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-896" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/493651173.jpg" alt="COLOMBIA-ELECTION-SECURITY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Groups of young men armed with planks of wood roam the alleyways extorting money. Houses are made of bits of tin, old doors, the occasional lump of concrete, oil drums and tarpaulin sheets. Sofa carcasses thrown onto rubbish tips in the first world are covered in strips of office carpet. Open sewers, choked with filth, run between houses. People spend their days picking up refuse in a gigantic dump. This is Comuna 13 in the San Javier district of Medellín (the second-largest city in Colombia): an ideal holiday destination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the 18th century, successful young men went on Grand Tours to complete their education.  They travelled to Venice, Florence, Rome and Naples and looked at pictures and statues from the Renaissance and the Ancient World. Their journeys were based on an idea that what their participants most lacked, and might most severely be undermined by lacking, was high culture. They had to undertake such journeys – they needed to know about Titian and Veronese and key moments in Roman history – in order to become fully human. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This distinctive theory has had a huge impact. It explains why, at most times of year, the Uffizi in Florence and the Villa Borghese in Rome are packed. We remain the heirs of the notion that high culture is necessary to complete us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there are, in truth, a great many other things we may lack as badly. Most of us are continually disenchanted with our circumstances. It seems impossible not to keep thinking about the people one envies, the ones who made it big. Our countries appear to be intolerably badly managed, dispiriting and coarse. The new supermarkets are unsightly and there’s nothing uplifting on television. There seems so little to be grateful for from day-to-day.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That is why we need, perhaps more urgently than we need to go to Florence, to take a trip to Comuna 13. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course we know, in theory, that we’re lucky, all of us in the first world; we’ve known it ever since we were intimidated into finishing what was on our plates by tales of malnourished children in foreign lands. But it’s really only when one spends one’s first night in Comuna 13 that the truth starts to sink in. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are no street lamps. Girls of 12 are selling themselves on street corners. The police will rob and possibly rape you. Guns go off hourly. If there is a fire, no fire engines can get to the scene; everything is burned. A gash on the leg from a ragged piece of metal or a sliver of broken glass can prove fatal. Your food has shit in it. If you are seriously ill; you die. A luxury would be a biro, some toothpaste, a clean sheet, a door with a lock.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comuna 13 is an education in appreciation. Like many great art works in elegant galleries, it teaches us to see – and admire &#8211;  things we have scarcely noticed before – except it does it with rather more conviction and lasting impact than a work by Vermeer or Jasper Johns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">An 18th-century aristocrat would typically bring home a painting or a statue as a memento of their Grand Tour. They would put it in a prominent place at home: above the fireplace or in the hallway, so that they would see it everyday and so that the lessons of the trip would be kept fresh. Today, on returning from a week’s stay in Comuna 13, one might keep a bit of corrugated iron or a photo of the rain flooding straight through the roof of Eliana and Camilo’s one-room home, soaking them and their three young children to the bone</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/birmingham4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4542" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/birmingham4.jpg?resize=635%2C330" alt="birmingham4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Abroad is, as we know, the exciting bit. You’ve been so far recently. You were in Abuja only on Tuesday and then at Heathrow on Wednesday. Yesterday lunchtime, you were having fried plantain in the Wuse district with Promise and Chinwe, and at eight this morning, the captain closed down the 777′s twin engines at a gate in Terminal 5 across from a branch of Costa Coffee.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re back home in Birmingham now. Midway down Glenpark Road, around the corner from West End Park. How peculiar and depressing everything looks against the memory of dawn in the Obudu hills. How sad the dampness of the English climate after the intense West African light. How drearily English, in a way they will never know, the chat of the neighbours out in the road when you have the din of the street market in Kubwa still ringing in your ears.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why does ‘home’ so often have to be the boring bit? Seated together on most planes is a mixture of people with such different expectations of where they are going: those for whom this will be the start of a journey to a new land, and those returning home. The first group is filled with excitement, they have guidebooks, cameras and knots of anticipation. The second may be too sad to touch their inflight trays. On the final descent, they gaze at the landscape with melancholy faces. They have only home to contemplate, with its banal associations. And yet the two groups are travelling to the very same place. Once they have crossed customs, they will have before them the very same monuments, museums, landscapes and foods.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we accord such privileges to foreign places, and such ready disdain for our own lands? Would it not be one of the greatest skills, the most helpful kind of practical wisdom, to know how to sample a little of the excitement about our own countries that foreigners know how to locate here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The interest we take in where we are depends so much on prejudice; on whether we feel it’s acceptable or just plain possible to be interested. Receptivity or openness might be the chief characteristic of the traveller’s mindset. We approach new places with curiosity. We don’t assume we know anything. We stand on traffic islands and in narrow streets, gawping at and admiring what the locals take to be strange small details. We risk getting run over because we are intrigued by the roof of a government building or an inscription on a wall. We find a supermarket or hairdresser unusually fascinating. We dwell at length on the layout of a menu or the clothes of the presenters on the evening news. We are alive to the layers of a country’s history beneath the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At home on the other hand, we assume we’ve discovered most of what is interesting about the neighbourhood, simply by virtue of having lived there a long time. It seems so hard to imagine that there could be something novel to unearth in a place where we’ve spent our daily lives over many decades.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But imagine how much one might notice if one walked out of the front door, and imagined one had never seen any of it before, if one pictured oneself as a foreigner from a far off land newly disembarked off a long-haul flight. One might be fascinated by the milky green of the trees, and the endless procession of leaden clouds. One might note the ordered sterility of the supermarket, the diffident politeness of people on the bus, the native genius for skirting conflict with a particular kind of irony. In a glass-fronted office block on Washwood Heath Road, one might spot some people gesticulating in a boardroom on the first floor and wonder at the workings of the distinctive Capitalism that grows here.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The German philosopher Nietzsche expanded on the contrast: ‘When we observe how some people know how to manage their experiences – their insignificant, everyday experiences – so that they become an arable soil that bears fruit three times a year, while others – and how many there are! – are driven through surging waves of destiny, the most multifarious currents of the times and the nations, and yet always remain on top, bobbing like a cork, then we are in the end tempted to divide mankind into a minority (a minimality) of those who know how to make much of little, and a majority of those who know how to make little of much.’</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We meet people who have crossed deserts, floated on ice-caps and cut their way through jungles – and yet in whose hearts we would search in vain for evidence of what they have witnessed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given the limits on how much we are able to travel (and its costs and side-effects), we should endeavour to try, before taking off for distant hemispheres, to notice what we have already so often seen closer at hand. And when we despair at coming back, we should be goaded on by the thought that ‘boring home’ is always someone else’s deeply exciting ‘abroad’.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Next time you’re at Heathrow, worn down by the queues, corridors and bright lights, your spirits may briefly lift at the sight of a discreet island of beauty standing at the end of a pier in Terminal 3. It’s the airport’s control tower, designed by Richard Rogers Partnership, built for £50m, eighty-seven metres tall, the most advanced tower in Europe – and the replacement for a sombre and hideous 1955 tower near Terminal 1, which was decommissioned because it wasn’t tall enough to offer views over the new Terminal 5.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1834" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowA.jpg" alt="Control Tower Heathrow Airport, London, United Kingdom, 2007" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We aren’t very good at celebrating this sort of achievement. An ingrained artistic bias and technological pessimism continues to direct our admiration away from towers filled with banks of steadily breathing computers blinking their ruby red lights. It’s really only terrorists who get the measure of the wonders of our civilisation – however perversely they choose to respond to them by attempting to blow them up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet there is much to be admired in Heathrow’s tower, which looks like a giant eye or brain on a stick, tethered to its spot by massive steel cables bolted to blocks of concrete. Though one might have expected that the vital functions of an airport could by now all be relocated to a subterranean chamber, seeing the whole airfield from a single vantage point with your own eyes remains a surprisingly critical part of operations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1835" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowB.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If Heathrow had a monarch, he or she would set up a throne in this tower. Like the London Eye or Parliament Hill, the control tower is inherently pleasing because it grants us command over a landscape that at ground level is at risk of seeming unfathomably complex. From this height, even Heathrow starts to feel manageable, like a board game whose instructions one might pick up after a few rounds. The traumas and humiliations we experience passing through the airport emerge as mere sideshows in a far more noble central drama: the safe ascent and descent of vast aircraft along two implausibly long runways stained tar-black by rubber and oil. We’re reminded that there is more to flying than air miles and lounges, that it is still a sublime and heroic matter to pit oneself against gravity in an aluminium tube.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From here, we can contemplate the airport aesthetically, without the need to remember the armies of harried passengers wheeling their laptops along lino concourses, the covetous atmosphere of the duty free shops or the boredom and jet lag of the seating areas. Though it’s in the centre of one of the busiest airfields in the world, the tower is almost silent, insulated behind panes of 25mm glass, which reduce even the roar of a fully laden Air New Zealand 747-400, taking off to Auckland via Los Angeles, to a murmur. The quiet of the tower resembles nothing so much as the rooftop cocktail bar of an exclusive downtown skyscraper hotel, all leather and whispers, an atmosphere of plush serenity reinforced by the provision of a deep pile carpet and a wash of soft blue light emanating from recessed LEDs in the banisters and handrails.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It takes a professionally very contented person not to entertain at least a brief wish to give up on the ordinary mundane occupations of existence at ground-level in order to join the ranks of these privileged airport midwives, trained to fit their restless or exhausted charges carefully into their berths. Across the airfield, planes are on the move. Wide-bodied jets, from whose windows the whole world can seem like a miniature, now themselves look like an offering from Mattel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1836" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowC.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is an office like no other. There isn’t banter or horseplay here, for there are few jobs so serious that a second of distraction can lead to a thousand deaths. In the olden days, a plane might come in every quarter of an hour. Now it’s a matter of less than a minute between aircrafts. One imagines that the office Christmas party of these sky gazers will be a sober, precise affair (perhaps livened up by the odd paper napkin folded and sent flying over the table by the office wit). The engineers who designed the tower were paid to think the darkest thoughts – and then make sure their building could resist them. There is everything in double or more here – and short of a direct strike from a jet, the tower will endure long after the more delicate terminals which it serves have fallen into ruin. Six cables support the building against cross-winds when three would easily do; there are lifts as well as stairs up the central core and four independent power sources are available to run the equipment. The architecture is in the recognisable, colourful high tech style of the Richard Rogers partnership: the lift panels are yellow, there’s a band of red beneath the control capsule and the cabling and ducts are exposed on the lower floors. Whereas such traits might appear mannered and indulgent in buildings with less stringent technological requirements (city offices or private homes), here one feels that it is the purpose of the tower itself which has necessitated them – and so they have an aura of concentrated seriousness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1837" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030414-heathrowD.jpg" alt="PM-030414-heathrowD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The tower is wilfully undramatic about its achievements. Like so many bits of modern technology, it resists our curiosity. Few members of the public will ever be allowed to visit it. And yet it deserves to be recognised as one of the more awe-inspiring of contemporary achievements, in its own way a work of culture as complete as any artistic creation. So long as all goes well, most travellers through Heathrow will never have to think about the controllers. But when we pass through the airport, we should spare a moment to reflect that our journey was seemingly normal only because of some very abnormal processes and disciplines at work high in that elegant brain on a stick tethered to the ground in a ragged corner of Terminal 3.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Australia’s Western Desert covers some 600,000 square kilometres of the continent, stretching from the Nullarbor plain in the south to the Kimberley in the north, and from the Percival Lakes in the west through to the Pintupi lands in the Northern Territory. The terrain is vast, deeply opposed to life, filled with dangers – and a supreme aide to mental health.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert has never uttered a word, has never written anything down, has no mind or thought, and yet can be counted as one of the most philosophical entities on earth, always on hand, either practically or as a concept in our minds, to bring perspective back to our otherwise chaotic, harassed lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1857" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270314-desertA.jpg" alt="Sunset over Uluru, in the red desert of Australia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is usually unpleasant to be made to feel small by more successful peers and colleagues. But there are other far more satisfying ways to feel diminished. In the Great Sandy Desert regions, one sees gashes and fissures in the rocks that speak of disproportionate expanses of time. The earth’s tectonic plates have here rippled granite as though it were linen and spread it out in seeming infinity on a horizon, which eventually gives way to the featureless, baking plains of the Tanami desert. There is relief in contemplating rocks created four hundred million years ago; and the erosion of millennia marked on the walls of steep canyons. In the face of the strength, age and size of the universe, humans seem merely dust postponed.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Why the pleasure? Why might we seek out this feeling of smallness – and delight in it and recover balance through it? Because we naturally exaggerate our own importance. The incidents of our own lives loom very large in our view of the world. Yet, as the Australian Western Desert teaches us, we are minute and entirely dispensable in the greater scheme of things. The world will go on much the same without us, which can be a source of relief rather than distress. It is very helpful to be reduced, from time to time, in our own eyes, because this calms the urgent, disturbing (and very normal) sense that it matters so much what we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1858" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-270314-desertB.jpg" alt="The Olgas, Central Australia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need hints of the unimaginable extensions of space across the solar system, the galaxy, the cosmos. The sky at night from the desert is lit up with the sparkles of a million stars. Gazing up, none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes seem to have any relevance. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, will be of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. For a little while our own lives can seem blissfully unimportant. But it is not a personal affront. The same applies to everyone: it is levelling, humbling and a deep relief.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The desert rehearses in grand terms a lesson that ordinary life typically introduces viciously; that the universe is mightier than we are, that we are frail and temporary and have no alternative but to accept the limitations on our will; that we must bow to necessities greater than ourselves. This is the lesson written into the stones and the red sand. So grandly is it written there that we may come away from the desert, not crushed, but inspired by what lies beyond us; privileged to be subjects to such majestic necessities. We are the playthings of the forces that laid out those canyons and chiselled those barren mountains. The desert moves us to acknowledge limitations that we would otherwise encounter with anxiety or anger in the ordinary flow of events. It is not just nature that defies us. Human life is as overwhelming, but it is the vast spaces of nature that perhaps provide us with the finest, the most respectful reminder of all that exceeds us. If we spend time in them, they may help us to accept more graciously the great unfathomable events that molest our lives and will return us to dust.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There can be few websites more delightful than <a href="http://airlinemeals.net/" target="_blank">Airlinemeals.net</a>. It’s a site sure to be of interest to future anthropologists and that should already now be of interest to poets – because it is entirely dedicated to photographs of airline meals, which have been uploaded by passengers for no particular reason besides the sheer enjoyment of showing off and looking at food on trays in planes around the world.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1883" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsA.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">You can compare the cutlery on Swiss and Lufthansa, study what you’d get in ANA economy, admire the fluted glasses on TAP First Class and commiserate with anyone on Delta travelling across the Pacific between LAX and Sydney with only two pizzas and a roll for sustenance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1894" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsB-1.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Naturally airline food is dismal when we compare it to what we’d get on the ground but this is to miss the point of its charm. The thrill lies in the interaction between the meal and the dramatic, inhospitable place in which one is eating it. Food that, if eaten in a kitchen, would have been banal or offensive, acquires a new taste and interest in the presence of the clouds – like a picnic of bread and cheese that delights us when eaten on a clifftop above a pounding sea. With the in-flight tray, we make ourselves at home in an unhomely place: we appropriate the extraterrestrial skyscape with the help of a chilled bread roll and a plastic tray of potato salad.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1886" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsC.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To eat in odd outdoor places is to express a rare security and confidence. No longer do we have to huddle in a kitchen defensively, away from predators; now the whole world can be one’s dining room and a surge of confidence accompanies this recognition. One is laying one’s metaphorical picnic blanket over a vast terrain; the mountains of Arizona will be the setting for the starter, one will pick through an endive salad over the Utah desert and might move on to a chocolate sauce over the foothills of the Rockies. Out of the window is a sight that would have seemed earth-shattering to Michelangelo or Turner, though few people will ever bother to notice.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1896" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsD1.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In the airline industry, there has long been a discrepancy between how seriously carriers try to distract their passengers and how uninterested they are in trying to help them marvel at the technological and aesthetic phenomena around them.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Things are no less interesting on the ground, in the places where the meals are assembled. While the terminals are filled with TV screens showing CNN (rarely does the world seem a more boring, homogenous place than when seen through the eyes of this dismal channel), only a few metres away, in anonymous chilled warehouses, beautiful frenzied logistical efforts will be unfolding. Thousands of breakfasts, lunches and dinners, all intended for ingestion within the following few hours somewhere in the troposphere, are being prepared: Korean Airlines is serving beef broth, JAL salmon teriyaki and Air France a chicken escalope on a bed of pureed carrots. Foods that will later be segregated by airline now mingle freely together, much like passengers in the terminal, so that a tray containing a thousand plates of Dubai-bound Emirates hummus may be lined up in the freezer room next to four trolleys full of SAS gravadlax, set to fly part way to Stockholm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030314-airmealsE1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4544" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-030314-airmealsE1.jpg?resize=635%2C576" alt="PM-030314-airmealsE1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Airplane food fascinates because it stands at a point of maximum tension between the manmade and the natural, the technological and the organic. Even the most anaemic tomato (and so many on board are mesmerising in their fibrous pallor) remains a work of nature. How odd, then, that we should take our fruit, meat and vegetables up into the sky with us, when we used to sit more humbly at nature’s feet, hosting harvest festivals to honour the year’s wheat crop and sacrificing animals to ensure the continued fecundity of the earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The interest continues to the menus. There can be few literary works in any language as poetic as these documents:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The autumn blast</span></p>
<p class="p2">Blows along the stones</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On Mount Asama</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Lines composed by Matsuo Basho, the Japanese poet who brought the haiku form to its mature perfection in the Edo era. But how unevocative this is next to the verse of the poet at work somewhere within Air Canada’s catering operation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1890" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-030314-airmealsF.jpg" alt="PM-030314-airmealsF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">One of the eternal ambitions of art is to renew our love of things that get too easily taken for granted. <a href="http://airlinemeals.net/" target="_blank">Airlinemeals.net</a> is a major home of art in our time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pefkos1-1.jpg" alt="pefkos1-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You haven’t come to Rhodes to explore the medieval old town or the ancient temple of Apollo. You’ve not been drawn by a longing to try the local delicacy of chickpea fritters and unsalted ewe’s milk cheese. Your more sophisticated acquaintances would think it trivial. But you have come here for just one thing: to get some sun.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the beach, here, there are recliners under big straw sunshades on the beach. The water is warm. The heat envelops you and seems to ease the knotted muscles in your left shoulder. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every day, the sky is perfectly blue and unclouded. From your hotel balcony, you look out onto an arid, scrubby hill; you love the sight of the baked and cracked earth because it speaks of week after week of hot, dry weather. For months – practically for your whole life, it feels – you have been craving sunshine. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the north, the environment doesn’t feel benign. It can’t be trusted. You are always fending off something: the wind, the rain, the cold. Through the impossibly long winter and wintry spring you have been swaddling yourself in layers of garments. You hardly ever see your own legs – beyond a reluctant glance at their pasty paleness in the bath. You seriously wonder if anyone could find your body attractive these days. You eat for comfort. You’re always wanting scones or pies or big helpings of apple crumble. And it shows – somewhere under the habitual jumpers and coats. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But deep within you, you feel as if you are a creature essentially made for sunny mornings, hot, lazy afternoons and warm nights. That’s where you, homo sapiens, were designed to live. But by ingenious, effortful and it seems rather fateful manoeuvers, we humans have managed to sustain ourselves in fundamentally alien places that are reliably windswept, wet, icy and dreary for most of the year and only fitfully, capriciously anything else. We’ve made good lives for ourselves up there – in Wiesbaden, Trondheim, Hyvinkää and Calgary. But at a cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sunshine isn’t merely ‘nice’. It has a profound role in our lives. It is an agent of moral qualities: of generosity, courage, the appreciation of the present moment, confidence… When the world seems bountiful, material accumulation looks less impressive. When there is easy living, competition loses its edge. When it is so hot, there is no point trying to read – or even think too much. One is merely in the present.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These are corrective attitudes. Too much of them and they turn against themselves. If the ways of the north are too dominant and entrenched in your life you need the virtues of the south. You have come to lie on the beach at Pefkos not because you are light minded or indolent. But precisely because you have become – by habit – so dutiful, serious, hard working, disconnected from your body, over-cerebral and cautious. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is a deeply noble search for wisdom and balance (which are the ideal goals of art and civilisation) that has led you here – to the world of sun cream, dark glasses, recliners and vividly coloured cocktails by the pool.</span></p>
