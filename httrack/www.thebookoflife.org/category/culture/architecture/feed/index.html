				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">When it comes to design and decoration, it feels extremely tricky and dangerous to accuse anyone of having ‘bad taste’ or to pride oneself on having good taste. The official story is that anything goes – and no one knows what’s good or bad anyway.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But that seems too easy and lacking in ambition. Progress can in fact be made on this important issue – if we try to understand what psychological mechanisms govern the business of taste in the first place. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we have the taste we have? Why are we attracted or repelled by certain sorts of styles? The best way to interpret this is via a theory of <em>compensation</em>. We’re all a bit unbalanced inside and get attracted to styles in the world that promise to compensate us for the things we’re lacking within. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So for example, people who feel chaotic, undisciplined and cluttered inside, are liable to be very drawn to interiors that are serene, pure and poised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john_pawson_-_house_-_john_pawson_central_home_house_john_london.saa-hdr_1920x1080.8b6f936d82-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5789" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/john_pawson_-_house_-_john_pawson_central_home_house_john_london.saa-hdr_1920x1080.8b6f936d82-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="john_pawson_-_house_-_john_pawson_central_home_house_john_london.saa-hdr_1920x1080.8b6f936d82-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baron-House-Sweden-by-John-Pawson-004.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5790" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Baron-House-Sweden-by-John-Pawson-004.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="Baron-House-Sweden-by-John-Pawson-004" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Equally, people who are very exposed to, and oppressed by the hurried tempo of modern life – with its excessive brutality, precision and technological awe &#8211; are likely to be drawn to styles that speak of the rustic, the natural and the cosily shabby.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/saint-vivien-cottage-french-rentals-there-is-a-large-farmhouse-table-in-the-kitchen-333-1651362_2400_1800.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5791" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/saint-vivien-cottage-french-rentals-there-is-a-large-farmhouse-table-in-the-kitchen-333-1651362_2400_1800.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="saint-vivien-cottage-french-rentals-there-is-a-large-farmhouse-table-in-the-kitchen-333-1651362_2400_1800" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/petitetrianon4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5792" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/petitetrianon4.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="petitetrianon4" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that might be an explanation for taste; but what about ‘bad’ taste? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What singles out instances of ‘bad taste’ is excess in some direction or another: bad taste is a massive overcompensation, which has been generated by a sharp short-fall in some area or another. It’s a response to a psychological or physical trauma.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So for example, the Russians and the Saudis have over the years developed a reputation for spectacularly bad, as in gaudy and over-the-top, taste: a pumped version of Versailles in Riyadh or Moscow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ATT00139.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5794" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ATT00139.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="ATT00139" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t, in a sense, surprising: a century of extreme deprivation under Communism and an eternity of eking out a living in the barren deserts of Saudi Arabia have created understandably desperate desires for compensation – which have evidently rather overshot their mark. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or think of sentimental ‘bad’ taste: the kind where there are gnomes in the front gardens and gaudy and sickly sweet trinkets inside.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/497339343.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5796" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/497339343.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="497339343" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a style frequently favoured by the less well-off in society, people whose working lives are humiliating, backbreaking and the very opposite of welcoming or tender. It should be no wonder that these unfortunates might therefore be in the mood for something counterbalancingly sweet at home.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In every instance of bad taste, we’re looking at the over-eager embracing of a good quality – like sweetness, freedom, fun or prosperity – that was once in very short supply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/chip_01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5795" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/chip_01.jpg?resize=635%2C312" alt="chip_01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bad taste often sickens people but once one understands its origins, it starts to seem unduly harsh to judge like this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can all understand that if a person is starving, they might eagerly eat things which, in less desperate situations, they’d obviously reject – and that in their desperation, their manners might take a back seat. It’s not at all pretty – but we’d never blame them, because we know why they’re stuffing themselves with such haste.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should apply similar tact when confronted with unfortunate tastes in design. What’s ‘bad’ in bad taste isn’t the person, but the prior trauma which they are seeking to compensate for through their decor. There’s no point in mocking – or offering lectures about art history. The problem isn’t a lack of information. It is a trauma created by a badly broken and unbalanced world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PM-270214-chairA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5797" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PM-270214-chairA1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="Iraq End of Victory" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution to bad taste is therefore political. Good taste comes about when people feel appreciated, when there’s enough to go around and when there’s an economy which doesn’t routinely humiliate and abase its workers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To make good taste more widespread, what matters above all are efforts to diminish the desperate lives in which lapses of taste invariably have their origins.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People living in pleasant rural towns across the south of England, places like Chipping Norton and Ashford, are horrified by government aspirations to build thousands of new homes in the surrounding fields – to satisfy enormous public demand. The residents look out of their windows at oak trees, meadows and hedgerows, and vow to vote out of office anyone with any intentions of relaxing the tight planning regulations currently in force.</p>
<p>The consequences of their objections are highly significant. They are causing a grave housing crisis. Far fewer homes have been built than there is demand for, prices have risen relentlessly, mortgages are ruinous, huge numbers of people are sentenced to long commutes; and owning a decent house has become the task of a lifetime. It’s a social disaster.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to call the objectors selfish. But to solve the crisis they have created, it’s wiser, and more strategic, to try to get under the skin of people too easily dismissed as NIMBYs.</p>
<p>Most of the large housing developments built in the South East of England in the last 25 years share one common and (in this context) generally undiscussed feature: they are very ugly. Or, to be more precise, they are far uglier than the countryside they have replaced.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5043" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessA.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PM-290114-uglinessA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>In the mid-18th century, people looked on without dismay as the hills around the little town of Bath were given up to Queen Square, the Royal Crescent and Somerset Place.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5044" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessB.jpg?resize=635%2C255" alt="PM-290114-uglinessB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>Few minded the lost fields</h5>
<p>Likewise, a little further back, when the wetlands, scrubby reed beds and sandy islands at the mouth of the River Po were sacrificed to urban expansion, few people were likely to have raised protests – given what would come to replace them.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessC.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5045" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessC.gif?resize=635%2C293" alt="PM-290114-uglinessC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5046" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessD.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>History shows us that people don’t object to new housing per se, they object when the houses are less beautiful than the natural landscape they have devoured. This starts to isolate the cause of Britain’s housing crisis – as well as to point the way to a solution to it. It is, literally, ugliness that is to blame for the current social catastrophe. What seems like negative and entrenched NIMBYism is at heart an inarticulate, disguised but understandable plea for grace, elegance and a touch of grandeur.</p>
<p>The answer isn’t to build replicas of Georgian crescents, let alone rows of canal-side Gothic palaces (any more than it would be an idea for someone who loved the English language to begin addressing strangers in Shakespearean dialect). The answer is to create housing developments in the best architectural idiom of our times, places like – for example – the exceptional Accordia housing scheme in the suburbs of Cambridge (to which, unsurprisingly, no one objected).</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessE.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5047" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-290114-uglinessE.jpg?resize=635%2C372" alt="PM-290114-uglinessE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Solving the housing crisis requires that we get better at grasping the nature of the problem we’re facing: the issue isn’t stubborn selfishness. It’s a longing for beauty. Crack that, and no one will mind the felled trees too much, and mortgages will come down too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Even very secular people tend to admit that when it comes to architecture, religions have done some very beautiful things. You can be left utterly cold by all the superstitious aspect of religions, and yet still be in awe at the profundity, intricacy and sheer prettiness of many mosques, temples, cathedrals and churches.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/70/156730595_a1f88eb2f0_b.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="516" /></p>
<p class="p1">However, any nostalgia for these lovely buildings is always cut short by the thought that an end to faith must inevitably mean an end to the possibility of putting up anything like them today.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet on examination, it in no way logically follows that an end to our belief in sacred beings must mean an end to an attachment to certain sorts of atmosphere and architecture. In the absence of gods, we still retain a longing for calm, for community, for grandeur, for sweetness, for perspective – all of which can be found and celebrated through architecture.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We still need secular buildings that, like the temples and cathedrals of old, create feelings of awe, gratitude, wonder, mystery and silence; buildings that bring us together for special moments of the year (the passing of seasons) or to mark key moments of our lives (births, marriages, deaths). We need abstracted awe-inspiring sonorous spaces that take us out of the everyday and encourage contemplation, perspective, love and (at times) a pleasing terror.</span></p>
<p class="p1">There have over the last 200 years been a few examples of buildings that have learnt from religion without themselves being religious &#8211; buildings that can inspire new generations of patrons and architects.</p>
<p class="p1">The tradition of the non-religious &#8216;temple&#8217; or &#8216;chapel&#8217; begins with the French sociologist August Comte in the 19th century, who invented a secular religion, as he called it &#8216;A religion for humanity&#8217; and designed some temples to go with it. He proposed that specially-built large halls would be decorated with portraits of the pantheon of his new religion&#8217;s secular saints, including Cicero, Pericles, Shakespeare and Goethe, all singled out by the founder for their capacity to inspire and reassure us.</p>
<p class="p1">A few of these Comte-inspired temples have been built. There is one in the Marais in Paris.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/2.bp.blogspot.com/-AsV3Z1lU5_0/VQdhwxVo5OI/AAAAAAAAaG8/S3_ZLmvFagA/s1600/05.jpg?resize=741%2C350" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">And three more in Brazil, including this one in Porto Alegre:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Templo_positivista.jpg?resize=694%2C520" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">In the 20th century, the most notable secular chapel is perhaps Mark Rothko&#8217;s building in Houston, Texas, a place full of melancholy serenity:</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/dome.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.3/32628/117745_sv.jpg?resize=634%2C421" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Though nominally a Catholic building, the firm atheist Henri Matisse&#8217;s chapel in Vence in the South of France deserves to be counted among the great secular temples.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/lieux-de-retraite.croire.com/lieu_images/76/Dominicaines_Maison_Lacordaire_06140.jpg?resize=703%2C463" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Equally impressive is Peter Zumthor&#8217;s field chapel near Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.e-architect.co.uk/images/jpgs/germany/bruder_klaus_kapelle_germany_jl060408_02.jpg?resize=679%2C509" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">The most recent, and in many ways the most profound and thought-through addition to the genre has been a building by the artist Grayson Perry, dedicated to thwarted female creativity and potential &#8211; and ostensibly focused on the cult of a fictional (but so was Mary&#8230;) deity called Julie Cope.</p>
<p class="p1">The building has been designed to evoke a tradition of wayside and pilgrimage chapels in the landscape. It is a singular building, appearing as a small, beautifully crafted object amongst the trees and fields.</p>

<p class="p1">On a sunny weekend, the building &#8211; in north Essex, England &#8211; attracts hundreds of &#8216;pilgrims':</p>

<p class="p1">These exceptional buildings are in fact only the beginning of a movement that could grow ever larger as the secular world becomes more conscious of its needs.</p>
<p class="p1">One could also, for example, imagine a building that would take up the traditional role of religious architecture in returning to us a sense of perspective.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>- A Building for Perspective</b></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Considering how much of our lives we spend exaggerating our own importance, it would be highly useful to come across an architecture than answers our need for perspective. </span>Architecture can perform a critical function by adjusting our impressions of our physical – and as a consequence also our psychological – size, by playing with dimensions, materials, sounds and sources of illumination. In certain buildings that are vast in scale or hewn out of massive, antique-looking stones; or in others that are dark save for a single shaft of light filtering in from a distant oculus; or silent but for the occasional sound of water dripping from a great height into a deep pool, we may feel that we are being introduced, with unusual and beguiling grace, to a not unpleasant sense of our own insignificance.</p>
<p class="p1">Imagine a &#8216;temple&#8217; for perspective whose structure would represent the age of the earth, with each centimetre of height equating to one million years. Measuring 46 metres in all, the tower would feature, at its very base, a tiny band of gold only one millimetre thick, standing for mankind’s time on earth.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1349" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/dystopia1.jpg" alt="dystopia1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/static.neatorama.com/images/2013-02/temple-to-perspective1.jpg?resize=600%2C422" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/static.dezeen.com/uploads/2012/01/dezeen_Temple-to-Perspective-by-Thomas-Greenhall-and-Jordan-Hodgson-3.jpg" alt="Temple to Perspective by Tom Greenall and Jordan Hodgson for Alain de Botton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p class="p1"><b>- A Retreat for Thinking</b></p>
<p class="p1">Or imagine a retreat for focusing our thoughts. It is one of the unexpected disasters of the modern age that our new unparalleled access to information has come at the price of our capacity to concentrate on anything much. The deep, immersive thinking which produced many of civilisation’s most important achievements is now under unprecedented assault. We are almost never far from some machine that will guarantee us a mesmerising and libidinous escape from reality. The feelings and thoughts which we have omitted to feel and think while looking at our screens are left to find their revenge in involuntary twitches and our ever-increasing inability to fall asleep when we should. So we can picture a building for thought would lend structure and legitimacy to moments of solitude. It would be a simple space, offering visitors little beyond a bench or two, a vista and a suggestion that they set to work on unravelling some of the troubling themes that they have been using their normal activity to suppress.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1352" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/path.jpg" alt="path" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h6 class="p1"></h6>
<p class="p1">This is only a start: we also need new venues in which to get married, get to know other members of the community, mark deaths and ritualise and lend gravity to key moments of life.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Secular societies should revive and continue the underlying aims of religious architecture: to place us for a time in a thoughtfully-structured, three-dimensional space in order to educate and rebalance our inner selves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most people nowadays believe that you can’t really say in any definitive way what is beautiful or ugly in urban planning. The idea that taste is relative has deep roots in modern culture. To dispute it is to risk being seen as slightly unhinged or even dictatorial.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2045" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designA.jpg" alt="Australia - Dec 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">You can’t say what’s beautiful and what’s not</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s totally understandable how this attitude came to have such prestige. It started out as a campaign for kindness. It seemed very mean to say that what someone loved the look or sound of wasn’t acceptable or legitimate. In some circles, forty years ago, if you’d said that you preferred the Beatles to Beethoven, there would have been disapproving stares and a few contemptuous mutterings. You’d have been made to feel that you were a bad person for having the ‘wrong taste’. It’s very good that this sort of condemnation has fallen completely out of fashion. Obviously people like different kinds of music and that’s fine.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2046" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designB.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not everyone loves Siena – though most people do</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There really do seem to be some entirely sensible differences of opinion around taste. You just can’t say absolutely that Paris is more beautiful than Siena. They’re both wonderful in different ways. They each meet a different need of the soul. One is expansive, ordered, grand; the other is intimate, with lots of crooked little twists and turns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2048" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS - 2004" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because it really isn’t possible to say which is best, decent people rightly opt for the view that this sort of thing is always going to be a personal question. It’s up to you which one you like more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But this kindly, very sensible move, has an unexpected consequence. People who have no interest whatsoever in making any city even remotely beautiful or dignified can get away with some truly terrible construction projects free of any fear of being criticised.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280314-designD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4509" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-280314-designD.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="PM-280314-designD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Few people look at the waterfront of Brisbane, the capital of the Australian state of Queensland, and feels deeply moved by the grace and sweetness of the scene. While most people find the centre of Paris wonderful and others will delight in the winding streets of Siena, no one on the planet responds deeply to the brutal cross city expressway and chunky stained brown office blocks of the city.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are many planning restrictions in Brisbane – but they concern health and safety issues: the distance between street lamps, where electrical cables must be located or how tall a building can be. No one worries that that is slightly dictatorial. But the regulations say absolutely nothing about the most important thing: whether a building has to be beautiful or noble or grand or elegant. That is regarded as entirely beyond the range of governmental duty.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So even though almost everyone on the planet thinks that either Siena or Paris is delightful and everyone thinks that Brisbane is a bit of a mess, we don’t dare to speak; we are left cowering. We feel paralysed – unable to state the obvious. And that’s because we have talked ourselves into the belief that taste is always relative.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2050" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designE.jpg" alt="Various - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">It didn’t occur to them that taste was relative: everything had to be a certain way</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet when we consider the effects of this polite belief, it’s slightly sickening. Societies that didn’t for a moment think that taste was relative managed to produce exactly the kinds of places that many people today find delightful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2052" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designF.jpg" alt="Various, Britain - Sep 2012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">By imposing a single standard of beauty wonderful cities were built</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We pay a huge price for our polite relativism. We’ve surrendered the biggest collective endeavour of humanity – creating cities – to people who couldn’t care less what they look like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2053" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-280314-designG.jpg" alt="PM-280314-designG" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By tracing the problem back to its root cause, one does manage to find a solution to the mess. There’s no need for any city government to find a single ideal, a perfect model for a city. Siena, Paris, Bath and Edinburgh all look very different. But in each case the planners in the past hit upon a pretty good basic model and imposed it widely. It wasn’t the same model. But they were all good enough. But in Brisbane – and a lot of other modern cities – there was a fatal refusal to select any model at all. So the result is chaotic ugliness – which no one likes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It seems strange to say that a large issue of modern society is essentially philosophical. We’re more used to thinking that the causes of our troubles are economic. But we are not too poor to build wonderful cities. We are something far, far worse and rather more shameful: we are too muddled in our minds.</span></p>
