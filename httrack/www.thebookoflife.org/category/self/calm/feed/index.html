				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Even though our minds ostensibly belong to us, we don’t always control or know what is in them. There are always some ideas, bang in the middle of consciousness, that are thoroughly and immediately clear to us: for example, that we love our children. Or that we have to be out of the house by 7.40am. Or, that we are keen to have something salty to eat right now. These thoughts feel obvious without burdening us with uncertainty or any requirement that we reflect harder on them.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a host of other ideas tend to hover in a far more unfocused state. For example, we may know that our career needs to change, but it’s hard to say much more. Or we feel some resentment against our partner over an upsetting incident the night before, but we can’t pin down with any accuracy what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. Our confusions sometimes have a positive character about them but are perplexing all the same: perhaps there was something deeply ‘exciting’ about a canal-side cafe we discovered in Amsterdam or the sight of a person reading on a train or the way the sun lit up the sky in the evening after the storm, but it may be equally hard to put a finger on the meaning of these feelings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2422" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/129344029.jpg" alt="Pastor Johnnie Moore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfocused thoughts are constantly orbiting our minds, but from where we are, from the observatory of our conscious selves (as it were), we can’t grasp them distinctly. We speak of needing to ‘sort our heads out’ or to ‘get on top of things’, but quite how one does something like this isn’t obvious – or very much discussed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is one response to dealing with our minds that has become immensely popular in the West in recent years. Drawn from the traditions of Buddhism, the practice of meditation has gripped the Western imagination, presenting itself as a solution to the problems of our chaotic minds. It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults in the US has taken part in some form of structured meditation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2423" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/170033293.jpg" alt="Yoga at Nepal's Boudnath Stupa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adherents of meditation suggest that we sit very quietly, in a particular bodily position, and strive, through a variety of exercises, to<em> empty</em> our minds of content, quite literally to push or draw away the disturbing and unfocused objects of consciousness to the periphery of our minds, leaving a central space empty and serene. In the Buddhist world-view, anxieties and excitements are not trying to tell us anything especially interesting or valuable. We continuously fret without good purpose, about this or that random and vain thing – and therefore the best solution is simply to push the objects of the mind to one side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2424" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Meditation3c.jpg" alt="Obit Philip Seymour Hoffman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Eastern Meditation: the mind being emptied of its confused content</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buddhist meditation has been so successful, we are liable to forget another effective and in some ways superior path to finding peace of mind, this one rooted in the Western tradition: Philosophical Meditation. Like its Eastern counterpart, Philosophical Meditation wants our thoughts, feelings and anxieties to trouble us less, but it seeks to sort out our minds in a very different manner. At heart, it doesn’t believe that the contents of our minds are nonsensical or meaningless. Our worries may seem like a nuisance but they are in fact neurotically garbled but important signals about how we should direct our lives. They contain complex clues as to our development. Therefore, rather than wanting simply to <em>empty</em> our minds of content, practitioners of Philosophical Meditation encourage us to<em> clean</em> these minds up: they want to bring the content that troubles us more securely into focus, and thereby usher in calm through understanding rather than through evacuation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2425" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Self-analysis31.jpg" alt="Obit Philip Seymour Hoffman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Western Meditation: the mind’s confused objects being brought into focus</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How does one bring the confused objects of the mind into focus? There are instructions for Philosophical Meditation, just as there are for Buddhist Meditation (a little artificiality in these matters may just be what we need to lend the process discipline). The first priority is to set aside a bit of time, ideally 20 minutes, once a day. One should sit with a pad of paper and start by asking oneself a very simple set of questions: what is it that I am <em>regretful, anxious</em> or <em>excited</em> about at present? One is invited to download the immediate contents of one’s mind. One will by nature be a little unsure of what our feelings mean, so it is best simply to write down – without thinking or censoring ourselves – one or two words around each feeling. It’s a case of tipping out the contents of the mind onto the paper as unselfconsciously as possible. One might, for example, write down: Darren, Cologne trip, weekend, shoes, Mum, face at train station… The task is then to try to convert each of these words from an ambiguous and silent worry, regret or thrill into something one can understand, grasp, order and eventually better control. Success in this meditation relies on a skilful process of questioning. Imagine these thoughts as ineloquent and muddled strangers, who are full of valuable ideas, but whom one has to get to know in a roundabout way, by directing just the right questions at them. [See the link at the end of this piece for a more complete Guide to Philosophical Meditation]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophical Meditation brings us calm not by removing issues, so much as by helping us to understand them, thereby evaporating some of the paranoia and static that might otherwise cling to them. When confused objects of consciousness become clearer, they stop bothering us quite so much. Problems don’t disappear, but they assume proportion and can be managed. For example, we may make ourselves at home with an array of administrative worries that had been clumsily concealed under the vague title of ‘the Cologne trip’. The word ‘Darren’ might disclose someone we envy, but who holds out a fascinating run of clues as to how we might make a new move in our career. The word ‘weekend’ yields feelings towards one’s partner which are both resentful and yet capable of being discussed and perhaps worked through in the evening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sorting out our minds doesn’t just feel comforting (like tidying our homes), it also spares us grave errors. Confused excitement can be highly dangerous when it involves career ambitions. Imagine someone with a tendency to experience excitement when reading <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Gourmet Traveller</em> – and who then declares, without much attempt to analyse the feeling, that they want ‘to work in magazines’. It may seem reasonable enough for them to send off a CV to the magazine company HQ. After many efforts, they may be offered a lowly internship. It might take a few years and a lot of heartache before they realise that it wasn’t really the magazines themselves that were the true object of their attraction to begin with. Actually what was really speaking to this person was the idea of working in a close-knit team in an area that wasn’t finance (where Mum, a caustic and forbidding figure, puritanical in matters of sex and money, spent her career). Philosophical Meditation can, among other things, save us a lot of time.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2426" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/83542110.jpg" alt="Grazia Magazine Produces Issue From New Shopping Centre" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not thinking might land you up here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar dangers play out when one is upset or anxious. Imagine that yesterday, you had dinner at the house of a conspicuously successful friend. They’d just got back from a holiday in the Maldives and were telling you about their latest business venture in pharmaceuticals. You left feeling restless and annoyed, but you didn’t know why. Your own life felt flat and dispiriting. Vague plans about what to do swirled around in your head. Maybe you could have a brilliant idea and start a business. Somehow you wanted your life to be more like your friend’s. But what is a brilliant idea in business? How does one get going? Then your partner said something about having set up a dinner with her mother. At that moment, from somewhere mysterious in you, you felt a wave of anger – and shouted something about the house always being left in such a mess. After all, there was a set of dirty plates in your field of vision. But your partner said you were crazy, the house wasn’t that messy anyway, and how long would it take to tidy away a few plates in the first place…? She walked out of the room crossly and so tonight, you’ll be sleeping on the sofa again for a whole set of reasons that it’s now becoming very hard to disentangle, let alone discuss with any degree of maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our confused inner experiences. We pick the wrong job; get together with the wrong person, run away from the right person; spend our money on the wrong things and don’t do justice to our talents and deeper aspirations. Acting without Philosophical Meditation is like being allowed to embark on a trip without checking the equipment or the map. We trust the feelings without duly acknowledging that they may prompt us in some catastrophic directions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2427" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/174570022.jpg" alt="Ordination of 13,000 novices at Wat Phra Dhammakaya - a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The longing to<em> empty</em> the mind, to calm turbulent thoughts isn’t completely opposed to the exercise of <em>cleaning up</em> the mind, decoding, analysing and ordering its contents. It’s just that at the moment, as societies, we have allowed ourselves to get overly seduced by the promise of tranquility, so that we always strive to empty the mind, instead of attempting to understand its contents. We see our agitation as the result of thinking too much, rather than of not having – as yet – thought enough. It’s time for our societies to take on board the promises and advantages of Philosophical Meditation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong>An Introduction to Philosophical Meditation</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2432" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/990px-Sanzio_01.jpg?resize=406%2C315" alt="990px-Sanzio_01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Once a day, clear a 20 minute stretch of time. Sit comfortably with pen and paper. Ask yourself three initial questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i. what am I currently upset about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ii. what am I currently anxious about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">iii. what am I currently curious or excited about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re likely to be able to jot down a few things under each of these categories, but keep the answer deliberately unprocessed, just a word or so, as vague as it is likely to be in its raw form. Your list will be incomprehensible to anyone else. It might read: ‘biscuits, Chinese woman, 10.30, TBOL, food’ or ‘Mother, invoice, Seoul, Luke, trees in wind’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. You’re likely to have between two to three words under each of the three categories: Upset, Anxiety, Excitement (the mind can’t properly hold too much at any one time, even in its darker reaches).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Drill systematically into each category (Upset, Anxiety, Excitement) using the questions below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct the following questions/directions at each of your ‘words’ in turn:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no need to answer all the questions. They won’t all be relevant. They are prompts and might prompt other questions in you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR UPSET:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By ‘upset’, one means: minor and major hurts from people or situations. An unkind word, a slight, a feeling of envy, a sense of abandonment… The theory is that we often don’t allow ourselves to analyse our hurts from a misplaced sense of stoicism and bravery. We pay for this dearly, for undigested hurts generate bitterness, confusion and misdirected aggression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Retell yourself the upsetting incident in great detail as if you were telling it to an extremely kind and patient friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What scared you about the incident?</span></p>
<p class="p1">- You’ve been hurt. It’s normal to be hurt. How have you been hurt?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What good part of yourself feels in danger?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How might a nice person have ended up doing what this person did to you? If they weren’t actively mean, what other explanations could there be for the hurt they have caused?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this were to carry on, what might be the catastrophe?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What are you afraid might happen if this were to continue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Have you been affected like this before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If you had to pin down an incident in the past that this somehow reminds you of, what would it be? Is there a pattern here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this had happened to a friend, how would you advise them?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What might you be able to learn from this upset?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR ANXIETY:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is a garbled signal about what a part of us perceives as a danger. It both asks for worry while not clearly revealing the roots of its concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Tell the story of the coming anxious period in great detail and say exactly what you imagine might go wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What would happen to you if it all went wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing were to keeping getting worse, then ….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- The danger here is that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How might you still be OK, even if it was all absolutely terrible?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How would the person you’d like to be ideally deal with this situation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What previous situation does this remind you of? Have you been in something like this before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What happened in the past?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What helped in the past</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR EXCITEMENT:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By excitement is meant a range of positive emotions, tremors of interest, pleasing nostalgia, tentative enthusiasm, visual delight and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Describe your excitement as if to a sympathetic, interested friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- You need to change your life in certain ways: what would it be to change your life in the light of this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What are the good things contained here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Humans have an impulse towards growth: what call to growth is here in a garbled form?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- This exciting thing holds a clue to what is missing in my life; what might be missing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- When else have you felt something similar?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing could talk, what might it tell me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing could try to change my life, what changes might it advise?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If other parts of my life were more like this, what might they be like?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Answering these questions can’t necessarily remove troubles but they start the work of decoding the scrambled messages. They reduce anxiety (rather than guarantee utter tranquility); they increase clarity – rather than promise instant enlightenment.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nowadays, almost all of us wish we could be calmer. It’s one of the distinctive longings of the modern age. Across history, people have tended to seek out adventure and excitement. But most of us have had a bit too much of that now. The desire to be more tranquil and focused is the new, ever more urgent priority.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4063" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1.jpg?resize=499%2C358" alt="14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our view, there are eight basic causes of agitation – and the path to greater calm involves attempting to consider each one systematically and returning to it on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">One: Panic about Panic</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of agitation is caused by an unrealistic sense of how unusual difficulty is. We are oppressed by unhelpful images of how easy it is to achieve and how normal it is to succeed. The stories that officially circulate about what relationships and careers are like tend fatally to downplay the darker realities, leaving many of us not only upset, but upset that we are upset, feeling persecuted as well as miserable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2933" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109088579.jpg?resize=396%2C264" alt="Skiing Couples Wed Atop Colorado's Loveland Ski Area" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">If your life is rather more difficult than this saccharine image, it must be that you are a freak or a failure</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to change our points of reference about what life is like. We need – in the broadest sense – better art, a kind that takes us more truthfully into the realities of relationships, the workplace and our 3am panics. We need to make sure we are surrounded by accurate case studies of the ordinary miseries of daily life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2934" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmC.jpg" alt="PM-170314-calmC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The Agony in the Kitchen, Jessica Todd Harper, 2012</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consider this helpfully realistic picture of the life of a couple. Many things are going well for them. Earlier one of their children showed them such a sweet drawing she’d done at school. They had a nice holiday last year. They love playing soccer together in the park (the mum gets really competitive and has discovered she’s a brilliant goalkeeper). They are trying to work out whether to move to a village outside the city. Sometimes they feel so close. But this evening is a nightmare. She received a flirtatious email from an ex-boyfriend of years ago; she hasn’t shown it to her husband, but it’s on her mind as a source of torment. It’s opened up imaginative possibilities. She has put her head in her hands – but he’s said twenty times that drives him nuts. His mother used to do that. Their marriage is OK. They’ve been together nine years. They’re going to survive long-term, but right now, they’re about to have a titanic fight. He’ll call her a bitch and slam the door, but he’s quite nice – genuinely…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should contemplate this image to reduce panic about our relationships. Difficulty is normal. Very decent couples have long-running and extraordinarily vicious conflicts over apparently small things. In a good relationship, two nights out of five you will wonder what you are doing together. That is success. It’s worth repeating: two bad nights a week is lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The French 18th-century philosopher Chamfort wisely observed: ‘A person should swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more revolting in the day ahead.’ Disgusting things are on the menu for all of us. Life, it seems, is – in many ways – about quite a lot of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4069" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmD1.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="A 4158" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Look at this image by the Spanish painter Velázquez. Christianity is upfront about the idea that our lives will be burdened by suffering. You don’t have to believe in the religion (we don’t) to recognise there’s something important at play here. Christianity takes the view that loss, self-reproach, failure, regret, sickness and sadness will always find ways of entering life. Our troubles need practical help, of course. But Christianity identifies another need as well: for our suffering to be recognised as normal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This picture of the Crucifixion universalises suffering. The painter shows a good – indeed perfect – man being humiliated, injured and ultimately killed. He invites us to contemplate the centrality of suffering in the achievement of all valuable goals. Rather than concentrate on the moment of fulfilment – when one feels the joy of success – he directs our attention to the times of hardship and sacrifice and says they are the most important, the most deserving of admiration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such dark images strengthen us a little – and offer valuable consolation – for the hard tasks of our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Taking too much responsibility</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We over-personalise our fates, taking too much credit in the good times, and then, too much blame in the bad ones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to take all the credit when there is a triumph. But the corollary is that we are entirely to blame when we are humiliated and beaten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2939" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmE.jpg?resize=487%2C352" alt="The New York Stock Exchange during the global banking crisis, America - 10 Oct 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are particularly prone to over-personalisation when it comes to money. To keep our agitation in check we should embrace an economic perspective that allows us to see ourselves as operating within a huge system loosely designated as ‘Capitalism’. Regular contemplation of an image of the New York Stock Exchange reminds us that the way the world works is not our own doing. Powerful forces sweep over whole industries, condemning some to decline, while raising others to remarkable (if unstable) prosperity. The key point is: much about your fate is not your own work. You did not invent the world. You are not personally entirely responsible for your condition. The suffering is real, but remember that it is less personal than we tend to suppose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmF.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4067" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmF.jpg?resize=417%2C373" alt="PM-170314-calmF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a statue of the Roman goddess of Fortune. The Romans knew her as ‘Fortuna’. She was to be found on the back of most Roman coins, holding a cornucopia in one hand and a rudder in the other. She was beautiful and usually wore a light tunic and smiled attractively. The cornucopia was a symbol of her power to bestow favours, but the rudder was a symbol of her more sinister power to change destinies, just like that. She could scatter gifts (a love affair, a great job, beautiful children), then with terrifying speed shift the rudder’s course, maintaining a chilling smile as she watched us choke to death on a fishbone, disappear in a landslide or go bankrupt in a credit crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goddess of Fortune remains a useful image to keep our exposure to accident, luck and fate continually in our minds; she conflates a range of threats to our security into one ghastly anthropomorphic enemy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not everything that happens to us occurs with reference to something about us. Our romantic or professional failure does not have to be read as retribution for some sin we have committed, it is not always rational punishment handed out after careful examination of all the evidence by an all-seeing Providence in a divine courtroom; it may be a cruel, but morally meaningless, byproduct of the machinations of a rancorous goddess. The interventions of Fortune, of ‘luck’, whether they are kindly or diabolical, introduce a random element into human destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be calm, we must reduce the weight of our proud and unrealistic modern individualism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Being too Hopeful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A major source of agitation is, strange as it might at first sound, optimism. The expectation that things will go well creates anxiety because, at some level, we know that we can’t quite count on our hopes coming to fruition. And of course, as things turn out, quite often they don’t. We are on tenterhooks – and we suffer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To restore calm we need to become strategically pessimistic. That is, to spend more time getting used to the very real possibility that things will work out rather badly. A lot of good projects fail, most things go wrong, at least half our dreams won’t work out. Pessimism dampens unhelpful and impatient expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is hope – with regard to our careers, our love lives, our children, our politicians and our planet – that is primarily to blame for angering and embittering us. The incompatibility between the scale of our aspirations and the reality of life generates the anxious disappointments which spoil so many days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are some extremely helpful pessimists in the history of philosophy, waiting to cheer us up. The French philosopher Blaise Pascal stands out for the exceptionally therapeutic nature of his gloom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmG.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4071" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmG.jpg?resize=635%2C473" alt="PM-170314-calmG" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In his book, the <em>Pensées</em>, Pascal misses no opportunities to confront his readers with evidence of how badly things normally turn out. In seductive classical French, he informs us that happiness is an illusion (‘Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself’), that misery is the norm (‘If our condition were truly happy we should not need to divert ourselves from thinking about it’) and that we have to face the desperate facts of our situation head on: ‘Man’s greatness comes from knowing he is wretched’.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the tone, it comes as something of a surprise to discover that reading Pascal is not at all the depressing experience one might have presumed. The work is consoling, heartwarming and even, at times, hilarious. For those teetering on the verge of despair, there can paradoxically be no finer book to turn to than one which seeks to grind man’s every last hope into the dust. The Pensées, far more than any sentimental volume touting inner beauty, positive thinking or the realisation of hidden potential, has the power to coax the suicidal off the ledge of a high parapet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is relief, which can explode into bursts of laughter, when we finally come across evidence that our very worst insights, far from being unique and shameful, are part of the common, inevitable reality of mankind. Our dread that we might be the only ones to feel anxious, bored, jealous, cruel, perverse and narcissistic turns out to be gloriously unfounded, opening up unexpected opportunities for communion around our dark realities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should honour Pascal, and the long line of pessimistic philosophers to which he belongs, for doing us the incalculably great favour of publicly and elegantly rehearsing the facts of life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is not a stance with which the modern world betrays much sympathy, for one of its dominant characteristics, and certainly its greatest flaw, is its optimism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite occasional moments of panic, most often connected to market crises, wars or pandemics, the secular age maintains an all but irrational devotion to a narrative of improvement, based on a messianic faith in the three great drivers of change: science, technology and business. Material improvements since the mid-18th century have been so remarkable, and have so exponentially increased our comfort, safety, wealth and power, as to deal an almost fatal blow to our capacity to remain pessimistic – and therefore, crucially, to our ability to stay calm. It has been impossible to hold on to a balanced assessment of what life is likely to provide for us when we have witnessed the cracking of the genetic code, the invention of the mobile phone, the opening of Western-style supermarkets in remote corners of China and the launch of the Hubble telescope.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2943" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmH.jpg?resize=497%2C328" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - 24 Oct 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet while it is undeniable that the scientific and economic trajectories of mankind have been pointed firmly in an upward direction for several centuries, we do not comprise mankind: none of us individuals can dwell exclusively amidst the ground-breaking developments in genetics or telecommunications that lend our age its distinctive and buoyant prejudices. We may derive some benefit from the availability of hot baths and computer chips, but our lives are no less subject to accident, frustrated ambition, heartbreak, jealousy, anxiety or death than were those of our medieval forebears. But at least our ancestors had the advantage of living in pessimistic times which never made the mistake of promising its population that happiness could ever make a permanent home for itself on this earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2944" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmI.jpg" alt="PM-170314-calmI" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s worth adding that a pessimistic worldview does not have to entail a life stripped of joy. Pessimists can have a far greater capacity for appreciation than optimists, for they never expect things to turn out well and so may be amazed by the modest successes which occasionally break across their darkened horizons. It’s quite possible to be both pessimistic and, day to day, a real laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: We don’t know what we are bothered about</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">We don’t like admitting it but quite often we don’t really know what it is that has caused us to get so agitated. It can feel like an insult: we are upset and we don’t know why. But really it is a helpful thought. Finding out the real cause is the key to bringing relief: unanalysed frustration is the root cause of rage; we need to work on repatriating our emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s imagine an explosion of annoyance of the dishwasher being left in a mess by one&#8217;s partner. One starts to shout at them, complaining all the time of &#8216;the chaos.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2954" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmA.jpg?resize=482%2C361" alt="How not to load a dishwasher." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<p class="p1">But though one&#8217;s anger has locked on to the state of the dishwasher, perhaps the root cause lies elsewhere, for example, in a tense situation at work, or in an unresolved discussion about sex from the night before.</p>
<p class="p1">The way to calm is through analysis. We need to spend time on self-knowledge. We have to try to isolate the genuine cause, which might lie quite far from the surface eruption. The pursuit of calm isn’t about making every single moment perfectly tranquil. It&#8217;s to prevent agitation turning into catastrophe &#8211; which involves a constant effort to take apart moods of anxiety in order to pinpoint their real causes.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Capitalism and False Glamour</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is inbuilt in capitalism that the best things in life cannot be the free ones. On the contrary, capitalism is keen to tell us things which are inexpensive cannot be much good and that everything worth having costs a lot of money – more than you have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a profound cause of lack of calm in our lives. It means that we are continually agitated by the worry that we can’t afford the things that will make us happy. It’s a very understandable anxiety. But it is unhelpful – and based on a falsehood. We need to remind ourselves – on a regular basis – that inexpensive, simple things may often have much more to offer us. Ideally, a large part of modern culture would support us in that calming endeavour. But, for the moment, it is something we have to do for ourselves, with the assistance of some impressive allies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2958" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmC.jpg" alt="PM-180314-calmC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This beautiful bowl is telling us a helpful thing: that things that are precious in their meaning and visual appeal needn’t be financially precious – and this is very good news in a world where hardly anyone has lots of money. It is one strand of how we can deal better with consumerism, disrupting the linear relationship between expense and goodness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this particular bowl is in an art gallery – and would cost a fortune to buy – it’s not much different (and certainly no better) than one we might pick up cheaply in Ikea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2959" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmD.jpg?resize=498%2C553" alt="PM-180314-calmD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the heroes of appreciating the real worth of simple, inexpensive things is the 18th-century French painter Jean-Siméon Chardin</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everything here is simple and modest. And wonderful. Someone preserved the apricots last autumn. It didn’t cost much to do that – at least not in financial terms; what it took was care and patience. The wine glass on the left wasn’t expensive – but the design is just right. The cup is pretty, and adds a cheerful touch of colour. Most junk shops have a few quite like it. The package on the right has been tied with style, but brown paper and string won’t break the bank. The knife is second hand; it’s got a nice handle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Chinese bowl and the painting are helpful correctives to the pressure of glamour – which tries to push us in the opposite direction, making us feel we can’t love our lives unless we are doing the fashionable, expensive thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The media is constantly defining the good life in a way that makes it inaccessible to most people. This is extremely unhelpful and untrue, for it turns out that – more wisely considered – many lovely things are, in fact, within our reach. A capacity for appreciation, not money, is the key to a certain kind of calm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Six: The Promotion of Kindness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Fear of humiliation is a fundamental cause of anxiety. And it is based on our assumptions of how other people will react to us in difficult situations. The worry – of course – is that they will be harsh and mean. Our failings and imperfections will be met with mockery or indifference.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2967" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmA.jpg" alt="Football/Everton Investors" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of our agitation stems from the fear of the nastiness of others. So a world in which people are nicer is going to be helpful in a very particular way: it will reduce the fear of failure and humiliation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This realisation takes some of the weight off ourselves. Anxiety about appearance need not be vanity – and hence something that we should berate ourselves for. In fact it is usually caused by the readiness of others to judge on appearances. Worries about status are not the product of our own shallow and crude materialism. They are the logical response to the way in which decent treatment is unfairly handed out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who might belittle you for actually unimportant reasons are, themselves, fraught with insecurity. They threaten to attack because they are so fearful that others will mock them. The promotion of kindness lessens the level of fear of others which circulates in society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Perspective in Space</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We naturally exaggerate our own importance. The incidents of our own lives loom very large in our view of the world. Yet, really, we are minute and entirely dispensable. The world would trundle on much the same without us. It is very helpful to be reduced, from time to time, in our own eyes because this calms the urgent, disturbing (and very normal) sense that it really, really matters what we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2969" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmB.jpg" alt="Somerset night sky" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On an evening walk you look up and see the the planets Venus and Jupiter shining in the darkening sky. If the dusk deepens you might see some stars – Aldebaran, Andromeda, Aries and many others. It’s a hint of the unimaginable extensions of space across the solar system, the galaxy, the cosmos. The sight has a calming effect. Because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes have any relevance. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. For a little while our own lives seem unimportant. But it is not a personal affront. The same applies to everyone: it is levelling, humbling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A related benefit can be drawn from the contemplation of life going on in places far from where we are. If you don’t happen to live in the vicinity, you might be soothed by news from Puerto Montt in Chile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2970" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Puerto Montt</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It lies on the Pacific coast, a two hour flight south of the capital, Santiago. It has a population of 155,000. The weather is mild all year round, though it occasionally freezes in winter. The salmon breeding industry has not been doing well there in recent years. The local soccer team, Deportes, plays in the national Segunda División (they finished seventh last season). There’s a large Unimarc shopping centre near the bus terminal. A bayside restaurant, La Kosina Folkbar, has an excellent reputation for fish and steak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-190314-calmD.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4074" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-190314-calmD.jpg?resize=465%2C398" alt="PM-190314-calmD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The menu today at La Kosina Folkbar</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the people of Puerto Montt, of course, might benefit from contemplating the minor, daily events of the South London suburb of Norwood, or Newark in Delaware, or the Nerima district of Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2972" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmE.jpg" alt="Japan - 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">A soothing image – for the residents of Puerto Montt</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is, essentially, a reminder that life can be lived perfectly well in ways that are quite different from our own. The resentments, longings and ambitions which agitate our days might have very little meaning elsewhere. The totems of local status become ridiculous when seen on a global scale. Sending one’s children to Kambala High School obsesses some parents in Sydney, but has zero cachet in Patagonia. A resident of Glasgow might fret for years paying a big mortgage for the privilege of living in Milngavie. Yet, from a distance, this suburb has no status at all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to be reminded of how little weight our concerns would have when seen from almost anywhere else, for the kindly reason of reducing our anxiety and helping us feel a little calmer about our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Perspective in Time</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the tower of this church in the tiny village of Helmingham was being built, Columbus reached the Caribbean. Stone masons climbed ladders to shape the upper windows while Leonardo da Vinci was experimenting with flying vehicles. Carpenters fitted the beams on the roof as Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, fell. To spend time there is to be reminded – in a very touching and helpful way – of how tiny our existence is in the larger fabric of history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2973" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmF.jpg" alt="PM-190314-calmF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as the expanses of space and geography offer a valuable perspective that takes us out of our local preoccupations, so too the encounter with things that are very old can have a moderating, tranquilising effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should regularly seek out places that speak to us of the extended passage of time. But it’s not enough merely to be in the place. It’s important to actively consider the scale of history, to make oneself think of how much has happened, of how the world has changed. And from there, one is better placed to return to the unavoidable demands of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Distressing levels of agitation are normal. The pursuit of calm is not a way of avoiding engagement with the challenging and difficult parts of existence. An ideal society would systematically calm us down by installing the eight strategies we have discussed over the past few days. Until then, we have to take responsibility for ourselves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s far into the night, but sleep won’t come. You turn over. Perhaps a different position will quieten the mind. Or maybe the other side was better after all. Panic sets in. Not sleeping is a disaster.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For very understandable reasons our culture has arrived at extremely negative assessments of insomnia. It is a curse, to be overcome by art or science, by a sleeping pill, chamomile tea or sheep counting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2460" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070414-insomniaA.jpg?resize=547%2C365" alt="PM-070414-insomniaA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being unable to sleep night after night, for weeks on end, is – of course – hell. But in smaller doses, insomnia does not need a cure. Occasional sleeplessness is an asset, a help with some key troubles of the soul. Crucial things we need may only get a chance to happen during a few active hours in the middle of the night. We should revise our assessment of sleeplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4076" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaB.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="PM-070414-insomniaB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of bed in the middle of the night … raising the prestige of not being able to sleep</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Danish painter Kersting hints at the virtues of the sleepless state. We can guess it’s very late; more conventional people have long ago turned in, but the man has stayed up, to read, to think, to talk with a long-forgotten person: himself. Late at night is when big things may at last have a chance to happen in the mind. Like all the most interesting artists, Kersting is trying to make what really matters glamorous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the day, we are dutiful to others. At night we return to a bigger duty: to ourselves. Night is a corrective to the demands of the community. </span>I may be a dentist or a maths teacher but, long before that happened and still now when I am allowed to commune with myself, I am simply a nameless, limitless consciousness, a far more expansive, un-anchored figure, of infinite possibilities and rare, disturbing, ambivalent, peculiar, visionary insights.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thoughts of night would sound weird to my mother, my friend, my boss, my child. These people need us to be a certain way. They cannot tolerate all our possibilities and for some good reasons. We don’t want to let them down; they have a right to benefit from our predictability. But their expectations shape us, make us who we are, and choke off important aspects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at night, with the window open and a clear sky above, it is just us and the universe – and for a time, we can take on a little of its boundlessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2465" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070414-insomniaD.jpg" alt="PM-070414-insomniaD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">5 a.m. Free, until the first person she knows wakes up…</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t only suffer from spending insufficient time with our true deep selves. We also suffer because we are presented only with the daytime version of other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to have a lot more portraits of what people are like when they are alone, in the dim hours, and their heads are filled with odd (but so normal) thoughts. At two in the morning, the CEO thinks the company is futile – and yet she remains a good CEO. A mother thinks about walking out of her marriage and her family – and yet she will stay and no one need know. A successful novelist wishes he’d never started writing, feels everything he has done is pitiful. And yet he remains an insightful, consoling wordsmith. We need to know that people who are competent, capable and decent will also have (in the privacy of the night) thoughts which are deeply contrary to who we imagine them to be.  Far from being disconcerting, this is properly consoling; a corrective to our debilitating sense of isolation and private madness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s often been assumed that if you draw off the social pressure to be decent and responsible, monstrous parts of the self will emerge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaE1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4993" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaE1.jpg?resize=635%2C491" alt="PM-070414-insomniaE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goya: when we let go of our public identity we are revealed as monsters of selfishness and cruelty</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, social pressure is perhaps also keeping back sweet and delicate aspects of ourselves. We keep them under wraps during the day not because they are so awful, but because they are so liable to be misunderstood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4991" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaF.jpg?resize=635%2C486" alt="PM-070414-insomniaF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We can be rather strange and lonely – together</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Late at night is when the bully recognises that he is cruel from anger and disappointment and that deep down, he is lonely and ashamed. A readiness to admit weakness, error and confusion, a readiness to be ashamed and to be sorry – these are not qualities encouraged by the bright, defensive brittleness of day. Only at night, without fear of consequence or humiliation, we start to regrow the more delicate aspects of our natures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are naturally very inclined to want to be normal. Yet thanks to insomnia, we are granted a crucial encounter with our weirder, truer selves. We can learn of our own apparent strangeness. The daytime self is a misleading picture of what everyone is like. Insomnia is a gift – and a latent education.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                                                          ***</p>
<p class="p1">Insomnia may also provide the perfect occasion on which to think. It’s easy to forget how little strategic thinking ever gets done in the day. Judging by the ideas generated there, our beds have more of a right to be called our offices than our offices. Insomnia is the revenge of the many big thoughts one hasn’t had time to nurture in the daylight hours.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2476" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rushhour.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">8.42am: not a good time for asking the big why questions</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the day, there are a thousand immediate issues to be sorted out. Our minds are dominated by what one could call lower-order questions: what’s the fastest way to get to the meeting in the city centre? How can I get the phone number of the restaurant to book a table for Thursday? What do I say to win the argument with my partner?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AristotleRaphael.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4083" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AristotleRaphael.jpg?resize=429%2C353" alt="AristotleRaphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the start of his ‘Ethics’, Aristotle points out that most of what we do is for the sake of something else. Someone makes a harness – to take his favourite example – so that a horse can be controlled.  That means the cavalry can be more effective. So the general can win the battle. So the statesman can win the war. So the good society can be safe. Therefore, the lower-order activity, like making the harness, can ideally be understood as serving, at a distance, a higher-order concern – like maintaining a good society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy, according to Aristotle, should be focused on the higher-order questions. It doesn’t focus on HOW to do things, so much as on WHY they might be worth doing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the rush of the day, there is no time for the higher-order questions: why do I waste my time with superficial social encounters? Why do I read the newspaper? Why was I so irrationally irritated with the person I profess to love?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At night, however, the ranking of first and second order questions is reversed. In the dark, one may investigate the meaning of work, the needs behind friendship, the mechanics of love. The topics are far from academic. We become philosophers when we chase the practical issues upstream.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RodinPenseur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4085" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RodinPenseur.jpg?resize=635%2C399" alt="RodinPenseur" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The posture is misleading: we’re far more likely to get thinking when lying down in the dark</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s very often ambitions that keep us awake. What am I really trying to do? What’s my life for? We sense and are tormented by our possibilities: how does one make more money, how can one be more effective, how can one make a difference…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These questions are terrifying because, at first, there tends to be no plan of action, simply an ambition waiting to be knocked down by the scepticism and mockery of others. To be turning over such issues and yet be a mere beginner feels like the ultimate arrogance. That is why one needs the protection of the night. Night offers us safety from the scepticism of sensible others. Like childhood, it allows us time to get ourselves together without needing to be always sure or impressive.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2481" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/corbusier.jpg" alt="corbusier" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The architect Le Corbusier’s first sketch of an apartment building for a Parisian street, completed – like a lot of his work – late at night, in bed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle of the night, you don’t have to make your case to a hostile audience. You can run with an idea that, to others, right now, would look feeble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ulysses.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4087" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ulysses.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Ulysses" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An early draft of Ulysses; James Joyce kept getting it wrong. But he kept going – almost always late at night</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most poignant things about artists is their endless capacity for sticking with quite bad, early versions of ideas. The finished, printed pages of James Joyce’s masterpiece Ulysses give no hint of the process by which they were produced. But the manuscript drafts do. We can see the crossed out sentences and paragraphs, the words that had to be shunted about, the passages that just didn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being an artist always involves taking risks with serious imperfection; it means forgiving oneself for the horrors of the first, second and third drafts. In this particular sense, all of us should be artists: not of novels or buildings but of projects in our own lives. We need to keep faith with our goals without choking with disgust at our clumsy early manoeuvres.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is true of art is true of life more generally. To successfully pull off a new business or an office reorganisation has much in common with the production of a novel or an apartment building. Lying in bed, as a delivery lorry trundles along a distant dual carriageway or a car door slams eerily somewhere along the street, we have to risk thinking through the first very, very imperfect version of a large plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Schiller.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4089" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Schiller.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="Schiller" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The German writer and philosopher Friedrich Schiller believed in ‘withdrawing the watchers from the gate’. To be more creative, he suggested that we need to let our stranger, slightly crazy ideas get a hearing. We must not reject too soon. Later comes the business of selecting, ordering and polishing. But creativity involves being unusually willing to entertain the ridiculous and the fragmentary.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to arrive, eventually, at a feasible, defensible strategy. But we all have to start with thoughts that look extremely unimpressive and possibly absurd. Night is a friend to the slow process of maturation that every ambitious project demands: it provides us with the cover to grow into our more complete selves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nasa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5741" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nasa.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="nasa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>A globular cluster, photographed by NASA&#8217;s Hubble telescope</h5>
<p class="p2">Today, like so often, the world seems insane. We need perspective. We need to breathe deeply and climb high above the mantle of the earth, beyond the atmosphere, out into a place of unfathomable silence and majesty.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Globular clusters are dense bunches of hundreds of thousands of stars. They contain some of the oldest surviving stars in the universe. Almost 95 percent of globular cluster formation occurred within the first 1 billion to 2 billion years after our universe was born in the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The picture, taken by the Hubble telescope, says nothing directly about what happened today in our country, it does not refer directly to the murder, the court case, the economic data or to our relationships or the stresses and tribulations of our day to day lives. Its function is to give us access to a state of mind in which we are acutely conscious of the largeness of time and space and our own smallness and weakness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s normally unpleasant to be made to feel small (by a boss or a waiter in a smart establishment), but to be made to feel small by something so much more majestic and powerful than we are has something redeeming and enhancing about it. The image of the globular cluster is sombre, rather than sad; calming, but not despair inducing. And in that condition of mind &#8211; that state of soul, to put it more romantically &#8211; we are left, as so often when we look at the stars, better equipped to deal with with the intense, intractable and particular problems and griefs we have to deal with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tensions in my marriage, the frustrations of my work, the madness of my society, they are all part of the structure of the universe. We have to accept them as we have to accept the explosion of gasses a billion light years away.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some places that seem almost designed to shatter our peace of mind, places where there is too much human chatter and noise, where there is always a screen in view, where the phone rings incessantly, where we can&#8217;t put our problems into perspective. It seems that calm depends to a rather humbling degree on being able to travel, either in person or in our imaginations, to places well suited to dampening our anxieties.</p>
<p>One of the most calming of all such locations is the sea:  a spot (perhaps a bench on a promenade or a patch of grass on top of a cliff) where we can let our thoughts merge with the grandeur and scale of an ocean &#8211; and thereby feel (in the nicest possible way) how much a lot of what worries us doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; in the grander scheme&#8230;</p>

<p>Another traditionally very helpful place is the graveyard, where the sight of graves helps us to remember the brevity of our lives and thereby moves us to reorder priorities.</p>

<p>Part of what adds fuel to our stress is an inability ever to be sufficently alone, and to have a chance to sort out our thoughts. That&#8217;s what can make a long drive an ideal place to wind ourselves down.</p>

<p>What brings supreme calm is space &#8211; being made to feel that we are but a tiny element in something far larger and more mysterious. Deserts know this point well.</p>

<p>And of course, the ones who understand it best are the stars&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is easy, recklessly easy, to get ambitious about happiness; to imagine more fulfilling work, a more satisfying relationship, greater wealth, kinder friends. And then to get sad, because none of that is easy.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is one source of solace, delight and satisfaction that is available in almost every household across the developed world; something we have unproblematic and immediate access to, at minimal cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1749" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathA.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s best when, at first, the water is almost too hot. You venture a foot, then dare yourself to go further and, wincing at the pain, gradually let the water take your whole weight. For the first time today, you don’t have to support yourself anymore, you can at last escape the oppressive force of gravity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind this apparently simple moment, there lie the unheralded efforts of hundreds of thousands of unseen, and now mostly dead, others. Reservoirs were built for this and perhaps dams too, high upstream, stemming the rebellious force of wayward rivers. Gnarled hands laboured to lay the pipes that run like a vascular system underneath the skin of streets to reach the tap that now drips an occasional haunting tear into the steaming water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure is in part psychological. What is ‘outside’ is normally dispiritingly hostile. We have to swaddle our skin in careful layers of wool and cotton – and at night, encase ourselves within sheets and duvets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1750" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathB.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, suddenly, in the bath, like on a very warm summer’s day, none of that is necessary any longer: the outside environment loses its bite. We feel at home in the world, able to take on the outside and win. We can be out there, naked, open, exposed and yet still at ease and warm. The bath emboldens us. There must be echoes in all this of those early quiet months when we first floated in warm water, kicking our legs this way and that, without too many cares. The bath offers a brief instance of reprieve for the pain that must have set in that notorious, traumatic, now-forgotten day (which later on, we’re brave about and ‘celebrate’ as our birthday) when, with a frightening swoosh and a draining of that reassuring liquid, we first emerged into the world – and nothing was ever quite as comfortable again.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Baths are ideal places to think. If we measured them simply on the basis of how many productive ideas we have there, they’d have more right to be called our offices than our offices. Our thoughts generally don’t come when commanded. They run out only when we’re not quite looking, like shy deer – and so they make a dash when we’re daydreaming in a train or letting our minds go fallow in the clear water.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1751" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathC.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Religions have long understood the significance of bathing: they send us into water for the big moments, the so-called ‘watersheds’, to turn over a new leaf, to start afresh, to have another chance. There often remains an echo of those grand ambitions behind our decision to go up and have a bath at the end of an evening. We’re not just looking to get clean. We’re trying to move on from the painful, offensive aspects of the day. We’re hoping the trauma will dissolve and gently loosen itself from us in the water.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of our problems require awkwardly large solutions to stand any chance of being put right. Too often, that then leads us to overlook the passing vital consoling force of more modest consolations that lie to hand, like a hug, or its aquatic sibling, a bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1752" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathD.jpg" alt="1516221a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We tend to reproach ourselves for staring out of the window. You are supposed to be working, or studying, or ticking off things on your to-do list. It can seem almost the definition of wasted time. It seems to produce nothing, to serve no purpose. We equate it with boredom, distraction, futility. The act of cupping your chin in your hands near a pane of glass and letting your eyes drift in the middle distance does not normally enjoy high prestige. We don’t go around saying: ‘I had a great day: the high point was staring out of the window’. But maybe in a better society, that’s just the sort of thing people would say to one another.</p>

<h5 class="p1">Gustave Caillebotte, Young Man at His Window, 1875: Seeking to bring glamour and higher status to an activity which, for centuries has been condemned and denigrated by moralists, teachers, employers, parents – and our own guilty consciences.</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The point of staring out of a window is, paradoxically, not to find out what is going on outside. It is, rather, an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds. It’s easy to imagine we know what we think, what we feel and what’s going on in our heads. But we rarely do entirely. There’s a huge amount of what makes us who we are that circulates unexplored and unused. Its potential lies untapped. It is shy and doesn’t emerge under the pressure of direct questioning. If we do it right, staring out the window offers a way for us to listen out for the quieter suggestions and perspectives of our deeper selves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1737" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rex_PLANE_2982331A.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Plato suggested a metaphor for the mind: our ideas are like birds fluttering around in the aviary of our brains. But in order for the birds to settle, Plato understood that we needed periods of purpose-free calm. Staring out the window offers such an opportunity. We see the world going on: a patch of weeds is holding its own against the wind; a grey tower block looms through the drizzle. But we don’t need to respond; we have no overarching intentions, and so the more tentative parts of ourselves have a chance to be heard, like the sound of church bells in the city once the traffic has died down at night.</p>

<h5><span class="s1">Remembering neglected parts of herself  </span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The potential of daydreaming isn’t recognised by societies obsessed with productivity. But some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful and instead respect the creative potential of reverie. Window daydreaming is a strategic rebellion against the excessive demands of immediate (but ultimately insignificant) pressures – in favour of the diffuse, but very serious, search for the wisdom of the unexplored deep self.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">No one, probably, has ever much doubted that these things are nice. Clouds, trees and streams represent nature in its most gentle, tranquil guise. Their appeal is instinctive. But we take them for granted. They form a pleasant background to other things: out of the plane window, we catch sight of a sea of clouds. Truly lovely – for a moment. Then the cabin crew come around with the sandwiches and you’ve found some episodes of <em>Mad Men</em> you’d missed. Your cousin’s wedding reception was in a garden of old oak trees, they were stunning – but that was two years ago, and you may not have looked properly at a tree since. There was that stream you used to love playing in as a child, damming up the flow till the water eventually protested and swept away your rocks. There must, theoretically, still be lots of streams. But the adult world is often decidedly stream-free.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is a lack of encouragement to focus on these natural elements. In a busy and remorselessly practical age, there are few explanations around as to what the point of such focus might be. And yet spending moments of close observation with clouds, trees and streams may in fact play a minor but important supporting role in the pursuit of a balanced and more or less sane life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CLOUDS </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are preoccupied with ourselves in unhelpful ways. The clouds, however, are usefully indifferent to all our concerns. They don’t care about fashion. They are uninterested in gossip. They are not responsive to our status or lack of it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1726" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3595903a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are always close to these vast, quiet things. A grey tuft detaches itself in the break up of a great continental bank of cloud. It inches its way across the sky, slowly losing definition. Ten minutes later it is barely recognisable. And shortly after that, it merges with another cloud and its brief individual career is over. Islands of clouds form, make chains, nations, empires, then drift and dissolve – like a peaceful, silent, painless repetition of the turbulent mayhem of human history.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a constant drama above our heads: collisions, fractures, swirls, separations… Human life is no less active, but it can mean a moment of relief from our particular involvements to look up and be returned to a broader perspective, from where the agitations of the present moment will seem less significant – as they will for us too with time (even if we are incapable of holding on to this idea on most of the occasions we need it). It will all pass, even the current nastiness and enmities, like the clouds that seemed so fixed and heavy but an hour ago – and yet have now all moved on, leaving behind only two or three of their cohorts, apologetic and timid before the victorious sun, like the cowed remnants of a scattered army.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1727" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3337556a1.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>TREES</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are an image of patience, and resolution. Their gnarled, worn barks speak of the hundreds of seasons they have endured. They have bent and lost branches in November winds, they have been gnawed at by worms and beetles across the airless days of July, they have been knocked and hacked at by farmers and gardeners. But they endure – as we might better learn to do through their examples. It’s an unhelpful prejudice of the Western mind to think of philosophy as emanating only from books rather than, as the Eastern tradition more wisely points out, from the volumes of nature as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1728" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3749387a.jpg" alt="Nature" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Oak trees are an image of ordered complexity: the roots patiently draw nutrients from the soil, the capillaries of their trunks send water twenty-five metres upwards, each branch takes enough but not too much for the needs of its own leaves, each leaf contributes to the maintenance of the whole. The trees sit out rainy days without complaint, adjusting themselves to the slow shift of the seasons – showing no ill-temper in a storm, no desire to wander, with their many slender fingers deep in the clammy soil, metres from their central stems and far from the tallest leaves which hold rainwater in some 40,000 of their little palms.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The trees are an education in the cycle of life as well. All those leaves, resplendent in the summer sun, will be gone by the end of November. Human life is as unstoppable, but it may be through the abstract example of trees that we can come to accept the lesson with greater ease. Our own very disturbing experiences of change are recast in more universal terms. Our thinning hair, facial lines and the stiffening of our skin can be recast as a melancholy necessity rather than an unreasonable catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1729" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3437458a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">STREAMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Streams are always communicating: whispering, exclaiming, arguing (with a rock or twig), confiding (in a quiet vortex), dozing (in midsummer) or shouting (after a heavy shower).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1730" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1217115a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like fires, they provide an ideal object of contemplation for us when we are trying to think. Their constant activity enlivens our imaginations. They don’t stare blankly back at us, like pieces of paper on a desk. They distract our minds just enough that the good ideas, the ones that hate to be asked directly to emerge, can feel relieved of pressure and slip out, while we’re following water as it rises gracefully to meet with the objections of a group of awkward rocks just below the surface. Streams warn us too that we must be careful to hold on to those thoughts, for our minds are no less fugitive than they are: we get an insight, but in a moment, it will be gone, like a twig in the current, unless we grab it at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1731" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/046.jpg" alt="046" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should not leave the encounter with clouds, trees or streams to chance alone. We would ideally have collective routines and events around them to edge us into good habits. Perhaps for a minute before lunch, we would ritually pause and look at the clouds – just as Christians have been encouraged to say a quick prayer of thanksgiving on sitting down to dinner. No week should be counted complete if it does not include three minutes given over to a tree. If streams are hard to come by, a picture of them should be a priority of interior decoration and each of us should make a point of stopping before a ‘stream-icon’ to reacquaint ourselves with its benign and beneficial moral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We too easily lose touch with the better and saner aspects of ourselves. Somewhere inside us, we have the potential for calm and reason, tenderness and thoughtfulness. Clouds, trees and streams are on hand to help…</p>
