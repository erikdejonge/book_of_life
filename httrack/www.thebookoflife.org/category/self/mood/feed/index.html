				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re continually being bombarded with suggestions about what we might do (go jet skiing, study in Colorado, visit the Maldives or see the Pyramids). We’re always hearing of the amazing things friends have done or are going to do: ‘there was this great bar we all went to &#8230;’; ‘she’s getting married in a little country church, then we’re having a picnic&#8230;’; ‘the sun was glinting on Sydney Harbour&#8230;’ There are endless hints of the allure of life in other places: an article about family-friendly restaurants in Brooklyn, a crime novel set in Trieste, the departure board at the airport with its list of places only a plane trip away: Moscow, Bangkok, Addis Ababa… The modern world makes sure we know at all times just how much we’re missing. It is a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) are almost inevitable.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6270" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are, fundamentally, two ways in which the brute facts of missing out can be viewed: one can take a Romantic or a Classical approach.</p>
<p>To the Romantic temperament, missing out causes immense agony. Somewhere else, noble and interesting and attractive people are living exactly the life that should be yours. You’d be so happy, if only you could be over there, at that party, with those people or working in that agency off Washington Square or holidaying in that shack in Jutland. Sometimes it makes you want to burst into tears.</p>
<p>The Romantic believes in the idea of a defined centre where the most exciting things are happening. At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin; then London. Now, it’s probably San Francisco and in five years it may be Auckland – or perhaps Rio.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3233070.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5881" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3233070.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="El Morocco New Year" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For the Romantic, humanity is divided into a large group of the mediocre – and a tribe of the elect: artists, entrepreneurs, the edgy part of the fashion world and the people doing creative things with tech. As a Romantic, it can be exhausting inside your soul. Your mother sometimes drives you nuts: her life is utterly dull. How can she accept it? Why isn’t she itching to move to the Bay area? She’s always suggesting you take a job in Birmingham or inviting you on walking holidays in the Lake District. Sometimes you are quite rude to her. You avoid certain people like the plague: the shy friend from school who struggles with their weight; the flatmate who’s a telecoms engineer and wants to go into local politics. Being around individuals who are so unglamorous and lacking in ambition can feel pretty fatal.</p>
<p>For their part, classically-minded people acknowledge that there are of course some genuinely marvellous things going on in the world, but they doubt that the obvious signs of glamour are a good guide to finding them. The best novel in the world, they like to think, is probably not currently winning prizes or storming up the bestseller lists. It may be being written at this moment by an arthritic woman living in the otherwise unremarkable Latvian town of Liepāja.</p>
<p>Classical people are intensely aware that good qualities coexist with some extremely ordinary ones. Everything is rather jumbled up. Lamentable taste in jumpers is compatible with extraordinary insight. Academic qualifications can give no indication of true intelligence. Famous people can be dull. Obscure ones can be remarkable. At a perfect launch party, drinking sandalwood cocktails at the coolest bar in the world, you could feel sad and anxious. You might have the deepest conversations of you life with your aunt – even though she likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dying her hair.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/484149705.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5883" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/484149705.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="Elderly Care" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The classical temperament also fears missing out but has a rather different list of things they are afraid of not enjoying: getting to truly know one’s parents, learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; discovering what their favourite pieces of music really mean to them, chatting to a seven year old child&#8230; As these wise souls know, one can indeed miss out on such extremely important things if one is always rushing a little too intently to find excitement elsewhere, heading off in haste to that stylish bar with the see-through elevator packed with some of the city’s top creatives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Alongside the notes of the musical keyboard and the letters of the alphabet, colours provide the building blocks of our emotions. It is not for nothing that we say we are ‘feeling blue’ or ‘seeing red’. Each colour is subtly connected to a web of experiences and associations. Some of these are highly idiosyncratic: a particular yellow might remind us of a long-dead grandmother’s kitchen or a pair of boots we had as children. But others carry more universal meanings. Exploring the associations we have around colours is a way to get to understand ourselves and, as importantly, gives us a way to tell others who we are.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">YELLOW: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">HOPE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yellow is carefree and confident. It’s not on the defensive. It acts as a shield against despair and feelings of humiliation. It’s eager for our attention, like a happy child delighted to be at the centre of things. At times, its energy can be oppressive, but like its most famous ambassador – the lemon – there are few things it won’t enhance. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe loved yellow, considering it to be the colour of a gently hopeful attitude to life. He owned a collection of twenty yellow waistcoats, which he always twinned with white trousers – for he loved a little serenity as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory1.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4130" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory1.jpeg?resize=635%2C487" alt="William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Joseph Mallord William Turner, <em>Light and Colour (Goethe&#8217;s Theory)</em>, 1843 </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ORANGE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">VITALITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Orange is a little more mature, strong and threatening than its neighbour and sibling, yellow. It almost tips over into something frightening. There is much of it in the boiling interior of the sun. Yet in the correct dose, it seems like a concentration of an energy and vitality that too often we lack in our own minds and circumstances. To give over an entire room, car, flag or garment to this colour may be risky, as it can verge on extremity and obsession, and yet to deny the occasional wisdom of the colour seems wrong as well. We should know how to build in moments of what orange represents into a well-balanced life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT RED: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">ADVENTURE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A bright, light red is adventurous, witty, even a touch heartless. It’s not too bothered by what others think. And that’s a tonic when, as is so often the case, we are excessively anxious about the opinions of other people. Light red is not harsh, just independent. It’s more interested in being followed than in being a follower. It’s the colour of your banner when you feel you can take on the world (or some part of it that matters to you).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_Portrait_de_Napoléon_Bonaparte_en_premier_consul1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4132" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_Portrait_de_Napoléon_Bonaparte_en_premier_consul1.jpg?resize=635%2C473" alt="Jean_Auguste_Dominique_Ingres_Portrait_de_Napoléon_Bonaparte_en_premier_consul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres, <em>Bonaparte, First Consul</em>, 1804</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK RED: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">POWER</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of France in 1804, he wore a splendid crimson velvet cloak. This is the colour of thrones, of cardinals, of power and pomp, of ceremony and feasts. Dark red is sympathetic to authority and favours the idea of maturity. It is assertive and assured, and can function as a reminder of a more demanding, insistent attitude when, through misfortune or our own mistakes, we falter. It speaks to the fragment of a Napoleonic attitude buried in everyone’s soul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">VIOLET: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">AMBIGUITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Violet is red that has almost been transformed into blue. It holds a little onto both, it remembers both, which makes it mysterious, ambiguous and suggestive. Early Renaissance artists liked to depict angels, busy on errands of mercy between heaven and earth, as wearing violet gowns. The colour evoked for them the idea of an infinite ‘beyond’ that was not threatening or dangerous, somewhere we could long for but which remained always just out of sight.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/208-2-592x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4134" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/208-2-592x10241.jpg?resize=592%2C556" alt="208-2-592x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paolo Veronese, <em>The Dream of Saint Helena,</em> 1570</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT BLUE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">CLARITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Light blue is inescapably the colour of a clear, morning sky – with a cool hint, perhaps, of the north or the mountainside. It’s a colour for being active. It’s undaunted, cheerful, ready to get on and face all the things you’ve been putting aside. Shadows, confusion, doubts and second thoughts go into hiding when light blue appears. It is never cruel, just filled with breezy goodwill. It is logical, clear. It admires the simple, straightforward statement. It wants you to tidy your desk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK BLUE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">DISCIPLINE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the colour of order and discipline. It tells us not to give up, to search for reserves of resilience. It is resolute, reliable. Dark blue doesn’t get sidetracked. It sticks to the key task, to the big point. It keeps the end in view. Strong rather than hard; courageous rather than fierce, it is civilised and directed. It is power on our side, protective and helpful. It is the colour of a good, true father.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT GREEN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">SANITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Light green has the fresh, natural feel of sanity. It is summoned when we are grateful rather than envious. When we don’t need to do down others to feel good about ourselves, and when we are more interested in finding out how things go well rather than complaining when they don’t turn out quite right. We can use this colour to help us focus on our power to do something – rather than blame others for our failings or doubt our strengths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul Cézanne, <em>Etang des Soeurs at Osny</em>, 1875</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK GREEN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">REALISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The soothing realms of deeper, greyer green are about realism. This word sometimes has unfortunate associations, as though it was the opposite of hope, but in fact, there’s such a thing as mature, realistic hope. This emotion tells us that things are tough, but that the worst will pass, that what we have may be good enough, that we will manage and cope despite inevitable frustrations and compromises. This is hope that has acquired a proper knowledge of the troubles of life – but hasn’t given up. It pulls us back to sobriety, to patience and moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT BROWN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">MELLOWNESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a colour that does not want to draw attention to itself. It is conscious of times past, and feels their wistful tug. It likes quiet. It is meditative and gentle. But it is not about putting us to sleep. Light brown is our friend when we want to calm down and avoid external stimulation, so that the quieter, smaller voices of the inner world – the half memories, the tentative associations, the delicate starting moments of a new thought – can be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng_ng_ng1272_large1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4136" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng_ng_ng1272_large1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="(c) The National Gallery, London; Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Constable, <em>Cenotaph to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds</em>, 1833-6</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK BROWN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">DIGNITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dignity means not having to try to impress. You are sure of yourself – of who you are, and what you stand for. It might be the colour of an old mahogany table, with a clock ticking quietly in the background. Time is slow and ample, there’s no rush, no haste. Dark brown is not a hectic colour – it’s the shade of comfort or dark soil on a wet day. Not glamorous, but deeply good and reassuring. It is solid and dependable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">BLACK: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black is the perennial colour of fashion and sophistication in the modern world. It is strong, without illusions. It flirts with cynicism. It is the least naive, the least childish of colours. We need black when we want to keep our cool; we’ve seen too much already to get carried away now. It is a reminder of the appeal of being a little bit harsh, a little bit demanding and decisive. Black is lean.</span></p>
<p class="p1">**</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us haven&#8217;t owned a nice box of coloured pencils since we were children. Yet no adult life should be without one, because having a suite of hues at our fingertips provides a route to a wide array of moods and inspirations.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/the-psychology-of-colour/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4138" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aw14_tsol_website-8-635x4191.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="aw14_tsol_website-8-635x419" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We could do worse when getting close to another person than to use each of these pencils in turn and discuss what its colour symbolises for us. And when wondering what mood we are in, we might pick a pencil without thinking too much, doodle with it and dwell on what our choice tells us of our state of mind.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was a sunny Sunday afternoon; you were nine years old. Your parents wouldn’t let you have any ice cream if you didn’t do your maths homework. It was achingly unfair. Every other child in the world was playing football or watching television. No one else has such a mean mother. It was just awful.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learned self-pity when we were young. We’re all – in theory – dead against it. Self-pity is deeply unattractive because it reveals egoism in its most basic form, a failure to put our own suffering into proper perspective against the larger backdrop of human history. It shows how easily our own stubbed toe might matter more than a million dead in a far-off land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3573" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Gustave Courbet, <em>The Desperate Man</em>, 1845</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one is likely to own up to feeling self-pity. And yet, if we are honest, in some shape or other it lingers for a long, long time, and that’s understandable. It reflects the paradoxical necessity of having to look after ourselves, of having to be on our side, even though we are not necessarily always the most deserving or the most pitiable candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we encounter self-pity (in a friend, a family member – or even ourselves), there’s a temptation to get very stern. Self-pity is regarded as a rather awful failing, and anyone caught up in it must be forcibly reminded how very lucky they really are. How dare they moan about having to do homework? Don’t they realise there are children with terrible diseases who’d love to be doing maths homework? Haven’t got a job you like? Stop moaning: think of people working the Ndassima gold mine in the Central African Republic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/451638144.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3574" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/451638144.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Ndassima gold mine in Central African Republic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in order to deal better with self-pity (whether in ourselves or others) we have to keep in mind something which this well-meaning – but sadly ineffective – strategy misses. It’s that self-pity starts out as a very important achievement. Imagine what things would be like if we couldn’t pity ourselves. If you think of a parent comforting a child, they are in effect teaching the child how to look after themselves. Gradually we learn to internalise this parental attitude and come to be able to feel sorry for ourselves when no one else will. It’s not necessarily entirely rational, but it’s a coping mechanism. A first protective shell which we develop in order to be able to manage some of the immense disappointments and frustrations that life throws at us. The defensive posture of self-pity isn’t inherently contemptible. It is grounded in something rather touching and useful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not in the least surprising that we try to keep very painful facts about our own inadequacy and failure at bay. The issue is how one might slowly evolve away from self-pity and here the answer is, always, only through an atmosphere of supportiveness and gentleness. Very few of us ever improve our characters by being shouted at. Self-pity is wisely addressed not by condemnation but by the kind suggestion of better perspective and fair criticism: perhaps one did do something a little wrong, perhaps this won’t seem like such a problem, tomorrow morning… If this can be taken on board, then the need to ward off failure or to avoid responsibility is lessened. Self-pity no longer feels required. We learn through reassurance, not bracing reproof – however precise the condemnation may be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4141" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg?resize=635%2C516" alt="703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Raphael, Madonna in the Meadow, 1506</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path out of self-pity involves an arc of development. We come to recognise that other people are not always being especially hard on us when they find us wanting. And we come to realise that our sufferings take place within a broad context of unhappiness. Far from meaning that our suffering doesn’t matter, it’s rather the case that all suffering matters and can unite the afflicted into a giant collective, who might – when they have time to look up from their own sorrows – feel pity for one another. Suffering doesn’t have to isolate, it can also bring us together. As we leave self-pity behind we enter a world in which suffering is a constant and failure is the norm. We have not been singled out. Indeed, when we look back from this higher place, we don’t have to find even self-pity so strange or deplorable. This primitive defence mechanism – blaming others and exaggerating one’s woes – is itself deserving of a degree of compassion: of pity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s true progress here and the attainment of a state of mind that should be dignified with a special name: higher consciousness. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Irritability is the tendency to get upset for reasons that seem – to other people – to be pretty minor. Your partner asks you how work went and the way they ask makes you feel intensely agitated. Your partner is putting knives and forks on the table before dinner and you mention (not for the first time) that the fork should go on the left hand side, not the right. They then immediately let out a huge sigh and sweep the cutlery onto the floor and tell you that you can xxxx-ing do it yourself if you know better. It was the most minor of criticisms and technically quite correct. And now they’ve exploded.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is so much irritability around and it exacts a huge daily cost on our collective lives, so we deserve to get a lot more curious about it: what is really going on for the irritable person? Why, really, are they getting so agitated? And instead of blaming them for getting het up about ‘little things’, we should do them the honour of working out why, in fact, these things may not be so minor after all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The journey begins by recognising the role of fear in irritability in couples. Behind most outbursts are cack-handed attempts to teach the other person something. There are things we’d like to point out, flaws that we can discern, remarks we feel we really must make, but our awareness of how to proceed is panicked and hasty. We give cack-handed, mean speeches, which bear no faith in the legitimacy (even the nobility) of the act of imparting advice. And when our partners are on the receiving end of these irritable ‘lessons’, they of course swiftly grow defensive and brittle in the face of suggestions which seem more like mean-minded and senseless assaults on their very natures rather than caring, gentle attempts to address troublesome aspects of joint life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/50660304.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3568" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/50660304.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Exasperated teacher at public grade scho" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The prerequisite of calm in a teacher is a degree of indifference as to the success or failure of the lesson. One naturally wants for things to go well, but if an obdurate pupil flunks trigonometry, it is – at base – their problem. Tempers can stay even because individual students do not have very much power over teachers’ lives. Fortunately, as not caring too much turns out to be a critical aspect of successful pedagogy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet this isn’t an option open to the fearful, irritable lover. They feel ineluctably led to deliver their ‘lessons’ in a cataclysmic, frenzied manner (the door slams very loudly indeed) not because they are insane or vile (though one could easily draw these conclusions) so much as because they are terrified; terrified of spoiling what remains of their years on the planet in the company of someone who it appears cannot in any way understand a pivotal point about conversation, or cutlery, or the right time to order a taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One knows intuitively, when teaching a child, that only the utmost care and patience will ever work: one must never shout, one has to use extraordinary tact, one has to make ten compliments for every one negative remark and one must leave oneself plenty of time…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/107653969.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3569" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/107653969.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="African Leadership Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this wisdom we reliably forget in love’s classroom, sadly because increasing the level of threat seldom hastens development. We do not grow more reasonable, more accepting of responsibility and more accurate about our weaknesses when our pride has been wounded, our integrity is threatened and our self-esteem has been violated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The complaint against the irritable person is that they are getting worked up over ‘nothing’. But symbols offer a way of seeing how a detail can stand for something much bigger and more serious. The groceries placed on the wrong table are not upsetting at all in themselves. But symbolically they mean your partner doesn’t care about domestic order; they muddle things up; they are messy. Or the question about one’s day is experienced as a symbol of interrogation, a lack of privacy and a humiliation (because one’s days rarely go well enough).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution is, ideally, to concentrate on what the bigger issue is. Entire philosophies of life stir and collide beneath the surface of apparently petty squabbles. Irritations are the outward indications of stifled debates between competing conceptions of existence. It’s to the bigger themes we need to try to get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the course of discussions, one might even come face-to-face with that perennially surprising truth about relationships: that the other person is not an extension of oneself that has, mysteriously, gone off message. They are that most surprising of things, a different person, with a psyche all of their own, filled with a perplexing number of subtle, eccentric and unforeseen reasons for thinking as they do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decoding may take time, perhaps half an hour or more of concentrated exploration for something that had until then seemed as if it would more rightfully deserve an instant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We pay a heavy price for this neglect; every conflict that ends in sour stalemate is a blocked capillary within the heart of love. Emotions will find other ways to flow for now, but with the accumulation of unresolved disputes, pathways will fur and possibilities for trust and generosity narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3230446.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3570" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3230446.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="The Milkman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A last point. It may just be sleep or food: when a baby is irritable, we rarely feel the need to preach about self-control and a proper sense of proportion. It’s not simply that we fear the infant’s intellect might not quite be up to it, but because we have a much better explanation of what is going on. We know that they’re acting this way – and getting bothered by any little thing – because they are tired, hungry, too hot or having some challenging digestive episode.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, though, that the same physiological causes get to us all our lives. When we are tired, we get upset more easily; when we feel very hungry, it takes less to bother us. But it is immensely difficult to transfer the lesson in generosity (and accuracy) that we gain around children and apply it to someone with a degree in business administration or a pilot’s license, or to whom we have been married for three-and-a-half years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should try to see irritability for what it actually is: a confused, inarticulate, often shameful attempt to get us to understand how much someone is suffering and how urgently they need our help. We should – when we can manage it – attempt to help them out.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Melancholy is not exactly a word on everybody’s lips. People don’t go around gossiping about how melancholic the new regional IT director is or drawing up lists of the more melancholy-inducing bits of natural scenery (Brighton Beach on an overcast morning; Rannoch Moor in Scotland; the West Siberian Plain). But we should pay more attention to melancholy and even seek it out from time to time.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8669804322_2500bb9ec7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8906" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/8669804322_2500bb9ec7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="8669804322_2500bb9ec7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult and that suffering and disappointment are core parts of universal experience. It’s not a disorder that needs to be cured. Modern society tends to emphasise buoyancy and cheerfulness. But we have to admit that reality is for the most part about grief and loss. The good life is not one immune to sadness, but one in which suffering contributes to our development. Sometimes you feel sad and you can’t quite put your finger on why. It’s not one acute sorrow that’s eating you. You feel in a way the whole of life calls for tears.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy is a key mental state and a valuable one, because it links pain with beauty and wisdom. Our suffering isn’t merely chaotic – a mark of failure, an error – it can be linked to admirable things. Often, sadness simply makes a lot of sense. </span>We feel melancholy when we consider that the things we love are transient. Yesterday will never come back. Every day you take a step nearer to death. The people who cared for us when we were young are getting older. We’ll be following their path to decline soon enough.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3202" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/13805406699.jpg" alt="13805406699" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Ansel Adams, Aspens, Dawn, Autumn, Dolores River Canyon, Colorado, 1937; t</span>he darker truths of the human condition</em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one truly understands anyone else, loneliness is basic, universal. Every life has its full measure of shame and sorrow. We spend our lives striving for things we mostly don’t get – and if we do, we are soon disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4009625102_4c21c3b500_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8908" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4009625102_4c21c3b500_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4009625102_4c21c3b500_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">They’ll grow up; they’ll encounter money worries, the difficulty of making a career, addictions, political conflict, illnesses and relationship frustrations.</span></strong></em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, nothing we do matters. Our lives – our loves and cares, our griefs, our triumphs – will be washed away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3204" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/138054074410.jpg" alt="138054074410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hiroshi Sugimoto, North Atlantic Ocean, Cliffs of Moher, 1989: </span>Regrets</em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the things you should have said to your grandmother before she died. We learn too late. You have wasted years. Everyone has. You can only avoid regret by switching off your imagination, by refusing to consider how things might have been.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Many of the things we most want are in conflict: to feel secure, and yet to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be wage slaves. To be in close knit communities and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of others. To travel and explore the world and yet to put down deep roots. To fulfil the demands of our appetites for food, drink, sex and lying on the sofa – and yet stay thin, sober, faithful and fit.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wisdom of the melancholy attitude (as opposed to the bitter or angry one) lies in the understanding that the sorrow isn’t just about you, that you have not been singled out, that your suffering belongs to humanity in general. So often our sorrows are egocentric. We see them as special misfortunes which have come our way. Melancholy rejects this. It has a wider, much less personal take. Much of what is painful and sorrowful in our lives can be traced to general things about life: its brevity; the fact that we cannot avoid missing opportunities, the contradictions of desire and self-management. These apply to everyone. So melancholy is generous. You feel this sorrow for others too, for ‘us’. You feel pity for the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2">And feeling such pity makes us better people. It offers to make our expectations of human conduct more accurate. Whoever I am with will suffer the same broad difficulties. It is hardly surprising if they go off the rails, get frazzled, lie from time to time, change their minds for no good reason (or refuse to change their minds when there is good reason). We are melancholy when we grasp that there are deep troubles essentially bound up with being human. And to take that fully to heart is to become more compassionate.</p>

</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Religions have been advocates of melancholy. The Christian Book of Common Prayer gives a statement to be recited at funerals:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower. In the midst of life we are in death.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s intended to strike home a universal, melancholy thought. At the funeral of a loved one we are not just witnessing the passing of one life. We are invited to see each other – and ourselves – as dying animals. This should not make us desperate, but rather more forgiving, kinder and better able to focus on what really matters, while there is still time.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Not least, melancholy is attractive. There are many types of beauty and many ways of being sexy. But at certain periods of history some major possibilities get neglected. Our age is prone to overlook one of the central sources of sexual allure. Melancholy sexiness goes beneath today’s radar because we’re dominated by the idea that to attract the world, to give the world what it wants from us, we have to exude good cheer. But consider some of the following:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is, of course, a form of madness. You pick up the largest jam jar and fling it to the floor. You go up to the attendant at the counter and deliver a stream of obscenities. You accelerate and overtake on a narrow country lane bordered by oak trees.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However insane these moments seem, it is not right to dismiss them as merely beyond understanding. They operate according to an underlying rationale which needs to be grasped for anger to be controlled and extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anger begins with the many imperfections of existence: the internet connection has failed, the plane is delayed again, someone is driving too slowly. It is fair enough to take a negative view of these things. But in order for them to make us angry – rather than merely sad – there is something else at work: we break, kick, slam and accelerate because we are, at some level, horribly optimistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/55318275.jpg" alt="Protestors Rally In Support Of Katrina Evacuees At White House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the angry may seem negatively predisposed to life, they are in their hearts recklessly hopeful. Recklessly because how badly we react to frustration is critically determined by what we think of as normal. We may be irritated that it is raining, but our pessimistic accommodation to the likelihood of showers means we are unlikely ever to respond to one by screaming. Our annoyance is tempered by what we understand we can expect from the climate, by our melancholy experience of what it is normal to hope for from the skies. We aren’t overwhelmed by anger whenever we don’t get something we want; we do so only when we first believed ourselves fundamentally entitled to secure it – and then oddly did not. Our greatest furies spring from events which violate our sense of the ground-rules of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141555142.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4153" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141555142.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="Trilussa Observing A Bicycle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The angry are hence operating with the wrong sense of what is normal: the person who shouts every time they lose their house keys betrays a faith, touching were it not so counter-productive, that their belongings should simply never go astray. The person who loses their temper when stuck behind a slow driver evinces a curious (were it not so dangerous) belief that country roads should always be mysteriously traffic-free.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So calm has to begin with pessimism. We must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before the world has a chance to slap us by surprise, when our defences are down. The angry must be systematically inducted to the darkest realities of life, to the stupidities of others, to the ineluctable failings of technology, to the necessary flaws of infrastructure… – all this while there is still time. They should start each day with a short but thorough meditation on the many humiliations and insults to which the coming hours risk subsequently subjecting them, from a car accident to the accidental destruction of the hard-drive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The angry are, also, deeply scared. They may seem bullishly confident in their rage, but they are smashing things up out of panic. They have no faith in their own capacity to survive frustration and recover equanimity despite some perhaps truly significant losses. They lack a resilient sense of how – with sufficient patience, love and time – error and damage may be repaired, borne and overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2346" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/50968742.jpg" alt="Personnel Problems" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This mixture of hope and fear reaches its apogee in the fury witnessed in relationships. Partners who might have been deeply patient with people all day, who may have dealt politely with the flaws of multiple colleagues and clients, will lose their tempers in volcanic ways when faced with the minor failings of their beloveds (‘How was your day?’ asked a little too dismissively perhaps). Behind the rage is a combustible mixture of hope – ‘this is the person who is meant to understand me’ – and fear; that one has settled down with the wrong human being, and has therefore ruined one’s life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind their outbursts, the angry are trying to teach the world things: how to run an airline, how to drive, how to make decent dinner-time conversation… However, they are exceptionally bad teachers because too much is at stake for them. They lack the basic psychological resource of good teachers: a relative indifference to the success or failure of their lessons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to laugh at the angry (when we are not terrified of their blows). But when we can manage it, we should bear in mind that their anger is grounded in attitudes and hopes that may deserve sympathy rather than just scorn. The bulging eyes, the raised voices and the harsh phrases occur when an intense sense of justice and urgent practical energy meet the conviction (in fragile and vulnerable beings) that they will not be understood or listened to if they try to explain their disappointments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given what has caused the outburst in the first place, to calm down the angry person tends only ever to require three things: a ready declaration that we too are extremely disappointed, a sympathetic insistence that we so wish it could be otherwise and a magnanimous and convincingly-delivered assurance that we are truly sure they will get through this.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s normal to think that what makes people cry are sad things; that’s certainly the way it works when you’re a child. But the older one gets, the more one starts to notice a strange phenomenon: one starts crying not when things are horrible (one toughens up a little), but when they are suddenly and unexpectedly precisely the opposite, when they are unusually sweet, tender, joyful, innocent or kind. This, far more than grimness, is what may increasingly prompt tears.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You notice this particularly with films. The scenes that make us weep are not necessarily the harrowing or terrifying ones, but the ones when we encounter a particular grace and loveliness which can, for a moment, feel heartbreaking. Take Richard Linklater’s recent film,<em> Before Midnight</em>. Most of the film is about bitter arguments between a 40-something couple, played by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. They have been together for years, they are on holiday in Greece, and the film homes in on one day when the pair go and spend some supposed ‘quality time’ alone in a smart hotel. They arrive in their room with the possibility of sex somewhere in both of their minds but instead, find themselves having a blazing argument. They rake up all the hurt from past years; they blame each other for every disappointment and swear at, and insult, one other with abandon.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2508" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryA.jpg" alt="BEFORE MIDNIGHT - Jan 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“Find someone else to put up with your shit. You’re fucking awful to be with, you know”</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2509" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryB.png" alt="PM-200314-cryB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“I don’t love you anymore. I hate you, you’ve ruined my whole fucking life”</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Eventually, the wife storms out, leaving her room key and her husband behind. It is agonisingly real (how does the film maker know this about our lives?). But, after a few hours of sulking, Hawke goes out in search of Delpy and finds her alone in a nearby restaurant terrace. They are both a little sheepish around each other, as one often is after a row, and he sits down opposite her with poignant formality.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a beautiful closing sequence, they start to talk with unusual honesty. It’s difficult, but we can see that, despite everything (kids, too many sacrifices, exhaustion, not enough sex, perhaps a one-night stand or two) they do still love and desire each other very much. Their rage is an explosion of the frustration inherent within all long-term relationships. They get so deeply upset because they know that, day to day, they need so much from one another and they don’t always get it. They’re not magically going to stop bickering in the future. But this moment of kindness and sympathy, playfulness and gentleness, after such a bruising confrontation, comes as a huge relief and is deeply tender to behold. Their admission of shared love is moving because it reminds us at once of the struggles in our own lives and of what at heart we really want: reconciliation, forgiveness, tenderness, an end to the fighting, a chance to say sorry… We start to cry at a brief vision of a state of grace from which we’re exiled most of the time.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2510" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryC.jpg" alt="Before Midnight - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m sorry. We both are. You drive me crazy, but I love you like I always did”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take another example from another medium and from further back in history: a small ivory statuette of the Virgin and Child – it is just 41 cm high – in the Louvre in Paris, dating from about 1250.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200314-cryD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4155" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200314-cryD.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="PM-200314-cryD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most striking feature is the mother’s face: one of welcome and joy; the kind of look we hope to receive when someone is unreservedly glad to see us. Mary’s charm and kindness may give rise to poignant emotions. We feel this is how life should be, this is what love looks like and what we should be giving to one another. But at the same time, we know it’s not easy; we’re pained by an acute sense that our lives are not usually like this. We may ache for all the lost innocence of the world (and of our own lives). Loveliness and goodness in art (at the Louvre, or in a children’s book, or on a screen) can make the actual ugliness of existence all the more vivid. And that’s precisely why we cry at this poignant reminder of an elusive paradise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s also why, if we were to consider the unusual project of creating a robot that could cry in films, with books or at the museum, we should have to do something apparently rather cruel: we would have to ensure that this robot knew about suffering, that it was able to hate itself, to feel confused and frustrated, to ache and hope that it didn’t have to ache; for it is against this kind of background of pain and sober maturity that beautiful scenes in films or works of art become deeply important, rather than merely nice. Our tears are telling us something key: that our lives are tougher than they used to be when we were little, and that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is correspondingly all the more intense.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine a sunny day, one in which many people, on walking out of the house for the first time, will note a particular brightness to the light, and a balminess to the air, which may trigger a surge of hope and a willingness to look at familiar problems with renewed determination.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1815" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/summer1.jpg" alt="Hot weather in London, Britain - 19 Jun 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure that can be triggered by good weather is, at one level, absurd. Gratitude for the sun belongs to a category of satisfaction that feels humiliatingly simple. It’s tempting to deny the significance of the weather altogether – especially for philosophers – and to focus instead on more substantial political and economic issues, by which the course of our lives is overwhelmingly determined. We should surely be able to rise above minor frustrations like eleven days of rain and a persistent glacial wind from the north.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in reality, our behaviour reveals a devotion to a simple, even simplistic, truth: our faith in ourselves and our prospects is frequently determined by nothing grander than the number of photons of light in the sky and degrees of warmth in the air. Heat, pleasant breezes, intense sunlight and fresh flowers may play a critical role in encouraging us not to give up on things.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1816" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/summer2.jpg" alt="Weather Pics In Hyde Park... Sunbathers Making The Most Of The English Summer." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being told that one’s view of life is – at a given moment – not the product of economic or moral conditions but of a lack of light (or indigestion or exhaustion) is from a certain angle intensely demeaning. There is an impulse to believe that our woes must be of a more weighty kind. Yet the truth is more subtle: to be happy, it seems we require some extremely large things (money, employment, freedom, love), but we also rely on a raft of peculiarly small things too. Babies know this second part of the equation very well, which is why it should never be an insult for someone to point out just how much we continue to have in common with these creatures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Doubts about feeling pleased at a blue sky are ultimately a consequence of accidental snobbery. We may look down on a sunny scene which, if it were presented to us in a museum, we would take extremely seriously. If we went on a special trip to the Musee d’Orsay in Paris to see Monet’s paintings, we would hardly think we were doing something low-brow. Yet when we look at his beautiful <em>Wild Poppies, near Argenteuil</em> we are – in many respects – experiencing much the same thing as when we appreciate a spring scene on our way to work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/monet.jpg" alt="monet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just that when a frame is put around an emotion, we are much more generous to it (and to ourselves) and appreciative of what it has to offer. Monet was a great artist in part because he knew how to draw our attention, and lend dignity to minor natural phenomena in danger of being overlooked in a heedless technocratic world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If joy at fine weather is worrying to people of taste and intellectual sophistication, it is because of a fear that paying attention to pretty skies will mean one forgets the actual conditions of life: war, disease, poverty and political evil. But for most of us, the greatest risk we face is not in fact complacency; few of us are likely to be able to forget the human chaos for any length of time. Indeed, the real risk is not sentimental naivety; it is that we are going to fall into fury, despair and unshakeable depression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is this eventuality that a sunny day is well suited to correct. Flowers in spring, blue skies, children running in the park… these are crucial symbols of hope. Scenes where no one is dying or suffering, where the air is warm, where there is an absence of sickness and in which everyday, quiet, ordinary contentment is glimpsed… this is anything but banal. Given the facts of life, cheerfulness is a phenomenal achievement – and the sunny days that occasionally lie behind it are bearers of their own particular and highly significant wisdom.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On holiday in the Caribbean, Cameron Diaz has been undertaking philosophical experiments. She is investigating how middle-aged people can be happy without working, spending money or trying to have sex.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her experiments have been guided by the observation that small children are usually far happier than adults. One reason is that a child of six leaps around up to 3,000 times more a year than the average 46-year-old and, when doing so, frequently emits sounds of unrestrained joy like ahayhaaa and woohieeee. Can adults learn something from this? A Hollywood star investigates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4157" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazA.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Leaping</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their forties, people almost never jump from small rocks into shallow water. It’s not at all necessary to do this outdoors, let alone in the Caribbean. A sofa or bed and a thick carpet work just as well. Maybe better in some ways. Getting the arms up in the air is crucial. When older people leap they tend to hold back and keep their arms down by their sides, or they do a half-hearted thing – kind of clenching their fists and keeping them near their chests. Unfortunately this reduces the pay-off quite a bit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4158" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazB.jpg?resize=635%2C500" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sand running</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most adults look silly when they run in very soft sand. Your feet sink in so much it looks as if you are staggering. Which means we get reluctant to do it. But that’s a great pity because sand running is one of the surest ways of raising the spirits. The indoor version involves putting cushions and pillows in a line across a room and darting back and forth along them. Happiness can have some remarkably unintellectual, achievement-free foundations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazC-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4160" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazC-2.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Splashing</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then there’s chest-splashing. Many adults find splashing of all kinds difficult. You worry about water getting in your eyes or onto something precious lying nearby. Cameron may have practised in the bath for a while.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4161" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazD.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Selfie-ing</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for photos, you’d think there could be nothing simpler than taking a few of yourself and chuckling over the result. But over the age of forty it’s not so easy. You worry about how you look. The signs of ageing are always there. The inner critic is always saying – what’s happened to my chin? Does my mouth really look like that? Where did that wrinkle come from? It’s a real battle between fun and vanity. So often we try to control our appearance because we’re worried about what other people will think of us. It’s a kind of phobia. But by repeated exposure to slightly silly and disappointing pictures of yourself, you can actually get used to it. It bothers you less. You mature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cameron Diaz was not necessarily conscious of her own investigations into the sources of contentment.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, like most days, you are anxious. It is there in the background, always present, sometimes more to the fore, sometimes less so, but never truly banished – at least not for longer than an evening. The anxiety appears to be about some very particular things: the party where you won’t know many people, the complicated trip you have to take to some unfamiliar hotels, the direction of your career, the drilling outside, the email problem, the claustrophobic interior of the plane, your digestive system…</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But considered from a broader perspective, the problem for us is larger, more damning and a great deal more fundamental. Beyond any specific thing we happen to be worrying about, looked at over time, a greater conclusion is inescapable: we simply are anxious, to our core, in the very basic make-up of our being. Though we may focus day-to-day on this or that particular worry creating static in our minds, what we are really up against is anxiety as a permanent feature of life, something irrevocable, existential, dogged – and responsible for ruining a dominant share of our brief time on earth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tortured by anxiety, we naturally fall prey to powerful fantasies about what might – finally – bring us calm. At certain points, especially in the north, the fantasies latch on to travel.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2303" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/162243357.jpg" alt="Travel Destination: Maldive Islands" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, at last, there would be peace: under the clear blue sky, on the island eleven-and-a-half hours from here, seven time zones away, with the warm water lapping at our feet, and with access to a seaside villa on pontoons, with Egyptian cotton sheets and a refreshing breeze. It is just a matter of holding on for a few more months – and parting with an extraordinary sum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2304" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kitchen11.jpg" alt="kitchen1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or perhaps we would be calm if the house could be as we really want it: with everything in its place, no more clutter, pristine walls, ample cupboards, stripped oak, limestone, recessed lighting and a bank of new appliances.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Or perhaps we will be calm when one day we reach the right place in the company, or the novel is sold, or the film is made or our shares are worth $5bn – and we can walk into a room of strangers and they will know at once.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2305" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144728761.jpg" alt="Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Rings Nasdaq Opening Bell" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or (and this one we keep a little more to ourselves), there might be calm if we had the right sort of person in our lives, someone who could properly understand us, a creature with whom it wouldn’t be so difficult, who would be kind and playfully sympathetic, who would have thoughtful, compassionate eyes and in whose arms we could lie in peace, almost like a child – though not quite.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4163" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500.jpg?resize=635%2C580" alt="tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Travel, Beauty, Status and Love: the four great contemporary ideals around which our fantasies of calm collect and which taken together are responsible for the lion’s share of the frenzied activities of the modern economy: its airports, long-haul jets and resort hotels; its overheated property markets, furniture companies and unscrupulous building contractors; its networking events, status-driven media and competitive business deals; its bewitching actors, soaring love songs and busy divorce lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet despite the promises and the passion expended in the pursuit of these goals, none of them will work. There will be anxiety at the beach, in the pristine home, after the sale of the company, and in the arms of anyone we will ever seduce, however often we try.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is our fundamental state for well-founded reasons:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we are intensely vulnerable physical beings, a complicated network of fragile organs all biding their time before eventually letting us down catastrophically at a moment of their own choosing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we have insufficient information upon which to make most major life decisions: we are steering more or less blind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we can imagine so much more than we have and live in mobile-driven, mediatised societies where envy and restlessness will be a constant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we are the descendants of the great worriers of the species, the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals, and because we still carry in our bones – into the calm of the suburbs – the terrors of the savannah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because visible objects and locations, oak tables and beaches, can only symbolise calm to our eyes rather than instil it in our psyches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because the progress of our careers and of our finances play themselves out within the tough-minded, competitive, destructive, random workings of an uncontained capitalist engine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we rely for our self-esteem and sense of comfort on the love of people we cannot control and whose needs and hopes will never align seamlessly with our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of which is not to say that there aren’t better and worse ways to approach our condition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single most important move is acceptance. There is no need – on top of everything else – to be anxious that we are anxious. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we are alive. We should be more careful when pursuing things we imagine will spare us anxiety. We can pursue them by all means, but for other reasons than fantasies of calm – and with a little less vigour and a little more scepticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should spare ourselves the burden of loneliness. We are far from the only ones with this problem. Everyone is more anxious than they are inclined to tell us. Even the tycoon and the couple in love are suffering. We’ve collectively failed to admit to ourselves what we are truly like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We must learn to laugh about our anxieties – laughter being the exuberant expression of relief when a hitherto private agony is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke. We can laugh about the terrors of having a body:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2307" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase64fbdf5d47a1f62f43.png" alt="pngbase64fbdf5d47a1f62f43" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And about the absurd scale of our ambitions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2308" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6437d174dce1ed1da7.png" alt="pngbase6437d174dce1ed1da7" data-recalc-dims="1" />And about how easily we lose perspective on everything:</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2309" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anti-cap-245-sailboat-wreck-tea-cup.jpg" alt="anti-cap-245-sailboat-wreck-tea-cup" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should hug; not the forced intimacy or oppressive bonhomie of most modern hugs, but the melancholy sympathetic way Botticelli’s angels do it, having come down to earth to offer comfort to humans for the brute facts of earthly existence:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4165" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5.png?resize=635%2C528" alt="pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We must suffer alone. But we can at least hold out our arms to our similarly tortured, fractured, and above all else, anxious neighbours, as if to say, in the kindest way possible: ‘I know…’</span></p>
