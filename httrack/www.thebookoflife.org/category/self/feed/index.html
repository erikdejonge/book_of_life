				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ancient Greece, the philosopher Socrates famously declared that the unexamined life was not worth living. Asked to sum up what all philosophical commandments could be reduced to, he replied: ‘Know yourself.’</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing yourself has extraordinary prestige in our culture. It has been framed as quite literally the meaning of life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9892" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg-1.jpg?resize=550%2C635" alt="Socrates_and_Alcibiades,_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sounds, when one hears it, highly plausible, yet so plausible it’s worth pausing to ask a few more questions. Just why is self-knowledge such a prestigious good? What are the dangers that come with a lack of self-knowledge? And what do we in fact need to know about ourselves? How do we come to learn such things? And why is self-knowledge difficult to attain?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we speak about self-knowledge, we’re alluding to a particular kind of knowledge &#8211; generally of an emotional or psychological kind. There are a million things you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> potentially know about yourself. Here are some options:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On what day of the week were you born?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Were you able to pick up a raisin between your fore-finger and thumb when you were five months old? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are you more an introvert or an extrovert?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How does your relationship with your father influence your career ambitions?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What kind of picnic person are you: morning or evening? River-bank, park or hill?</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9902" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k.jpg?resize=559%2C612" alt="14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us would recognise that questions 3 and 4 are ones worth knowing; the others, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, not everything that we can know about ourselves is all that important to find out. Here we want to focus on the areas of self-knowledge that matter most in life: the areas concerned with the inner psychological core of the self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key bits of self-knowledge we’ll be interested in are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what kind of person are you characteristically attracted to in love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what difficult patterns of behaviour are you prey to in relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what are your talents at work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what problems do you have around success/failure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- how are you about feedback</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what do you do when you have been frustrated by life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what kind of taste do you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- can you distinguish between your passing bodily-based emotions and your more rational thoughts</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8894271237_e995848419_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8894271237_e995848419_z.jpg?resize=427%2C640" alt="8894271237_e995848419_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have solid answers to these issues, you’ll be able to speak of yourself as someone with an adequate degree of self-knowledge.</span></p>
<p><b>ONE: WHY AND WHERE DOES SELF-KNOWLEDGE MATTER?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge is important for one central reason: because it offers us a route to greater happiness and fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of self-knowledge leaves you open to accident and mistaken ambitions.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with the right sort of self-knowledge, we have a greater chance of avoiding errors in our dealings with others and in the formulation of our life choices.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3171111654_f6d6a53495_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9906" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3171111654_f6d6a53495_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3171111654_f6d6a53495_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at some examples of areas where self-knowledge matters</span></p>
<p><strong>LOVE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, all sorts of problems may occur:</span></p>
<p><em>1. Choosing the wrong partner: We try to get together with people who don’t really suit us, because we don’t understand our needs</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When first looking out for a partner, the requirements we come up with are coloured often by a beautiful non-specific sentimental vagueness: we’ll say we really want to find someone who is ‘kind’ or ‘fun to be with’, ‘attractive’ or ‘up for adventure…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t that such desires are wrong, they are just not remotely precise enough in their understanding of what we in particular are going to require in order to stand a chance of being happy – or, more accurately, not consistently miserable.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4173018804_32c461c5d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9911" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4173018804_32c461c5d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4173018804_32c461c5d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of us are crazy in very particular ways. We’re distinctively neurotic, unbalanced and immature, but don’t know quite the details because no one ever encourages us too hard to find them out. An urgent, primary task of any lover is therefore to get a handle on the specific ways in which they are mad. They have to get up to speed on their individual neuroses. They have to grasp where these have come from, what they make them do – and most importantly, what sort of people either provoke or assuage them. A good partnership is not so much one between two healthy people (there aren’t many of these on the planet), it’s one between two demented people who have had the skill or luck to find a non-threatening conscious accommodation between their relative insanities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very idea that we might not be too difficult as people should set off alarm bells in any prospective partner. The question is just where the problems will lie: perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us, or we can only relax when we are working, or we’re a bit tricky around intimacy after sex, or we’ve never been so good at explaining what’s going on when we’re worried. It’s these sort of issues that – over decades – create catastrophes and that we therefore need to know about way ahead of time, in order to look out for people who are optimally designed to withstand them. A standard question on any early dinner date should be quite simply: ‘And how are you mad?’</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/285967033_1bb1bc0648_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9913" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/285967033_1bb1bc0648_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="285967033_1bb1bc0648_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that knowledge of our own neuroses is not at all easy to come by. It can take years and situations we have had no experience of. Prior to marriage, we’re rarely involved in dynamics that properly hold up a mirror to our disturbances. Whenever more casual relationships threaten to reveal the ‘difficult’ side of our natures, we tend to blame the partner – and call it a day. As for our friends, they predictably don’t care enough about us to have any motive to probe our real selves. They only want a nice evening out. Therefore, we end up blind to the awkward sides of our natures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our own, when we’re furious, we don’t shout, as there’s no one there to listen – and therefore we overlook the true, worrying strength of our capacity for fury. Or we work all the time without grasping, because there’s no one calling us to come for dinner, how we manically use work to gain a sense of control over life – and how we might cause hell if anyone tried to stop us. At night, all we’re aware of is how sweet it would be to cuddle with someone, but we have no opportunity to face up to the intimacy-avoiding side of us that would start to make us cold and strange if ever it felt we were too deeply committed to someone. One of the greatest privileges of being on one’s own is the flattering illusion that one is, in truth, really quite an easy person to live with. With such a poor level of understanding of our characters, no wonder we aren’t in any position to know who we should be looking out for.</span></p>
<p><em>2. We repeat unhealthy patterns from childhood, always latching on to people who will frustrate us in familiar but grievous ways</em></p>
<p>We believe we seek happiness in love, but it’s not quite that simple. What at times it seems we actually seek is familiarity – which may well complicate any plans we might have for happiness. We recreate in adult relationships some of the feelings we knew in childhood. It was as children that we first came to know and understand what love meant. But unfortunately, the lessons we picked up may not have been straightforward. The love we knew as children may have come entwined with other, less pleasant dynamics: being controlled, feeling humiliated, being abandoned, never communicating, in short: suffering. As adults, we may then reject certain healthy candidates whom we encounter, not because they are wrong, but precisely because they are too well-balanced (too mature, too understanding, too reliable), and this rightness feels unfamiliar and alien, almost oppressive. We head instead to candidates whom our unconscious is drawn to, not because they will please us, but because they will frustrate us in familiar ways. We get together with the wrong people because the right ones feel wrong – undeserved; because we have no experience of health, because we don’t ultimately associate being loved with feeling satisfied.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We fail to explain our feelings to our partners &#8211; because we don’t understand ourselves well enough. We act out our feelings rather than spell them out, often to destructive effect. (we break the door rather than explain we are mad with anger).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are unaware of the effects of our words on others. We don’t notice how often we say critical things to them or how often.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t anticipate and signpost our feelings: when we start to get over-excited and talk too fast, we should know it’s time to go for a walk round the block because otherwise there’s liable to be an explosion&#8230; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We project&#8217;, that is, we respond to events in the here and now according to patterns laid down in childhood; in our heads, our partners become mixed up with other people from our emotional history (a humiliating mother, a distant father etc…).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re governed by the past: old unfortunate habits keep their grip. We don’t see what’s happening and so we can’t do anything about it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9916" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot we can do once people are able to tell us what’s problematic about themselves. We don’t need people to be problem free &#8211; we need people to be able to explain where the problems are.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>WORK</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways in which a shortfall of self-knowledge is an obstacle to flourishing around work: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only have a few short years in which to come up with a convincing answer about what we want to do with our lives. Then, wherever we are in the thought-process, we have to jump into a job in order to have enough money to survive or appease society’s demands for our productivity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, we are too vague about our ambitions; we don’t know what to do with our lives and &#8211; because money tends to be such an urgent priority &#8211; we lock ourselves into a cage from which it may take decades to emerge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are too modest: we miss out on opportunities: we don’t know what we are capable of.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are too ambitious: we don’t know what we shouldn’t attempt. We lack a clear sense of our limitations, wasting years trying to do something we’re not suited to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t grasp the ways in which we are difficult employees or bosses. We might &#8211; among other problems &#8211; be crazily defensive, or resistant to trusting anyone or too eager to please.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t perceive our hidden attitudes to success and failure. It may be that we see ourselves (wrongly) as not cut out for the bigger roles or when things start to go well, we become manically prone to make a blunder. Perhaps we’re unconsciously trying to avoid rivalry with a parent, or a sibling by tripping ourselves up. Family dynamics have an enormous, subterranean influence on how effectively we operate at work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIVING WITH OTHERS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, we are, in general, a liability to be around:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t realise the effect we tend to have on other people: without at all meaning to, we might come across as arrogant or cold, or as tending to hog attention or as needlessly shy and hesitant or as getting furious in dangerous ways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may fall prey to unnecessary loneliness: not understanding what we really need and what makes us hard to get to know.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties of empathy: not acknowledging the more vulnerable or disturbed parts of oneself; means not seeing oneself as being ‘like’ other people in crucial ways. It’s hard to understand the deeper bits of others without having explored oneself first.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6252253136_8896c836f1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9920" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6252253136_8896c836f1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6252253136_8896c836f1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SPENDING MONEY UNWISELY </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of what we spend money on is a hunch about what will make us happy. But without self-knowledge, we’ll have a hard time figuring out the relationship between what we purchase and how we feel.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays and travels will leave us disappointed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impulsive purchases will soon be regretted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll be prey to fashion: not knowing ourselves, we’ll be at the mercy of what consumer society tells us to want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might become inadvertent snobs: liking things because others like them rather than for deeper personal reasons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Self-knowledge has always been important. But now it’s more so than ever. This is a result of political and social progress. When life was much more constrained by tradition, rigid social hierarchy and rigorous codes of manners, there was less need for self-knowledge to guide action. Now, if we are to exploit the independence and freedom we’ve been offered (in love, work and social lives), there is all the more reason to get to know ourselves in good time.</p>
<p><b>TWO: WHY IS SELF-KNOWLEDGE SO HARD TO COME BY?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pay a high price for lack of self-knowledge. So why is it in short supply? Why is it hard for us to know ourselves in these ways? It’s not laziness or stupidity that explains it. There are several huge cognitive frailties that make it hard for us to have certain kinds of insight about ourselves. There are six reasons why self-knowledge is tricky for creatures with the kinds of minds we have.</span></p>
<p><strong>One: The Unconscious</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human beings have evolved into creatures whose minds are divided into conscious and unconscious processes. Digesting lunch is unconscious; reflecting on what you’d like to do this weekend is conscious.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12120008_430a33f548_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9923" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12120008_430a33f548_o.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="12120008_430a33f548_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this division is bandwidth. We simply couldn’t cope if everything we did had to be filtered through the conscious mind.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we start off as children with fierce difficulties around self-awareness. Nature has structured us so that self-awareness comes very late on: you only have to study how children are to know that an awareness of self is a very late evolution of character.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4641589419_3d5c41d860_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9927" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4641589419_3d5c41d860_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4641589419_3d5c41d860_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, we can argue that we suffer because a little too much of how we behave happens unconsciously &#8211; when we would benefit from a closer grasp on what was going on. The default balance between conscious and unconscious tends to be wrong, we are incentivised to let too much of who we are happen in the unconscious.</span></p>
<p>As a general point, we need to make heroic efforts to correct the imbalance and bring more of our lives into the conscious realm.</p>
<p><strong>Two: The Emotional and the Rational Mind</strong></p>
<p>A traditional way of conceiving of our minds is that there’s a small rational bit and a far larger, more dominant emotional bit.</p>
<p>Plato compared the rational bit to a group of wild horses dragging the conscious mind along.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20845692109_a7965fc16c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9929" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20845692109_a7965fc16c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="20845692109_a7965fc16c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, neuroscientists tell us about three parts of the brain:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the reptilian</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the limbic </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and the neocortex</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reptilian is, as the name sounds, the earliest and the most primitive. It’s interested in basic survival and responds immediately, in knee-jerk ways, unconsciously and rather aggressively and destructively. It’s what’s engaged if a lion surprises you in the jungle.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6947070424_36a7375aa8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9931" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6947070424_36a7375aa8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="6947070424_36a7375aa8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limbic part of the brain, a later development is concerned with emotions and memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neocortex, a very late development, is where our higher reasoning faculties lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t have to buy into the precise terminology here to understand the drift: a lot of our lives is dominated by automatic, over-emotional, distorting responses by the ‘lower’ parts of the mind; and only occasionally can we hope to gain rational perspective through our higher faculties.</span></p>
<p><strong>Three: Freudian Resistance</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it isn’t just the case that things are unconscious by accident. It was Sigmund Freud’s great insight that they remain unconscious because of a squeamishness on our part: there is &#8211; in his term &#8211; extraordinary ‘resistance’ to making a lot of our unconscious material conscious.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unconscious contains desires and feelings that deeply challenge a more comfortable vision of ourselves. We might discover &#8211; if we got to know ourselves better &#8211; that we’re attracted to a different gender, or have career ambitions quite different from those our society expects of us. We therefore ‘resist’ finding out too much about ourselves in many areas. It shatters the short-term peace we’re addicted to.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4164759025_da547a9341_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9933" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4164759025_da547a9341_z.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="4164759025_da547a9341_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, of course, for Freud, we pay a high price for this. Short-term peace is unstable, it is, to use another word of his, ‘neurotic’, and cuts us off from the benefits of long-term honesty about aspects of our identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too often we say of thoughts, it’s ‘safer not to go there’. One simply pushes feelings and ideas aside. Resistance means we are escaping the humiliation of admitting to particular appetites and desires &#8211; especially when these are at odds with what we’d like to be like or how others want us to be. We reduce our immediate suffering. But the cost is that we can’t properly aim for what would truly make us happy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: Other people won’t tell us</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many aspects of our identities that it is simply hard for us to see without the help of another person. We need others to be our mirrors, feeding back their insights and perspectives on the elusive, hard-to-see parts of ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, getting hold of data from others is a very unreliable process. Very few people can be bothered to undertake the arduous task of giving us feedback.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5532251255_e655e70829_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9937" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5532251255_e655e70829_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="5532251255_e655e70829_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either they dislike us too much and therefore can’t be bothered. Or they like us too much, and don’t want to upset us.</span></p>
<p>Our friends are too polite; good intentions lead them to keep their less pleasant observations to themselves. Our enemies have so much to tell us: it’s not always the people we like who see certain aspects of us most clearly. It might be someone we’re at loggerheads with who has the sharpest sense of what’s not quite going right in our character (a way, for instance, of letting people down after a long period of seeming to go along with their plans; a very annoying habit of sitting on the fence). But they are not likely to be good at sharing their wisdom with us. They either won’t take the trouble, or will brush us off with the sort of sharp insults that will make us defensive and closed to the wiser aspects embedded within their harsh assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Five: We haven’t lived enough</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many bits of self-knowledge only come through experience. Think of ourselves as being like a biscuit mould: it’s only by pressing ourselves against the dough of life that we get to see what shape we actually are.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8041914781_d2deb1560b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9939" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8041914781_d2deb1560b_b.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="8041914781_d2deb1560b_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge therefore isn’t something we can always do in isolation, retreating from the world to look into ourselves.</span></p>
<p>We acquire knowledge dynamically, by trying things out and colliding with others &#8211; which always carries a risk, and takes time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In careers, for example, we can’t know what we might want to do with our lives simply by asking ourselves this question. We need to head out into the workplace and try things out. We need to spend a week at an architect’s office, or go and meet someone in the diplomatic service etc.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5015628145_70684eaae0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9942" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5015628145_70684eaae0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="5015628145_70684eaae0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge can only evolved as a result of dialogue with the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Six: We are fatefully vague about stuff</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our thoughts about many things are marked first and foremost by vagueness. Our intellectual muscles are &#8211; by nature &#8211; rather weak. Our initial reactions to things are frequently of the order of ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’. We have pronounced pro or contra feelings towards something but struggle to say more. We say things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to be creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loathe big business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m feeling out of sorts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He annoys me</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These reports might be true, but they are not very high-quality items in terms of self- knowledge. They’re not accurate enough to help guide action. It’s not that they are wrong, the problem is they are too vague. They don’t get to grips with what is really the issue. They circle in the big, general territory but don’t land anywhere specific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a personal problem. It’s universal. The first reports from our conscious minds are just by nature horribly vague &#8211; and in need of sustained analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Seven: Introspection is low on prestige and unfamiliar</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introspection is the name we give to the close study of one’s feelings and ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17444642555_fa91a08408_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9944" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17444642555_fa91a08408_z.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="17444642555_fa91a08408_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, it isn’t given high prestige in our society. We’re rarely encouraged to unpack our thoughts. The notion of what it means to have a conversation with a friend rarely includes trying to make progress in sorting out feelings. Psychotherapy &#8211; the prime arena for analysing oneself &#8211; interests barely 1% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of increasing the self-knowledge of a society is to help make the idea of introspection a little more glamorous; it should be thought of as a very plausible concept to spend a weekend on or host a dinner party around.</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: HOW TO GET MORE SELF-KNOWLEDGE &#8211; AND IN WHAT AREAS</b></p>
<p><b>ONE: &#8211; RELATIONSHIPS</b></p>
<p><b>i: Repetition Compulsion</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not terribly flexible when it comes to falling in love. We have types. There are patterns: each of us tends to have a characteristic sort of person we go for &#8211; a more or less sketchy template of the sort of person we find very attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The template is highly individual, but if we could open up people’s heads we might find things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the <em>B</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yronic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> type &#8211; dark hair (frequently tousled), reserved but intense; naughty</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9948" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5999173176_e863594e0d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">serene type &#8211; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">calm, unruffled, angst-free</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9946" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C318" alt="6472122961_c6477930d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cheeky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> type &#8211; bouncy, unpretentious, free  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9949" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5991451389_05c65484eb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We’re used to seeing our types in terms of the positives. But, in fact, every type also carries a lot of negatives as well. The people we tend to go for may be attractive to us not only for some very nice reasons but also because they bring with them some special kind of trouble or difficulty to which we are especially prone. Most of us are involved in the compulsion to repeat kinds of suffering in our personal lives, normally based on a suffering in early childhood.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting the same templates in darker terms, it might turn out that someone is drawn to:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9948" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5999173176_e863594e0d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a chaotic, selfish, volcanic person who seems always to be on the verge of losing their temper and is never on time (Byronic)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9946" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C318" alt="6472122961_c6477930d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who will be wrapped up in themselves and slightly depressed (serene)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9949" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5991451389_05c65484eb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an infantile person with poor self-management skills who needs a lot of looking after (cheeky)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We need self-knowledge in love because were so prone to repeat unhealthy patterns. We leave a relationship hoping to leave behind a particular set of problems &#8211; which we find again in the next relationship. These patterns normally derive from childhood experience whereby love was mixed in with various kinds of suffering. The father whose attention and affection we craved was also often annoyed (annoyance, ever since, has proved desperately interesting to a part of us); the mother who we loved was often preoccupied and always heading out to do more exciting things while leaving us behind (our partner is in a high stress job and doesn’t often call&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when we’re searching for affection and closeness we look out for some quite negative, even damaging things, since we have learned to think that this is how love works. We don’t notice it, so the pattern keeps on guiding our behaviour in unfortunate ways. The psychoanalytic theory of </span><b>repetition compulsion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means that you’re also being drawn to something problematic. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are rather bossy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are critical</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are in some way rather inadequate and in need of help</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are agitated and irritable</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means first of all </span><b><i>seeing</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the pattern. It means understanding the negative aspects of the type of person we tend to get involved with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culturally we are resistant to this kind of self-knowledge. We’re not used to the notion that we might be drawn to people for bad reasons. We want to say: I hate it when people don’t listen or I really don’t like irritable and agitated individuals. And of course that is true. We don’t like it when people behave these ways.</span></p>
<p><b>But we do much too often end up with them!</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>– Think of a celebrity or actor that you find attractive.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6998770173_1ec427ce93_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9953" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6998770173_1ec427ce93_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6998770173_1ec427ce93_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are some good things you find attractive about them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What might be the bad reasons you are drawn to them? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are the difficult sides of people you’re oddly rather drawn to? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sketch a ‘type’ you find attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are the bad reasons you find this type attractive? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What have the consequences been in your life?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Gaining self-knowledge about the darker aspects of one’s own pattern of attraction allows us to be more strategic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking for a new relationship:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realise that emotional appeal is not necessarily &#8211; for us &#8211; the best guide to who we could have good relationship with.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick up at a much earlier stage that one might be making this mistake and recognising that it is a mistake.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6946571627_eab30ba24a_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9955" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6946571627_eab30ba24a_k.jpg?resize=635%2C341" alt="6946571627_eab30ba24a_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a long-standing relationship: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept that we shouldn’t simply blame the other person for certain annoying characteristics &#8211; such as their distance or irritability. We can admit that this was part of what drew us to them in the first place.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps identify the kind of compensating maturity one needs; if you are drawn to quite critical people, you can’t always then blame them for being critical.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ii: PROJECTION </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our minds have a strong natural tendency to PROJECTION, that is, to elaborate a response to a current situation from incomplete hints &#8211; drawing upon a dynamic set up in our past and indicative of our unconscious interests, drives and concerns.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at this image, which appears as part of a famous PROJECTION TEST:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Projection-Image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9957" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Projection-Image.jpg?resize=550%2C650" alt="Projection-Image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you ask, what’s going on here, we all could read different things into the image. People might say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we do know &#8211; really &#8211; is that the picture doesn’t really show any of these things. It is an AMBIGUOUS image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The picture simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. </span><b>The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. </span><b>This is projection.</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t just do this around images; the same thing happens with people. In relationships, projection kicks in when there are ‘ambiguous situations’.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, your partner is quietly chuckling at a text message. They don’t offer to share it with you. They quickly send a reply. You start to feel very agitated. It looks like your partner is having an affair. They have just received a message from their lover reminding them of some very intimate joke (which might even be about you and your failings); you partner eagerly responds. They don’t love you. You are abandoned, betrayed. You are now very angry with you partner; you feel victimised. But actually, nothing like this is really going on at all. The message was from an over-conscientious colleague at work, and your partner found it comic they should be bothering about such trivia and didn’t think it was even worth mentioning. In fact, the distress you felt derived from when you were at school: you discovered that the person you thought was your best friend was actually saying mean things about to others. You are still wounded by this, though you hate to admit it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3158139232_68f84029ec_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9962" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3158139232_68f84029ec_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3158139232_68f84029ec_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure is </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We observe something but in honest truth it’s not entirely clear what it means. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We read into the situation a set of motive, intentions, attitudes &#8211; which are usually distressing to us and give rise to anxiety and anger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anxiety or fear actually relate to an earlier experience. But we don’t realise this. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are frightened by, or angry about, what’s happening now. Even though really we shouldn’t be.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projection is always about telling ourselves a story in answer to the question: what did</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really mean? That might be, for instance, be a situation as well as a person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are projecting it doesn’t FEEL as if we are doing anything complicated or special. On the contrary it feels just as if we are seeing things as they are. So, typically we dislike the suggestion that we are ‘projecting’. It feels as if it is an insult to our ability to perceive how things really are. Admitting the possibility that one might be projecting is humbling. But it could be worth it because projection brings a lot of trouble into our lives. We’re venting our anger on the wrong individual. And maybe in the process hurting someone very unfairly. We are afraid of the wrong person. Our fear of someone in the past gets in the way of making a friend or ally of someone today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means recognising one’s projections and attempting to repatriate. The active issue isn’t here and now: it’s some unfinished business from the past that’s still bugging us. </span></p>
<p><b>EXERCISE </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– In the images below what do you think is going on? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Say (without thinking too much) what you believe is happening. Write it down on a piece of paper, while others do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then, as a class, go around and compare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then ask yourselves what your possible explanation says not about the picture &#8211; it’s ambiguous &#8211; but about you. What parts of you have ‘projected’ into the ambiguous image?</span></p>

<p><b>TWO: &#8211; CONFRONTATION AND CRITICISM</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area where a lack of self-knowledge bites is around how we characteristically behave with others, friends, family and colleagues. There are a number of themes here.</span></p>
<p><strong>i: Confrontation Styles </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily life offers us constant frustrations where we have a choice as to how we might respond. All of us exhibit a variety of ‘confrontation styles’, but we’re often unaware which kind we generally go in for &#8211; and what the costs and consequences are.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Someone promised you a document by midday. It’s now 1pm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It’s your birthday next week, but your partner hasn’t said anything about it. You’d ideally love to go out.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9965" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- There’s a drilling sound coming from next door &#8211; again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-  A work colleague has been muscling in on one of your clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you feel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how would you typically react?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 4 key varieties of possible responses: passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive or assertive:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Passive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you feel it’s just how life goes, some things you have to accept; if you make a fuss, it just makes everything worse. After all, it’s not that bad really. Sometimes you really resent these things, but you make yourself put up with them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Aggressive:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m bloody annoyed. Where is that document? Why hasn’t my partner mentioned a party? Why should I suffer because the neighbours are incompetent, stupid, greedy or too lazy to do their DIY at some reasonable hour? If they don’t get their act together you’re really going to show them who’s boss. They can shape up or ship out as far as you are concerned.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Passive-aggressive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A curious toxic mixture of passivity and more aggressive feelings. One tells oneself things like: ‘I don’t make a big fuss about my birthday &#8211; and of course my partner has a lot on their plate always.’ But secretly one is fuming. Or one thinks, ‘X is a perennially unreliable fool,’ but when their document eventually comes in at 5pm, one says, ‘Great to get this!!’ and leaves it at that… There’s a lot of hostility around but it is indirect. The passive aggressive person keeps their anger veiled just enough so as to be able to deny it to others and to themselves. They don’t feel they are being negative or aggressive. They see themselves as hard done by. What they hate most of all is to make a fuss &#8211; but that doesn’t prevent them being very upset. Often, the upset which hasn’t emerged with the person who caused it will later find a way out with a more innocent party. Passive aggressive people who didn’t make their feelings clear in the office will, when they get home, frequently take it out on the kids, the partner or the dog. Passive-aggression has its roots in low self-esteem. One simply doesn’t feel one is allowed to make a direct critique. Direct criticism takes confidence. At the same time, one can’t be happy either. Therefore, the compromise is a veiled compromise attack.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Assertive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you are clear about when someone has behaved badly towards you or is causing a problem. You aren’t happy about it. But your main aim is to fix the problem. You don’t need to take revenge or try to get the other person to feel guilty. You can go up to them and confidently make your point. You aren’t ashamed of yourself or guilty for making a fuss. You think it’s normal to treat people well &#8211; you do &#8211; and if someone else falls below your standards, you’re not embarrassed to tell them so in plain terms. It won’t be a catastrophe, just a few unpleasant moments, but that will allow the relationship to improve over the long-term. No festering wounds here.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few of us are assertive. One estimate is that no more than 20% of the population manage to be direct in a mature way about their ailments. That means there’s a lot of subterranean anger, a lot of people who are being shouted at even though they aren’t really responsible.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/587483238_3ed5b750e9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9967" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/587483238_3ed5b750e9_b.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="587483238_3ed5b750e9_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why passive-aggression is something we’re not aware of doing &#8211; and therefore need to increase our self-knowledge around &#8211; is that there are lots of inhibitions to being ‘straight’ around things one’s annoyed about:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might feel one doesn’t deserve to make a fuss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might have a sense of shame/inner conviction of being bad which prevents one from taking the high ground ever, even when one deserves to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might feel that other people will respond volcanically and catastrophically if one makes any complaint against them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These assumptions are all worth questioning.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is from something called the Ascendance-Submission study by the American psychologist Gordon Allport:</span></p>
<p>1. Someone tries to push ahead of you in line. You have been waiting for some time, and can&#8217;t wait much longer. Suppose the intruder is the same sex as yourself, do you usually:</p>
<p>– remonstrate with the intrude</p>
<p>– &#8216;look daggers&#8217; at the intruder or make clearly audible comments to your neighbour</p>
<p>– decide not to wait and go away</p>
<p>– do nothing</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9974" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C346" alt="18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>2. Do you feel self-conscious in the presence of superiors in the academic or business world?</p>
<p>– markedly</p>
<p>– somewhat</p>
<p>– not at all</p>
<p>3. Some possession of yours is being worked upon at a repair shop. You call for it at the time appointed, but the repair man informs you that he has &#8220;only just begun to work on it.&#8221; Is your customary reaction:</p>
<p>– to upbraid him</p>
<p>– to express dissatisfaction mildly</p>
<p>– to smother your feelings entirely</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another American psychologist, Dr Saul Rosenzweig, came up with the Picture Frustration test, which shows a number of frustrating situations and invites us to fill in the blanks:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9969" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500.png?resize=454%2C579" alt="tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might you respond to this scenario? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try this out + discuss what other moments in life you respond in similar ways&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Criticism</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticism is always challenging,  but people respond to it in a variety ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be hugely beneficial to get a better grip on your characteristic response/behaviour around criticism &#8211; in order to be able to modulate it, and advance towards the more mature varieties.</span></p>
<p><strong>Possible Responses to Criticism</strong></p>
<p>1. They must be entirely wrong:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the response colloquially known as ‘defensive’ &#8211; whereby a criticism unleashes a disproportionately strong defence against it. The original criticism isn’t heard, for its destinee is so taken up with shoring up their position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thinks: &#8220;I am OK, I don’t generally make mistakes. If they are annoyed with me, it’s likely that they are being too demanding, or they’re jealous, or they’re trying to kick me down. The problem is theirs.&#8221;</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>2. They must be entirely right and I don’t deserve to exist:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here one thinks that a local criticism (of a book, a document, something one said over dinner) is in fact pointing to a global problem. Very quickly, the local criticism brings about a crisis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t deserve to exist. I am a wretch. They have seen through the facade. It is true, I am meaningless, petty, stupid and dull&#8230;’</span></p>
<p>3. They might be right AND I can be OK</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here one is able to contain the criticism to the issue at hand. One is able to distinguish between a criticism of some aspect of oneself and a wholehearted assault on one’s identity. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15836610049_033b782406_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9977" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15836610049_033b782406_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15836610049_033b782406_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular forms of self-knowledge exercises among psychologists involve an invitation to finish sentence stubs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is to answer fast, without thinking too much, thereby allowing the unconscious mind to have its say before it is censored.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some sentence stubs to complete around the issue of criticism:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When someone points out a piece of work of mine is less than perfect, I…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When my boss says something to me, I think…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Bosses who criticise typically&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to work out your Criticism style:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– are you defensive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– or do you feel globally attacked</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– or locally attacked?</span></p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s response to criticism is formed in childhood.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the task of all parents to criticise their children and break bad news to them about their wishes and plans &#8211; but there are evidently different ways of going about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best sort of criticism leaves a child feeling that the criticism is local &#8211; but that they remain loved and adored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the suggestion is that everyone makes mistakes, especially the parents, and that criticism is a well-meaning and in no way threatening aspect of daily life.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5308268074_0936a164b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9980" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5308268074_0936a164b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="5308268074_0936a164b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are also scenarios where the child is criticised and no one notices that the criticism cuts too deep. There is no suggestion that this is ONLY a limited criticism. The child falls prey to the belief that they are entirely worthless. Throughout adulthood, the slightest critique can re-evoke this perspective.</span></p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did you learn about criticism in your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did your mother/father make you feel when they criticised you?</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: &#8211; CAREER</b></p>
<p><strong>i: Vagueness around one’s ambitions</strong></p>
<p>When thinking about aspirations, hopes and what it would be good to do, there’s a very strong tendency to end up saying things like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to help other people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to be creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to do something that matters</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22568358497_7e0de42273_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9983" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22568358497_7e0de42273_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="22568358497_7e0de42273_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statements might be very true and the sentiments admirable. The problem with them is that they are vague. They don’t point in any particular direction: they don’t guide action or do much to help make a decision. Vagueness is a sign of the difficulty we have around self-knowledge. It shows that in some important aspect of life we don’t yet know ourselves very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we improve self-knowledge around ambitions? </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>1. Dare to name some people you envy and or admire &#8211; however grand and implausible. One of the causes of vagueness is that (after the age of about eleven) we feel embarrassed to mention very high status individuals as inspiration; we sense that we’ll be seen as pretentious or naive. But it’s important to list them because they are the grandest version of the person you want to be. It could be Michelangelo or Lady Gaga or Goethe or Bill Gates. The point isn’t that you necessarily want to be them or just like them. It’s that there is something about them that you want to learn from.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9985" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>2. Moving from person to trait. Analyse what it is about them that you admire…</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needn’t be the thing they are most famous for. The cause of vagueness here is that we get hung up on people. We focus on the person &#8211; and there are so many different things about them that are impressive. So simply naming them leaves it vague what it is we’re trying to learn from this person’s example. </span></p>
<p>3. How could that quality be more present in your life…</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cause of vagueness is inflexibility. We can see how that quality played itself out in that person’s life. But what we really want to know is what else can be done with it. The person we’re thinking about is only giving a hint.  </span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Attitudes to ambition</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many </span><b>obstacles to doing well at work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, getting the kind of partner we feel we deserve; or getting on top of our financial and creative lives: competition from able rivals, not enough room at the top, prejudice, limited talents. But some of the most serious barriers to success come from within our own heads. We suffer from problematic attitudes to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are held back by anxiety around success. These anxieties mean that we are not purely seeking to succeed. Without realising it, we are also quite invested in aspects of failure.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success makes you envied. They’ll think I’m showing off, big-noting myself. I really don’t want to be the target of other people’s envy. Better to remain on the sidelines. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inner feudalism: there are sorts of people who are allowed to succeed and do big things in the world; unfortunately, I’m not one of them; things like that just don’t happen to people like me.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3240991428_4691b3a4bc_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9987" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3240991428_4691b3a4bc_o.jpg?resize=635%2C373" alt="cyberuly@yahoo.it" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the danger of over-investment in the idea of ‘success’. It’s natural to want to do well-enough around work. But career can be a magnet for other hopes that don’t really belong in this area. One comes to believe that if only things go well in terms of career or money, many other problems will be solved too. It’s a line of thought that is strongly encouraged by contemporary society. Meritocratic attitudes invite the misleading thought that how you do at work is a measure of your global worth; advertising relentlessly projects the thought that psychological qualities like friendship, good relationships, serenity and a sense of fun are tied to financial prosperity (and hence to career success). These kinds of thoughts are not explicitly running through our heads but reflection on our behaviour may indicate that we act as if we believe such things as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I succeed at work, I will deserve to be loved. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will stop feeling lonely when I’ve made it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday will be great &#8211; if only we stay in luxury.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High status means happiness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15037815133_5a787fca61_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9990" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15037815133_5a787fca61_z.jpg?resize=635%2C507" alt="15037815133_5a787fca61_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once such beliefs have been made explicit they can be put to the test. For instance: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other people can succeed, but not me.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is it true? Examine it like a statement in court. What evidence supports this? What are all the things that could be said in its favour and assess their plausibility.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some people are born lucky &#8211; this can’t be right.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talent is unequally distributed &#8211; true, but many of the people who you think are successful are not more talented than you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are prejudices which favour some and disadvantage others &#8211; yes, but (usually) only to some extent, they are not decisive</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If I succeed, what will happen is… (both negative and positive)  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– By succeeding, I’d love to please…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The person who might (secretly) be most dismayed by my success would be…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– People who are successful are typically…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I wouldn’t want to be a success because..</span></p>
<p><strong>iii: The meaning of your life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of daily life, impressed by the expectations of other people and bombarded with ideas from the media and advertising (which are unlikely to have one’s own best interest at heart), it’s completely unsurprising that we get confused about how much something really matters to us. </span></p>
<p><b>EXERCISE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were on your deathbed, what would you regret not doing…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exercise is designed to tease out underlying ambitions that you are reluctant to explore. They might seem too challenging or embarrassing to admit to anyone else. The point isn’t necessarily to explain them to others but to give them more attention in the privacy of your own head. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, in fact, do you hold back from doing these things?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might those obstacles be addressed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What specific practical steps you could take?</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death-bed exercise also helps reveal the true hierarchy of our needs.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things that have only a very limited contribution to make to our flourishing come to seem much more important than the really are.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We underrate the importance of things that are familiar or maybe not especially exciting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>FOUR: &#8211; </b><b>WHAT OTHERS CAN KNOW OF US (AT ONCE)</b></p>
<p>When it comes to other people, we are all a bit like mind-readers. Mind-readers astonish their customers by telling them things about their lives &#8211; you have had a quarrel with your parents recently; you were close to a sibling when you were a child, but in recent years you have drifted apart and that makes you sad. And the visitor is left wondering: how did they know this about me. It must be magic. They can sometimes tell us after a minute things that it’s taken us years to find out about ourselves. They might note that we react defensively when mentioning our parents &#8211; as if we feel we are about to be accused of something; though this characteristic is one we are reluctant to recognise in ourselves. Mind-reading just shows up that knowledge about us is surprisingly obvious and easy for an outsider to get hold of &#8211; much easier than for us inside. Strangers are surprisingly good at guessing things about us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One consequence is that we find it difficult to grasp how other people see us. The gap between self-perception and the point of view of others is richly comic: pomposity for example occurs when someone can’t see that other people don’t share their high opinion of their own merits; and there’s a satisfaction in seeing this person being forced by events to a much lower and more accurate picture of themselves. But mostly, of course, it doesn’t seem especially funny: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t realise</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that you are taxing other people’s patience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other people often feel you hog the limelight</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you come across as arrogant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you seem excessively diffident</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are often trying to hint that you have done everything anyone else has done; as if it would be painful to you to be impressed by anyone</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2163760529_914e576884_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9998" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2163760529_914e576884_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C459" alt="2163760529_914e576884_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point isn’t that other people are always right. The point isn’t that one should feel cross with other people for not rightly appreciating one’s better intent. (‘Of course, I didn’t mean to be arrogant? Can’t they tell the difference between honest assertion and showing off?’)  It’s just that it is really helpful to know how we impact on other people since this allows for strategic adjustment. Once we know we can try to change for the sake of getting on better with others &#8211; being a little less assertive at certain points or making an effort to ask other people questions about themselves.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair up with someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get them to say 5 nice things about this person, based on very little knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, one negative thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did they know this negative thing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap roles. </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Write down the kind of animal you might see yourself as being. And list three attributes that you feel you share to some extent with this kind of creature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then ask another person to draw the animal they see you as being, and to pick out three characteristics that help explain why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What do you learn from their choice and their reasons?</span></p>
<p><b>FIVE: &#8211; FAMILY DYNAMICS</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>i: Overall Picture: How you feel about your family</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you really feel about your family? Especially the things that you don’t say for all sorts of reasons: you might hurt particular people; you feel guilty because, after all they have been very good to you in some ways; you feel disloyal; you fear that people will feel sorry for you in ways that make you awkward; you fear that people will regard you with contempt. Such thoughts are likely to remain shadowy. We have unconscious &#8211; or barely unconscious attitudes in relation to family that are liable to play serious havoc with our lives. Possibilities include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attitudes to a younger brother are governing one’s feelings about never having enough.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings about an older sister have led to problems around envy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general tendency to be deferential around authority might be traced to an excessive need to please one’s parents.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21756049429_d12330162a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10002" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21756049429_d12330162a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="21756049429_d12330162a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key psychological exercise is to draw your nuclear family; putting in parents + siblings + house + a sun + a tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then examine the drawing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draw your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask: Who is big?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is small?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is everyone standing?</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2068811986_a2d5a76167_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10004" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2068811986_a2d5a76167_z.jpg?resize=635%2C513" alt="2068811986_a2d5a76167_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some typical themes in analysis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- who you draw yourself next to is who you are closest to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- who are you are most distant from is put faraway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the size you have drawn yourself is the size of your self-esteem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the house is an extension of yourself: it is the ego. Is it in good shape? Optimistic? Ordered?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows imply a degree of communication/passage. Does it have a door?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is only a start, and it’s not science &#8211; but the exercise is useful nevertheless, trying &#8211; like the sentence stubb exercise &#8211; to catch our unconscious slightly unawares in order to reveal its structure.</span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Blame and self-knowledge:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may not be aware of the extent to which we assign problems in our lives to our parents. </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>1. What do you blame your parents for?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we are looking for an ego response: how they hurt me, the mistakes they made etc.</span></p>
<p>2.<b> </b>Why do you think they were the way they were?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very different sort of question. It asks you to step outside of yourself and ask not, how did they hurt me or disappoint me &#8211; but rather, what were the pressures and difficulties they were under. It interrupts the circuit of hurt-blame, replacing it with hurt-understanding.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4739023417_679e49c25f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10031" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4739023417_679e49c25f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Father Holding Daughter's Hand" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blaming one’s parents isn’t &#8211; of course &#8211; always a mistake. It’s just that doing so can get in the way of a better understanding of the nature of a problem. And hence of what it is possible to do about it.</span></p>
<p><b>SIX: &#8211; TASTE AND YOUR IDEA OF HAPPINESS</b></p>
<p>We aren’t used to the idea that interior decoration can tell us anything very intimate about ourselves. But aesthetic preferences can yield revealing insights. That’s because personal taste reflects other things about us.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may be disturbed by unfortunate associations to certain kinds of objects or environments. At a particular age you might have seen a film in which a character who deeply appealed to you, lived in rather grand classical mansion; ever since then you’ve had quiet &#8211; but quite strong &#8211; positive feelings about such places. Understanding the attraction leads back to the prior question: what it was about that character that you found so appealing? Or it may be that a rather fearsome relative was very critical of mess, which touched off a rebellious opposite in you; you find a bit of clutter and a confusion of colours homely and endearing (which that person definitely was not). Analysing the response helps uncover the further concerns &#8211; the loves, antipathies, hopes and fears &#8211; that helped to shape your taste.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are drawn to things we don’t have enough of. Aesthetic preference is often connected to the pursuit of balance. If we are typically stressed and anxious, we might be very attracted to serene environments. A person who has been assailed too often by boorish people, might be very attracted to things that suggest refinement, order and harmony: the lack of which has been painfully brought home to them.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We find neglected parts of ourselves in objects: in daily life we may give little attention or respect to aspects of our own nature that &#8211; however &#8211; hint at their existence in our tastes. The thrilled response to a grand interior in another wise demure individual suggest a bolder, more ambitious side to them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider these different interiors:</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">minimalist</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which one do you hate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which one are you drawn to?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underlying theory is that we are drawn to visual styles which capture what is MISSING in our psyches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the person attracted to calm-minimalism doesn’t feel calm inside. They feel on the verge of being overwhelmed &#8211; and look to a taste that can CORRECT their inclinations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly with the bohemian style &#8211; this is favoured not by bohemians, but by people deeply frightened of their native impulses towards conformity and rigidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use visual decoration styles to correct/rebalance ourselves.</span></p>
<p><b>SEVEN: &#8211; </b><b>Wisdom and the search for moments of Higher Consciousness</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, self-knowledge is concerned with describing more accurately how one feels. It follows the path of introspection. You try work out what you actually feel when you look at the sky or watch a film or feel bored in a meeting.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21141215321_880450686e_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10019" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21141215321_880450686e_k.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="21141215321_880450686e_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another side to self-knowledge: becoming more aware of how the self-machine works: of how your mind operates and distorts things. For instance, you learn that eating a lot of chocolate makes you feel a bit queasy afterwards. Eating chocolate doesn’t feel as if it will do that. It’s so delicious you can’t resist another square. But gradually you just learn that this is how your particular machine work: if you put in a lot of chocolate it starts to create problems. Just as we can learn how the body works, we can also learn how the mind works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major implication of evolutionary theory is that the human brain itself has evolved over a very long period of time. The body, we readily accept, carries many indications of its long, long developmental story. The kind of eyes we have, the way our knees work or how our lungs extract oxygen from the air are not unique to humans. These kinds of organs and joints evolved long before humans were around.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So too with our brains. Hence the usefulness of talking about a ‘</span><b>reptilian’ </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of the brain, even though it isn’t absolutely correct scientifically (we don’t literally have the brain of lizard encased within our skulls). We have instincts and response patterns that evolved to suit being chased by predators or needing mate no matter what, that are more suited to existence in the pleistocene era than to life in a modern metropolis (or rural farming community).</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reptilian brain is interested only in survival and responds instinctively and fast. It is out for itself, it has no capacity for empathy or morality. It is deeply and constitutionally selfish.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we also have a more evolved mature brain (scientists call it the </span><b>neocortex</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) which is able to gain a distance from immediate reptilian demands. It can observe rather than submit to the sexual impulse: it can study, rather than obey, selfish desires etc.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10023" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The picture of ourselves &#8211; as having a sophisticated mind sitting on top of a primitive one &#8211; is very helpful because it makes sense of some of our troubles and of our potential for addressing them. The primitive brain is very concerned with safety and reproduction. It is impatient. It’s violent in asserting itself. It has no interest in reasons and explanations. It cannot comprehend what an apology is. In some of our worst moments, the primitive brain is doing the work. From its point of view, smashing a glass on the table might be an ideal way of getting someone to agree with you; being insulting, aggressive and boorish might look like a great way of getting to have sex with someone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That we can behave very badly is, therefore, entirely unsurprising. But it means also that such bad behaviour cannot possible be the whole story about us. Having a divided brain &#8211; a reptilian and non-reptilian mind &#8211; means that the task is always to get the higher part of the mind to be more in charge and to take over whenever things get complicated. If we understand this about ourselves than we don’t have to go around thinking that we are totally worthless and awful because we did a genuinely very stupid and pretty nasty thing. The evolutionary story gives a more helpful explanation. You are not thoroughly bad at all. You just have a current problem: </span><b>your modern brain is not as strong as it needs to be &#8211; and your reptilian brain is far too strong.</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It defines the nature of the task: I need to get my non-reptile brain to be more prominent. And I need to learn to distinguish which of my hopes, fears and desires belong to the reptilian mind &#8211; and which are soundly founded in the higher rationality of the more evolved mind.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1606966927_7e92985360_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10024" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1606966927_7e92985360_z1.jpg?resize=631%2C420" alt="1606966927_7e92985360_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we can call </span><b>higher-consciousness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurs as we flex the muscles of our modern brain; and manage to free ourselves from the hold of the reptilian brain, gaining perspective over our immediate impulses and moods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another kind of language, we’d say we had been able to ‘free ourselves’ from the ego and to survey our lives and the world free of the immediate imperatives of being ourselves.</span></p>
<p><b>There are FIVE key ways this happens.</b></p>
<p><strong>One: Fostering a capacity to observe one’s cruder impulses</strong></p>
<p>Very occasionally, perhaps late at night, when the pressures of the day have receded, we have access to what feel like moments of wisdom &#8211; they usually don’t last very long but for a short period of time we have access to crucial ideas or insights about the way we operate, which is free of the normal subjectivity, defensiveness or self-justification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning &#8211; and for pretty much the whole day &#8211; you are in a rush. At dinner, your partner makes a comment about how you eat too fast or how you tune out when they are talking about their work &#8211; and immediately you get defensive; you insist you don’t do these things, you say they are hypercritical, that they don’t care and are always coldly judging you. You are furious and might slam the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12911788265_09662c1d0c_h.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10029" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12911788265_09662c1d0c_h.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="12911788265_09662c1d0c_h" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then lying awake in the middle of the night you have a powerful sense that quite often you move too fast defend yourself whenever your partner says anything a bit critical. You can picture yourself doing it. They start to speak, it’s so familiar, and immediately you are crouching, ready to deflect the blow. And so you don’t really hear what they have to say. You admit &#8211; very, very privately &#8211; that you do quite often stop paying attention when they talk about work; it’s not merely that you have stopped listening to all the ins and outs of life in their office; it’s that you have stopped paying attention to the way they are speaking, to what it means to them and why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, they’ve got a point. But you feel compelled to say they don’t. And truth be told you know you do eat too fast. Yes, it’s annoying to have it pointed out. But you realise that being a bit critical is a way your partner tries to show affection and care; it’s a possessive gesture on their part. You want to say you’re sorry, hug them, do it differently. In the dark it all makes sense.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8186451012_04fe7b325b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10026" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8186451012_04fe7b325b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8186451012_04fe7b325b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The midnight insight was right. It was a moment of self knowledge. It was a moment of ‘higher consciousness’ when it was possible to stand back from experience and see it more clearly. You felt sufficiently safe and calm to observe your own behaviour without rushing to either condemn or defend it. You became wiser about yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such states of mind are, however, intermittent. Most of the time we have to be very intent on defending our patch, on fighting our cause. We lack the calm to observe our primitive mind in action.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: Developing a capacity to interpret the behaviour of others, rather than merely react to it automatically</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, we respond immediately (and rather powerfully) to the behaviour of others.</span></p>
<p>They honk the horn at us, we get furious and honk back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say something mean-sounding, we insult them right back.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5122715574_8743ae767f.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10036" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5122715574_8743ae767f.jpg?resize=500%2C337" alt="5122715574_8743ae767f" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The natural instinct is to meet the primitive with the primitive. Our own reptile nature wants to attack their reptile selves and beat them back into their hole.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is, of course, another option &#8211; one of the great marvels of evolution and civilisation (morality and religion too).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The civilised, higher move is to understand that they are behaving badly </span><b><i>for a reason which they are in no position to tell you about, so under pressure are they from their more primitive minds.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they have had a hard day. Maybe they are worried about something. Perhaps they have felt squashed and sidelined in their career and now having someone squeeze in in front of them on the road is too much to bear. Instead of simply seeing them as the dangerous enemy, we can recognise that they are</span><b> distressed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that their bad behaviour (the impatient horn the swearing behind the windscreen) is a symptom of hurt rather than of ‘evil’.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10032" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-2.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="8691742996_5053244d52_z (2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to do this &#8211; to explain other people’s behaviour as caused by their distress, rather than simply to see it in terms of how it affects us. There must have been a first time in human history this happened. And in each life there is perhaps a similar awakening. But often it is so hard for this higher consciousness to break through; we are so deeply caught up in our own troubles that we find it almost impossible to be generous in our assessment of why others are causing us trouble:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out these ideas (they sound foreign); they are examples of higher consciousness:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sales assistant is being curt with your request, perhaps because his relationship is breaking up. It isn’t about you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the snobbish person at the party is, ultimately, insecure (although they look self-confident and have just ignored you).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lout who scratches your car is terrified of being exposed as sexually inadequate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the boaster at the bar is convinced that he can never be loved.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5782138278_c0c4433169_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10039" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5782138278_c0c4433169_z.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="5782138278_c0c4433169_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Three: Developing a capacity for universal love</strong></p>
<p>Once we are able to interpret someone’s pain-inducing behaviour as having roots in their own pain, we’re on the threshold of a remarkable steps. It then appears that in truth, no one in this world is ever simply ‘nasty’. They are always hurt &#8211; and this means that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism or aggression, but love.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we relinquish our egos, and loosen ourselves from the grip of our primitive defensive and aggressive thought-processes, we are free to consider humanity in a much more benign light. We might even, at an extreme (this might happen only very late at night once in a while), feel that we could love everyone, that no human could be outside the circle of our sympathy.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3870006964_4d20288227_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10043" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3870006964_4d20288227_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3870006964_4d20288227_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We attain a state reported by certain yogis, christian ascetics and buddhist monks &#8211; wherein we feel that we have loosened ourselves from the self: we are looking at the world as if we were not ourselves, without the usual filter of our interests, passions and needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the world, at that moment, reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort, a place full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have taken self-knowledge in a new and interesting direction. Being so aware of ourselves that we can remove the ‘lower self’ from the windscreen through which we look at things &#8211; and therefore look at things in a truer and unegoistic way.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10045" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years you have had to fight your corner: you have had to grab at every opportunity, defend yourself, look out for your interests. You have to feed and clothe yourself, pay the bills, manage your education, deal as best you can with your own moods and demons. You have to assert your rights, justify your actions and your choices. Being alive is all there is. You are understandably obsessed with your own life &#8211; what option do you have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are moments when one’s own life feels less precious, or less crucial &#8211; and not in a despairing way. And without the support of any imagined afterlife.  It might be that the fear of not-existing is &#8211; if only for a little while &#8211; less intense. Perhaps looking out over the ocean at dusk or walking in woodland in winter, or listening to a particular piece of music Bach’s double violin concerto, that it would be alright not to exist; one can contemplate a world in which one is no longer present with some tranquility and still feel appreciative of life. In such rare moments of higher consciousness, one’s mortality is less of a burden; one’s interests can be put aside;  you can fuse with transient things: trees, wind, waves breaking on the shore. From that higher point of view, status doesn’t seem important, possession don’t seem to matter, grievances lose their urgency; one is serene. If certain people could encounter you at this point they be amazed at the transformation.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4242313004_536e04d2d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10041" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4242313004_536e04d2d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4242313004_536e04d2d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These higher states of consciousness are short lived. We have to accept that. We shouldn’t aspire to make them permanent &#8211; because they don’t sit so well with many of the very important practical tasks that we need to attend to. We don’t need to be always in them. But we do need to make the most of them. We have to harvest them and preserve them so that we can have access to them when we need them most. The problem is that when we are in these higher states of mind we have highly important insights; but we lose access to them when we return to the ordinary conditions of life. And so we don’t get the benefit of the insight that was there in those special moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, religions have been very interested in this move. The Christian churches, for instance, cottoned onto the fact that at times we can recognise that we have been unfair and disloyal to others. It’s a huge triumph over the primitive mind which has little time for such possibilities. They established rituals designed to intensify, prolong and deepen these fragile insights. There was, for example, highly charged words of a special prayer, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confiteor:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sister </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I have sinned through my own fault, in thoughts and in my words, in what </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have done and in what I have failed to do&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that, ideally, on a very regular basis people would have a powerful experience of recognising that they might have been cruel, harsh, thoughtless, greedy or mean. It didn’t necessarily always work, of course, but the idea is highly significant. It’s an attempt to make this kind of experience less random. To give it more power in our lives and to make the best use of it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21413523192_d19249fbc6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10049" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21413523192_d19249fbc6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="21413523192_d19249fbc6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal, which is obviously separable from Christianity and involves not occult belief, is that the higher parts of the mind should be more reliable and more powerful.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: Developing a suspicion about your own feelings</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally we are used to the idea of gaining self-knowledge by asking ourselves ever more closely: </span><b><i>how do I feel about this?</i></b></p>
<p>The idea is that you know ‘who you really are’, by studying your feelings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this suggestion here is something different, indeed the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we advise is a capacity to stand aside from feelings in order to recognise their potentially deceptive nature. It means acknowledging a fundamental distinction between what we might </span><b><i>feel</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a situation &#8211; and what it might actually </span><b><i>be.</i></b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heliocentric.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10051" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heliocentric.jpg?resize=570%2C480" alt="Heliocentric" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classic example of this historically is when humans learnt for the first time to accept that even though the earth </span><b>feels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flat, it </span><b>is </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in fact round. In other words, when humans learnt to be suspicious about their feelings, trusting instead to the data of their rational minds &#8211; overruling feeling for the sake of reason. This has come very very late on in human evolution, and in day-to-day life, most of us operate in a pre-Copernican way, especially as regards our emotional lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One exception though, from which we can learn a lot, is children. When we deal with small children, we rather easily override our reptilian responses and aim for a higher interpretation. We look beyond what seems, and try to picture what is.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a child who is whiny and then goes up to its parent and hits it and says, I hate you.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2537892547_b563e18052_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10053" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2537892547_b563e18052_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="2537892547_b563e18052_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primitive response is to hit back. The more sophisticated one is to ask: what is going on beneath what I can see of the child’s behaviour?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, because it’s 6pm and they haven&#8217;t had a nap and had a bit of a cold, one will quite naturally ascribe the bad mood to these factors. The higher mind will have interpreted the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However wise this might be, we find it hard to perform the exercise on ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We too might be feeling tired and hungry. But we don’t ask ourselves what role this might be playing in our sudden sense that everyone hates us and that our careers are a disaster.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These seem like entirely reasonable conclusions to draw from real facts. But, in reality, they are the outcome of a very tired and hungry mind trying to deal with existence. After a snack and a lie down, our views will be very different.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2285728600_33d397fd36_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10061" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2285728600_33d397fd36_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2285728600_33d397fd36_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, our minds are filled with ideas that seem to be rationally founded but actually are not, that owe much to lower physical processes that are denied or unrecognised.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means becoming much better at realising how many of our mental processes (extending to things like our views on politics and our assessments of our careers and our lovers) can be explained by:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- not having drunk enough water</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- not having had enough sleep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- lacking something to eat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven&#8217;t slept well for a few nights and you&#8217;ve been working too hard, a few not too tactful comments from your partner can leave you considering divorce. It feels as if your relationship is in tatters, that you need to take a life-changing, dramatic and risky step; that the compromises, accommodations and love of the last few years have all been wasted. The problem looks enormous. But actually it isn&#8217;t. All that&#8217;s wrong is that you are tired. It&#8217;s shockingly hard for us to distinguish between a need of the body and a harrowing emotional conflict.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8727887079_23fa242666_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10057" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8727887079_23fa242666_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8727887079_23fa242666_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might be that, having skipped breakfast, a tricky work meeting leaves you determined to resign. Things will be tough, certainly, but anything is better than continuing to sell your soul to these mindless fools. The problem looks as if it is huge &#8211; one&#8217;s career has taken a calamitous turn. Yet the real cause may be no more than depleted blood-sugar levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being told that one&#8217;s view of existence is &#8211; at this moment &#8211; not the product of reason but of indigestion or exhaustion, is utterly maddening. Especially when it is true. We want to believe our woes are essentially all high flown &#8211; intellectual, moral and existential &#8211; when they are often no more, but also no less, than a disturbance of the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should be careful of over-intellectualising. To be happy, we require big things (money, freedom, love), but we need a lot of semi-insultingly little things too (enough sleep, a good diet, a sunny sky). Babies know this well. They&#8217;re usefully unintellectual. They&#8217;re on hand to remind us of some profound truths.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10176739514_18419fff1f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10059" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10176739514_18419fff1f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="10176739514_18419fff1f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operative question, then, isn’t always ‘how do I feel?’ Self-knowledge might equally derive from asking: how do I function? What role are emotions playing in my life? And it can lead us, crucially, at times to discount them despite their strength. This is the higher capacity to stand aside from one’s feelings.</span></p>
<p>When you are tired, dehydrated or hungry, stressed or frightened these states of mind alter your perception of reality. The sense become misleading. Other people’s behaviour is liable to look more menacing than it is; we find it harder to grasp their more complex motives. Threats look bigger than they are; sources of security or pleasure look smaller, more fragile and more distant than in truth they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The higher position is to recognise that this is a way the self functions. This is what tiredness, dehydration and such states do to us. So we know to be suspicious of certain states of mind, we have to learn not to act on them. Wisdom means getting better at asking: is this reality or might I be seeing things in a distorted way, due to a lack of lunch or 2 hours less sleep.</p>
<p><b>PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATION: ORDERING OUR MINDS RATHER THAN EMPTYING THEM</b></p>
<p>Even though our minds ostensibly belong to us, we don’t always control or know what is in them. There are always some ideas, bang in the middle of consciousness, that are thoroughly and immediately clear to us: for example, that we love our children. Or that we have to be out of the house by 7.40am. Or, that we are keen to have something salty to eat right now. These thoughts feel obvious without burdening us with uncertainty or any requirement that we reflect harder on them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a host of other ideas tend to hover in a far more unfocused state. For example, we may know that our career needs to change, but it’s hard to say much more. Or we feel some resentment against our partner over an upsetting incident the night before, but we can’t pin down with any accuracy what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. Our confusions sometimes have a positive character about them but are perplexing all the same: perhaps there was something deeply ‘exciting’ about a canal-side cafe we discovered in Amsterdam or the sight of a person reading on a train or the way the sun lit up the sky in the evening after the storm, but it may be equally hard to put a finger on the meaning of these feelings.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10063" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfocused thoughts are constantly orbiting our minds, but from where we are, from the observatory of our conscious selves (as it were), we can’t grasp them distinctly. We speak of needing to ‘sort our heads out’ or to ‘get on top of things’, but quite how one does something like this isn’t obvious – or very much discussed. There is one response to dealing with our minds that has become immensely popular in the West in recent years. Drawn from the traditions of Buddhism, the practice of meditation has gripped the Western imagination, presenting itself as a solution to the problems of our chaotic minds. It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults in the US has taken part in some form of structured meditation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adherents of meditation suggest that we sit very quietly, in a particular bodily position, and strive, through a variety of exercises, to empty our minds of content, quite literally to push or draw away the disturbing and unfocused objects of consciousness to the periphery of our minds, leaving a central space empty and serene. In the Buddhist world-view, anxieties and excitements are not trying to tell us anything especially interesting or valuable. We continuously fret without good purpose, about this or that random and vain thing – and therefore the best solution is simply to push the objects of the mind to one side.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11752252314_204952945b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10065" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11752252314_204952945b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="11752252314_204952945b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhist meditation has been so successful, we are liable to forget another effective and in some ways superior path to finding peace of mind, this one rooted in the Western tradition: Philosophical Meditation. Like its Eastern counterpart, Philosophical Meditation wants our thoughts, feelings and anxieties to trouble us less, but it seeks to sort out our minds in a very different manner. At heart, it doesn’t believe that the contents of our minds are nonsensical or meaningless. Our worries may seem like a nuisance but they are in fact neurotically garbled but important signals about how we should direct our lives. They contain complex clues as to our development. Therefore, rather than wanting simply to empty our minds of content, practitioners of Philosophical Meditation encourage us to clean these minds up: they want to bring the content that troubles us more securely into focus, and thereby usher in calm through understanding rather than through evacuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does one bring the confused objects of the mind into focus? There are instructions for Philosophical Meditation, just as there are for Buddhist Meditation (a little artificiality in these matters may just be what we need to lend the process discipline). The first priority is to set aside a bit of time, ideally 20 minutes, once a day. One should sit with a pad of paper and start by asking oneself a very simple set of questions: what is it that I am regretful, anxious or excited about at present? One is invited to download the immediate contents of one’s mind. One will by nature be a little unsure of what our feelings mean, so it is best simply to write down – without thinking or censoring ourselves – one or two words around each feeling. It’s a case of tipping out the contents of the mind onto the paper as unselfconsciously as possible. One might, for example, write down: Darren, Cologne trip, weekend, shoes, Mum, face at train station… The task is then to try to convert each of these words from an ambiguous and silent worry, regret or thrill into something one can understand, grasp, order and eventually better control. Success in this meditation relies on a skilful process of questioning. Imagine these thoughts as ineloquent and muddled strangers, who are full of valuable ideas, but whom one has to get to know in a roundabout way, by directing just the right questions at them.

<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2757337391_f0de45b060_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10068" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2757337391_f0de45b060_z.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="2757337391_f0de45b060_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophical Meditation brings us calm not by removing issues, but by helping us to understand them, thereby evaporating some of the paranoia and static that might otherwise cling to them. When confused objects of consciousness become clearer, they stop bothering us quite so much. Problems don’t disappear, but they assume proportion and can be managed. For example, we may make ourselves at home with an array of administrative worries that had been clumsily concealed under the vague title of ‘the Cologne trip’. The word ‘Darren’ might disclose someone we envy, but who holds out a fascinating run of clues as to how we might make a new move in our career. The word ‘weekend’ yields feelings towards one’s partner which are both resentful and yet capable of being discussed and perhaps worked through in the evening. Sorting out our minds doesn’t just feel comforting (like tidying our homes), it also spares us grave errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused excitement can be highly dangerous when it involves career ambitions. Imagine someone with a tendency to experience excitement when reading <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Gourmet Traveller</em> – and who then declares, without much attempt to analyse the feeling, that they want ‘to work in magazines’. It may seem reasonable enough for them to send off a CV to the magazine company HQ. After many efforts, they may be offered a lowly internship. It might take a few years and a lot of heartache before they realise that it wasn’t really the magazines themselves that were the true object of their attraction to begin with. Actually what was really speaking to this person was the idea of working in a close-knit team in an area that wasn’t finance (where Mum, a caustic and forbidding figure, puritanical in matters of sex and money, spent her career). Philosophical Meditation can, among other things, save us a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13903354509_d6a32bed18_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10073" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13903354509_d6a32bed18_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="13903354509_d6a32bed18_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar dangers play out when one is upset or anxious. Imagine that yesterday you had dinner at the house of a conspicuously successful friend. They’d just got back from a holiday in the Maldives and were telling you about their latest business venture in pharmaceuticals. You left feeling restless and annoyed, but you didn’t know why. Your own life felt flat and dispiriting. Vague plans about what to do swirled around in your head. Maybe you could have a brilliant idea and start a business. Somehow you wanted your life to be more like your friend’s. But what is a brilliant idea in business? How does one get going? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then your partner said something about having set up a dinner with her mother. At that moment, from somewhere mysterious in you, you felt a wave of anger – and shouted something about the house always being left in such a mess. After all, there was a set of dirty plates in your field of vision. But your partner said you were crazy, the house wasn’t that messy anyway, and how long would it take to tidy away a few plates in the first place…? She walked out of the room crossly and so tonight, you’ll be sleeping on the sofa again for a whole set of reasons that it’s now becoming very hard to disentangle, let alone discuss with any degree of maturity.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2653370805_916f7c7b40_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10077" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2653370805_916f7c7b40_o.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="2653370805_916f7c7b40_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our confused inner experiences. We pick the wrong job; get together with the wrong person, run away from the right person; spend our money on the wrong things and don’t do justice to our talents and deeper aspirations. Acting without Philosophical Meditation is like being allowed to embark on a trip without checking the equipment or the map. We trust the feelings without duly acknowledging that they may prompt us in some catastrophic directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longing to empty the mind, to calm turbulent thoughts isn’t completely opposed to the exercise of cleaning up the mind, decoding, analysing and ordering its contents. It’s just that at the moment, as societies, we have allowed ourselves to get overly seduced by the promise of tranquility, so that we always strive to empty the mind, instead of attempting to understand its contents. We see our agitation as the result of thinking too much, rather than of not having – as yet – thought enough. It’s time for our societies to take on board the promises and advantages of Philosophical Meditation.</span></p>

<p><b>THE ART OF CONVERSATION: </b></p>
<p><b>HOW CAN ONE IMPROVE and SPEED UP SELF-KNOWLEDGE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key ways in which we can get to know ourselves and others is through conversation. Unfortunately, we tend to have a ‘Romantic’ conception of conversation. We believe that in the right setting – distressed old wooden tables, food from Liguria, bruschetta – conversation will flow naturally, without special effort.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6268209746_06e24576aa_b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10087" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6268209746_06e24576aa_b1.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="6268209746_06e24576aa_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that conversation is an achievement, something we might need to learn. Key to it is having the right questions to hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approach self-knowledge as a game. It can be fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at some very good questions to ask via the 100x question packs done by the School of Life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:</span></p>
<p>What would you most like to be complimented on in a relationship? Where do you think you’re especially good as a person?</p>
<p>Which of your flaws do you want to be treated more generously?</p>
<p>What would you tell your younger self about love?</p>
<p>What is one incident you would like to apologise to a lover or friend for?</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9564599905_534e9ca52d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10081" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9564599905_534e9ca52d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C370" alt="9564599905_534e9ca52d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Finish the following sentences:</p>
<p>When I am anxious in a relationship, I tend to….</p>
<p>The other then tends to respond by….</p>
<p>which makes me…</p>
<p>When I argue, on the surface I show ……, but inside I feel….</p>
<p>Without thinking too hard, let’s finish these sentence stems about our feelings towards one another:</p>
<p>I resent…</p>
<p>I am puzzled by…</p>
<p>I am hurt by…</p>
<p>I regret…</p>
<p>I am afraid that…</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2157057475_af66695f52_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10083" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2157057475_af66695f52_z.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="2157057475_af66695f52_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I am frustrated by…</p>
<p>I am happier when…</p>
<p>I want…</p>
<p>I appreciate…</p>
<p>I hope…</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><b>What does the wise person end up knowing about themselves?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what individuals know is specific to them. But we can still identify the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of things they know. If someone gains a lot of self-knowledge how would this show up in their behaviour? How would self-knowledge impact on their lives? Self-knowledge isn’t so much a set of statements that one gives assent to. Rather it’s a set of capacities for dealing better with one’s needs and weaknesses and generally being better at handling oneself. The wise, self-knowing person &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would be less prone to blame others for their troubles. They get upset, they get bothered, they feel anxious; things still go wrong. But self-knowledge admits the full extent of responsibility. So annoyance doesn’t get channelled into being angry with the wrong person &#8211; who isn’t really to blame.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d likely be less frustrated at work: it’s not that they have the perfect job. They know themselves well enough to seek out the kind of work they can do comfortably; they don’t push needlessly to get ahead; they can cope fairly well with criticism, so they don’t get unduly anxious in a competitive environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d panic a bit less: panic is caused by fear; and mostly the fear is psychological, rather than physical &#8211; fear of humiliation of rejection or being bored. Great self-knowledge diminishes these fears.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d be less prone to envy &#8211; because envy often comes from not quite knowing what you really need.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10085" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t stress quite so much about money; that’s because they are more alert to what really matters to them; they are less given to impulse spending; they are better at saving.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They might have fewer crushes. They don’t project wildly onto others and so are less likely to suppose that a stranger glimpsed on a train or at the next table is their ideal soul-mate.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are good at apologising, partly because they can fully appreciate that they are at times very annoying &#8211; even if unintentionally so &#8211; to others. They can mull over the fact that they might be in the wrong, without getting too defensive.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They tend to be good conversationalists. Because they are alert to why they do things as they do &#8211; and don’t merely assert what they do think. They’re also slow to assume that others automatically think as they do. They can identify widely with different kinds of people because they can pick up on many different aspects of their own experience at different stages of life.</span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though charming people are a delight when we encounter them, most of us rarely think of consciously setting out to be charming. The very idea of learning to be more charming sounds off-key, for we tend to believe at some level that we are simply born charming or aren’t &#8211; and that any conscious attempt to acquire the quality would be fatefully lacking in authenticity. In other words, it seems rather wrong to think too hard about trying to get people to like us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a pity, given how many important things need to be accompanied by a dose of charm in order to get going in the world. Ideas, projects, political proposals and people all stand in need of being presented in a charming way if they are to succeed and win an audience. It therefore seems a grievous surrender to fortune to leave charm only to those who spontaneously possess it &#8211; or to the apparently unscrupulous who are sanguine about plotting directly to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5803157877_aa26beb765_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9557" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5803157877_aa26beb765_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5803157877_aa26beb765_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, charm is a technique, neither sinister nor moral in itself, that can be used for good or ill and whose ultimate value depends on the purpose to which it is being applied. The world would be well served if the mechanics of charm were studied with particular energy by those with the best ends in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, then, are some of the leading constituents of charm?</span></p>
<p><b>Familiarity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We grow up with an idea of politeness which is based on reigning in most of what human beings are and feel. This is often an extremely good idea. It can be deeply unpleasant to be given too close a tour of another person’s inner nature: their obsessions, envy, vindictiveness, despair or odours. Repression serves a sound overall function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, we can overshoot in this direction. We can end up associating politeness with such a stiff-backed reserve, we can be so coy about all the deeper, more appetitive, impulsive and emotional sides of our natures, that far from proving ingratiating, we end up repelling others through the blank impassivity of our facades.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9559" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The charming person understands that winning others over requires a careful revelation of some of the more intimate parts of themselves. They will, for example, express an opinion which runs counter to a standard line, but seems to better accord with the truth (that museum show really was a little tedious). Or maybe they will share an anxiety, a regret or a desire &#8211; moves which give others perspectives on more vulnerable, intimate dimensions. They might point out that they’re rather worried about a forthcoming meeting, sometimes think nostalgically back to being a child or occasionally feel like crying when they see a very old person in the street. They might, at a stiff dinner, say that they would love to drink a Coke.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the charming person is careful not to allow these revelations to spill over into demands on others: regrets don’t turn into whines, desires don’t lapse into compulsions; wayward appetites don’t disrupt routines. The charming person is master over themselves, they are allowing us a glimpse into a self which is at once complex and contained.</span></p>
<p><b>Warmth</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When trying to win others over, we try to make sure they are comfortable, at ease and have what they need. Hospitality is at the heart of charm.</span></p>
<p>However, when we are stiff (and scared), we operate with an unhelpful picture of what other people might really be like and in need of inside &#8211; and therefore cannot arrive at convincing accounts of what they would enjoy talking about, doing with their bodies, looking at or eating.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8590519418_6d9514c589_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9565" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8590519418_6d9514c589_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8590519418_6d9514c589_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for our lack of insight is that we are forgetting that others are likely to be &#8211; in most areas &#8211; really much like ourselves, which means rather different from the predominant social account of what ‘normal’ people are like. They too, are likely to share in some of our less prestigious but still deep-seated and important thoughts and needs. Even though nothing in their current demeanour would lead one to know this for certain, they too must &#8211; the ‘warm’ person guesses (out of a confidence in their own acceptability built up in a non-shaming childhood) &#8211; want to lounge on the sofa, eat things out of the fridge without ceremony, have a giggle, watch a particular show on TV or share a few lustful thoughts. The warm person has a secure enough sense of their own fundamental decency to be able to bring their own experiences into play when interpreting other people’s desires. They are asking themselves how they would be feeling in another’s shoes &#8211; and using this information in an active attempt to put others at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charming people will correctly hazard a guess that the other person might want to rest for a few hours or fancy discussing a couple at the table opposite or dance to some not especially fashionable music. They’ll know how important it is to know where the bathroom is and add that they often need to go themselves. They’ll know that it’s worrying for everyone (not just them) to meet a new person &#8211; and playfully allude to their shyness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warm person has confidence in always being able to locate common ground, shared themes of vulnerable life that can overcome differences in cultures, ages or ranks.</span></p>
<p><b>Equality</b></p>
<p>Many encounters feature someone who is more powerful or important than somebody else; an inequality that can make for tension and anxiety &#8211; despite efforts to be polite.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2781182428_7274320116_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9567" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2781182428_7274320116_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2781182428_7274320116_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The powerful but charming person grasps that the predominant fear in their audience is that their status will have rendered them arrogant and invulnerable. They therefore take care very swiftly to say or do something that asserts their fundamental equality in areas outside of their obvious zone of superiority; they may be the CEO, but their toddler had a tantrum today (children are the best possible equalisers). They might have a great deal of money, but they have suffered a romantic misfortune. They are the King, but are &#8211; right now &#8211; dying to have a cheese sandwich, as you must be too. The frailties and ordinary desires of the powerful have a profoundly charming dimension, because we need so badly to hear that power understands our own concerns, needs and fears. What we call being charmed is, at heart, simply immense relief that we are not alone with our sorrows and difficulties in a stratified, hierarchical world.</p>
<p><b>Unshockability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charming person allays our fears, universal in their existence though always particular in their nature, that we are at heart freakish, odd or shameful. They send out signals that we have leeway to reveal the less well-known and prestigious sides of our natures &#8211; because they are, they let on subtly, a little weird themselves and have a good-natured, unfrightened sense of the ubiquity of madness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8707472000_882c6bbedd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9569" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8707472000_882c6bbedd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="8707472000_882c6bbedd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolved of the fear of being weird, we are then free to explain what we really need ourselves: perhaps another blanket, a lie-down, a conversation about a lover or a long trip to the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><b>Curiosity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charming person feels curious about others. They ask a lot of penetrating and energetic questions about the new person they have just encountered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They aren’t just putting this on; their curiosity is the outcome of an underlying intellectual position on education. In essence, the curious person has a sense that they could learn from pretty much anyone they could meet. They don’t restrict curiosity to particular situations or people. They realise that there is something to be learnt pretty much everywhere, in every topic of conversation. They are therefore enriched rather than impoverished by social encounters. An account of someone’s holiday, the latest twist in the life of a pop star, a reflection on the weather, all of these can be sound enough starting points for substantial discoveries and therefore, the conversational direction of their interlocutors are never merely stamped out, but carefully extended and deepened.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3782142845_9ac60355d8_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9573" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3782142845_9ac60355d8_o.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3782142845_9ac60355d8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The curious person feels that bits of the truth have become lodged in a huge variety of topics &#8211; a cognitive version of the Christian idea that there is a bit of the divine in everyone. They have no sense of restriction about where they might land upon something interesting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors are what make a person charming. They are not mysterious, random gifts of nature. They are, instead, the result of certain strategic bits of knowledge and insight. Becoming more charming is a matter of taking to heart these ideas around warmth, equality, unshockability and curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charming isn’t simply a nice optional extra. It’s central to dealing effectively with practical problems. We’re so often held up by difficulties with other people, who we struggle to persuade, motivate and get on side. Charm is a major mechanism for having an impact. The more important and worthwhile our objectives the more important it is to be able to deploy charm to further them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charm is neither superficial nor the special preserve of those with questionable intentions. At its best, it is a virtue which enables good people to extend their influence in the world.  </span></p>

<p class="p1">We apparently live in an age of honesty and disclosure but in truth most of what we are remains unacceptable and disguised to the world. We simply cannot show too much of our real natures and retain the affections of others. As a result, we&#8217;re lonely with parts of our characters we simply don&#8217;t hear anyone else admitting to. One of the functions of art is to break that loneliness, by taking us into the secret unmentioned thoughts with dignity and occasional humor.</p>
<p class="p1">The films below gently show us that in our hearts, almost all of us are rather more envious, internet addicted, romantic and greedy than we are ever able to let on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re sometimes not too sure how we get into good friendships. It seems to happen rather mysteriously: we talk of somewhat randomly “clicking” with people. Trying to plan for it sounds like cheating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is something at the heart of many friendships that seems important to identify and &#8211; in a way &#8211; to get good at: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vulnerability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8914" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z.jpg?resize=635%2C510" alt="205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too easy to assume that what makes us likeable are our strengths, our accomplishments, the things we’re proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">impresses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it isn’t what draws others to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get close to someone the more they &#8211; and we &#8211; find ourselves able gracefully to depart from the official story of what human beings are like, and can start to show the awkward truths which underlie the cheerful facade. These are the truths with which we have been lonely for too long: how unlike ‘normal’ sexuality our sex lives actually are; how full of envy our careers are proving; how unsatisfactory our family can be; how worried we are all the time.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/487117524_a761fb1df6_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8912" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/487117524_a761fb1df6_o.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="487117524_a761fb1df6_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revealing any of these things places us in great danger. Others could laugh; social media would have a field day. That’s the point. We can only get close by revealing things that would, in the wrong hands, be capable of inflicting appalling humiliation on us. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgement that one has offered something very valuable to someone: not a fancy present, but something even more precious, the key to one’s self-esteem and dignity.</span></p>
<p>It’s deeply poignant that we should expend so much effort on trying to look strong before the world &#8211; when, all the while, it’s really only ever the revelation of the somewhat embarrassing, sad, melancholy and anxious bits of us that are what makes us endearing to others, and can transform strangers into friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we fail and mess up in our lives (perhaps a project at work goes wrong or a relationship ends), our moods are at risk of heading towards two extremes: self-pity on the one hand, where it is exclusively everyone else’s fault and we bathe in a sense of our innocence and purity. And on the other, self-flagellation, where we blame only ourselves, tear ourselves apart and constantly replay evidence of our waywardness and sheer stupidity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-flagellation is &#8211; for many of us &#8211; the greater risk. To survive in the high-pressured conditions of modernity, we have little option but to grow up to be highly adept at self-criticism, at swiftly picking up on our errors and taking stock of our short-comings. We learn to take responsibility and to be open to feedback. But so good are we at this that we’re in danger of falling prey to an excessive version of self-criticism: a form of self-flagellation which teaches us nothing new and inspires only depression and underperformance. We have taken self-criticism too far when it no longer has any effect on our level of achievement, when it simply saps our morale and our will to get out of bed.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/466817135_812705e91f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8839" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/466817135_812705e91f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="466817135_812705e91f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s at this point that we need to carve out some time to sample an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious: self-compassion. We’re suspicious because we are nervously over-familiar with the risks associated with self-pity. We are frightened creatures always looking out for signs that we have grown soft. Most of us will have given up on the last traces of self-pity somewhere in late adolescence, but the condition remains vivid. We are aware that, by being kind to ourselves, we may over-indulge our undeserving characters, miss valuable insights and ruin our potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because depression and self-disgust are serious enemies too, we need to re-learn the value of calculated moments of self-compassion; we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8842" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this end, we should perform a Self-Compassion Exercise, a structured Meditation (lasting 15 minutes or so) where we turn over a sequence of thoughts in our minds that correct the worst self-accusations of our sadder moments. For a time, until we are stronger, we vow to adopt an entirely kindly perspective on our setbacks. We have failed, but the conclusion does not have to be that we are idiots. The following ideas can be rehearsed:</span></p>
<p><strong>1. The task was very hard</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re so in love with success, we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we are trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. We weren’t properly equipped by our histories</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to consider our biographies in their entireties; not just this or that setback, but the course of our lives as a whole. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain our current failures. We were not responsible for everything. We are in part victims of things beyond our control. We are not in complete command of who we are, and shouldn’t &#8211; therefore &#8211; be held to account for everything.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16777983089_f0353ce88b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8847" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16777983089_f0353ce88b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16777983089_f0353ce88b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Failure is not unique</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of the task means there is always a high possibility of failure. Failure is rarely spoken about. The media talks mostly of successes (or the spectacular blow-ups), but statistically, what has happened to us was always going to be more likely. ‘Better men fared thus before you,’ said Matthew Arnold, people who are even more talented than you didn’t succeed. It isn’t just that you are a fool: it was a mountain to climb.</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Luck is real</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tough, self-critical people don’t allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck. They don’t. Luck is a genuine feature of existence. We are robbing ourselves of genuine and fair consolation by believing that we are entirely in control &#8211; and therefore entirely to blame when we crash. We are not losers in a game that was fair. We are unfortunates in an often highly random unlucky universe.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15827903959_b3976cba53_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8851" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15827903959_b3976cba53_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15827903959_b3976cba53_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Your whole worth is not dependent on external things</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your essential lovability does not have to be at stake in this issue. You are not only your achievements. Status and material success is one bit of you, but there are lots of other parts too. Those who loved you in childhood knew this and, in their best moments, helped you to feel it. Adopt a maternal relationship with yourself: rehearse the internalised voices of all those who have been kind to you, bathe in an intrinsic absolute love independent of achievement. Imagine a maternal figure. Let yourself listen to voices you haven’t given time for in years. Perhaps it isn’t unconditional love, it’s just that there are other conditions for love, which you happen to pass quite well. You are kind, interesting, witty, sensitive, bold, imaginative&#8230; Modern society has over-emphasised certain conditions for love, pegging them too neatly to a narrow range of victories. You should be allowed to exist and tolerate yourself without these badges.</span></p>
<p><strong>6. There is a way out of this that you can’t quite see now</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are exhausted, and panicked. You can’t see how you could move on from this. That’s not the truth, it’s merely how it feels when self-criticism has destroyed every bit of confidence. You need time without pressure. You need to sleep and nurture yourself. We have grown too good at giving the case to the prosecution. Shut out the voice of Duty and Anger.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/233842170_4bf3079c3d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8854" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/233842170_4bf3079c3d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C649" alt="233842170_4bf3079c3d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-compassion is different from saying you are innocent. It&#8217;s trying to be pretty gentle and understanding about why you failed. You’ve been a fool, but you deserve to exist with dignity and to be understood and forgiven. It’s a fundamental right for us all.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our brains are brilliant instruments, able to reason, synthesise, remember and imagine at an extraordinary pitch and rate. We trust them immediately and innately &#8211; and have reasons to be deeply proud of them too.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, these brains &#8211; let’s call them walnuts in honour of their appearance &#8211; are also very subtly and dangerously flawed machines, flawed in ways that typically don’t announce themselves to us and therefore give us few clues as to how on guard we should be about our mental processes. Most of the walnut’s flaws can be attributed to the way the instrument evolved over millions of years. It emerged to deal with threats, some of which are no longer with us, and at the same time, it had no chance to develop adequate responses to a myriad of challenges generated by our own complex societies. We should feel pity for its situation and compassion for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7785" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b.jpg?resize=635%2C644" alt="4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attempting to live requires us to adopt a focused and ongoing scepticism towards a great many of the ideas, schemes, plans and feelings generated by the faulty walnut that stands at the top of our spinal column.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are just some of the many things we need to watch out for:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut is influenced by the body to an extent it doesn’t recognise:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut is extremely bad at understanding why it is having certain thoughts and ideas. It tends always to attribute them to rational, objective conditions out in the world, rather than seeing that they might be stemming from the impact of the body upon its thought processes. It doesn’t typically notice the role that levels of sleep, sugar, hormones and other physiological factors play upon the formation of ideas. The walnut adheres to a psychological intepretation of plans and positions that are, at base, frequently merely physiological. Therefore, it can feel certain that the right answer is to divorce or leave the job rather than go back to bed or eat something to raise blood sugar levels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/888373079_404a5b6556_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7786" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/888373079_404a5b6556_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="888373079_404a5b6556_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut is influenced by its past, but can’t see its own projections:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut believes it is judging each new situation on its own merits, but it is inevitably drawing upon patterns of action and feeling shaped in previous years. This saves time, and has real evolutionary advantages, except that many situations in the present are in fact deceptive, resembling the past only enough to trigger a familiar response, while in fact having many unique characteristics that get overlooked. At moments of ambiguity, the walnut can jump to some catastrophic conclusions. It might, for example, assume that any older man who speaks in a confident way is out to humiliate them, when actually it was just one man, their father, who did this &#8211; or it will find it hard to get close to all women because one specific woman happened to be a source of trauma between the ages of 1 and 10. It’s deeply understandable, but very regrettable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut doesn’t like to stop and think:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut evolved for rapid, instinctive decision-making &#8211; and has a grievously hard time stepping back to address what we might term the big first order questions. It will always be keener to do than reflect, to act rather than analyse. Remember that philosophy is, at best 2,000 years old. We prefer to keep running a business the way it’s always been run rather than stop and ask: what would it mean to properly help our customers? We rush to book a holiday rather than pause and reflect on what we really enjoyed about past trips. We form an ambition to break into journalism because we enjoy being ‘creative’ rather than analysing the component parts of our interests. We hence miss our own vagueness, inconsistency and confusion. So bad is the walnut at thinking, it often needs another walnut nearby to help it along its way. Thinking generates anxiety and a desire to run fast in the opposite direction because of the difficult truths the walnut might unearth. But in the presence of another walnut, we can’t so easily bolt and turn back to the web. That’s why philosophy started as a conversation and psychoanalysis depends on two people unpacking one person’s thoughts and associations. Sadly, we rarely call on other walnuts to help us analyse, and usually pass the time with walnuts chatting idly about sport or the latest celebrity scandal. In short, the walnut is very good at seeing what others are up to, but finds it hugely hard to gain insights into itself. It can take it thirty years to gradually gain an insight that was obvious to a stranger within 2 minutes. The walnut seems to be a machine that’s not designed to look at itself (like our eyes can’t see the middle of our backs).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7787" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is bad at self-control and gets passionate about, and scared of the wrong things:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut constantly gets excited about things which aren’t good for it: sugar, salt and sex with strangers for a start. Advertising knows how to exploit this cognitive frailty to perfection. Our confusions can generally be traced back to targets that would once have been crucial and fitting for us to focus on. Our desires used to be reliable in simpler environments, but in the complicated conditions of modernity, they cause chaos. The same holds true for our fears: in the past, fears were simply bound to things that could kill us. Fears were a good idea to get us out of genuine dangers. But nowadays, many things excite our fear systems without there being any real threat. We have panic attacks before speaking in public for no good reason &#8211; while at the same time, the real, more subtle threats of modernity (global warming or another subprime mortgage financial crisis) evade our detection radars entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is egocentric, not polycentric:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut is primed to look at things from its own point of view. It often simply can’t believe that there are other ways of considering an issue. Other people can therefore seem perverse, or horrible to it &#8211; sparking outrage or self-pity. It’s only in the last second, from an evolutionary point of view, that the walnut has started to try to imagine what it might be like to be someone else (a symptom of this is that it’s learnt to take pleasure in novels). But this is still a fragile empathetic capacity, which tends to collapse, especially when the walnut is tired, and someone is trying to persuade it of a strange-sounding idea.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is intellectually squeamish:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut doesn’t like uncomfortable information. It doesn’t want to hear about problems. It looks out for information that confirms its biases and choices. It hates being the devil’s advocate. It favours short-term comfort over long-term growth and evolution. If confronted with a disquieting fact, it will tend to repress or skirt it. The walnut places self-protection way above truth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut isn’t an independent thinker:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut grew up dependent for its survival on the mood of the group or clan. It is therefore highly primed to fit in with common sense and prevailing opinion. It doesn’t generally like to use itself as a source of original data or insight. Other people’s opinions matter hugely irrespective of how foolish they might be &#8211; or indeed widespread. Because we came from small groups, one or two compliments can delight us; one criticism can sow panic. This is tricky in the age of Twitter. We get hypersensitive to what an absurdly small number of others believe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7789" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut misunderstands causality:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut used to think it might have been responsible for the lightning in the sky and that earthquakes were a result of its own bad thoughts and deeds. It took a while for that skewed perspective to be overcome. But the walnut still projects personal dynamics and overproduces generalities based on things that have happened to it: it stays trapped by personal rather than statistical or objective experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being more vigilant about the flaws in our walnuts gives us a range of important advantages: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- we get better at noticing the potential of flaws in our own judgement &#8211; and therefore stand a higher chance of not making them. We can only start to avoid mistakes when we know mistakes are an active possibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- when we deal with other people, we can ask ourselves whether they might be acting from a walnut flaw, but not know it. This will make us both bolder about disagreeing with them and also kinder and more generous in the face of their less than sensible behaviours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7791" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- when we deal with large groups of people, we can be aware that the walnut does very weird things in packs &#8211; but that’s OK and no reason to panic if we find our ideas are meeting with resistance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, compensating for the faulty equipment that nature has given us is the task of what we call: education, culture and civilisation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The flaws in the walnut are also what makes it imperative that we try to act with kindness and tolerance: we should at all times go easy on ourselves and others, for we’re trying to do some very difficult things around one another, with the use of a highly troublesome and only intermittently accurate tool.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Evolution is one of the biggest ideas in the modern world. It was most memorably formulated by Charles Darwin in the 19th century.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the theory focuses on the tendency of genes to mutate. When a frog – or microbe or giraffe – has a gene mutation, it usually that means they’ll be unsuited to their environment and they’ll die.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But very occasionally, just by chance, the mutation gives them an advantage and makes them more successful. The mutation is passed on to their descendants, who will have the same advantage as their parents, and their resultant success will spread it ever further down the generations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7620" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg?resize=635%2C593" alt="684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Charles Darwin</h5>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the key thing about gene mutation is that it takes time: a lot of it. It took us around 3,900 million years to go from the first cells to homo sapiens. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the one thing we can be pretty sure about is that genetic mutation will not be a significant feature of the human world now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there’s a second, equally interesting bit to Darwin’s theory of Evolution, which focuses on what gets called Adaptation to the Environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin pointed out that when an environment changes, a characteristic can suddenly shift from being an advantage to a disadvantage &#8211; and vice versa. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1811, a famous survey of moths around the burgeoning town of Manchester recorded no melanic &#8211; or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>black-winged &#8211; moths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thirty-seven<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>years later, in 1848,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>another survey discovered huge number of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>creatures and far fewer white winged moths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin’s explanation was simple: Manchester’s rise as a major industrial city meant that huge quantities of soot had entered the atmosphere and darkened tree trunks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thereafter, light-winged moths became highly conspicuous to their main predators &#8211; birds &#8211; while the dark winged ones were effectively camouflaged. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7621" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin concluded that changes to the environment can dramatically alter which members of a species will thrive within it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This happens in the human world, where it doesn’t affect reproductive potential, but does change the social hierarchy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider, for instance, the classic example of our age: the rise of the nerd. Being short sighted, timid, having poor muscular development, being obsessed with complex abstract processes and being short on charisma and social skills used to be a recipe for an unsuccessful life. That’s because, for most of history, making your way in the world was hugely dependent on physical strength and and strong practical links to a family group. The weakling, the loner, the introvert was in a very disadvantageous position. Then, in the last quarter of the 20th century, the tech industry created an environment in which nerd characteristics turned out to be highly advantageous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4668258939_fa22a95d40_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7622" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4668258939_fa22a95d40_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4668258939_fa22a95d40_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human beings are not themselves now evolving (or too slowly to matter), but our environment is changing very fast, and this has hugely privileged certain traits while penalising others. A key dynamic of evolution &#8211; Adaptation to the Environment &#8211; is still around, even though gene mutation is not a notable factor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us are like the black moths of Industrial Manchester, ideally suited to the new world, which rewards massive intellect, self-discipline and rationality. Others &#8211; many many of us &#8211; are like white moths in a sooty world. We find it hard to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– not to eat too much</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to distinguish real threats from baseless anxieties</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to spend all day in an office in front of a computer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to look at porn in moderation</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to be monogamous</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– and to defer gratification for years while we collaborate on large projects inside the glass towers of corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should feel compassion for ourselves when we don’t quite fit our times. Our biology has saddled us with a range of cognitive habits which were sensible when they evolved (habits around sugar, sex, power, anxiety and excitement)… but which really hamper our effectiveness in the modern world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An understanding of the theory of evolution should move us to sympathy for why we do some of the deeply counterproductive things we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he first wrote about evolution, Charles Darwin was accused of demeaning human nature. Cartoonists loved to draw him as an ape. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7623" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg?resize=450%2C583" alt="5.Darwin as monkey.jpg- acr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Darwin was deeply kind and helpful to humans. He was reminding us that we carry with us a lot of baggage, which we won’t now need but can’t get rid of very fast. Modern life has required things of us which are really very hard for us to pull off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We’re saddled with many inconvenient but maddeningly deep-rooted tendencies &#8211; which is another reason why we constantly need to be a little more forgiving of other people and of ourselves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re continually being bombarded with suggestions about what we might do (go jet skiing, study in Colorado, visit the Maldives or see the Pyramids). We’re always hearing of the amazing things friends have done or are going to do: ‘there was this great bar we all went to &#8230;’; ‘she’s getting married in a little country church, then we’re having a picnic&#8230;’; ‘the sun was glinting on Sydney Harbour&#8230;’ There are endless hints of the allure of life in other places: an article about family-friendly restaurants in Brooklyn, a crime novel set in Trieste, the departure board at the airport with its list of places only a plane trip away: Moscow, Bangkok, Addis Ababa… The modern world makes sure we know at all times just how much we’re missing. It is a culture in which intense and painful doses of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) are almost inevitable.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6270" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="14629023047_fa4cf0220e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are, fundamentally, two ways in which the brute facts of missing out can be viewed: one can take a Romantic or a Classical approach.</p>
<p>To the Romantic temperament, missing out causes immense agony. Somewhere else, noble and interesting and attractive people are living exactly the life that should be yours. You’d be so happy, if only you could be over there, at that party, with those people or working in that agency off Washington Square or holidaying in that shack in Jutland. Sometimes it makes you want to burst into tears.</p>
<p>The Romantic believes in the idea of a defined centre where the most exciting things are happening. At one time it was New York, for a few years it was Berlin; then London. Now, it’s probably San Francisco and in five years it may be Auckland – or perhaps Rio.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3233070.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5881" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3233070.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="El Morocco New Year" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For the Romantic, humanity is divided into a large group of the mediocre – and a tribe of the elect: artists, entrepreneurs, the edgy part of the fashion world and the people doing creative things with tech. As a Romantic, it can be exhausting inside your soul. Your mother sometimes drives you nuts: her life is utterly dull. How can she accept it? Why isn’t she itching to move to the Bay area? She’s always suggesting you take a job in Birmingham or inviting you on walking holidays in the Lake District. Sometimes you are quite rude to her. You avoid certain people like the plague: the shy friend from school who struggles with their weight; the flatmate who’s a telecoms engineer and wants to go into local politics. Being around individuals who are so unglamorous and lacking in ambition can feel pretty fatal.</p>
<p>For their part, classically-minded people acknowledge that there are of course some genuinely marvellous things going on in the world, but they doubt that the obvious signs of glamour are a good guide to finding them. The best novel in the world, they like to think, is probably not currently winning prizes or storming up the bestseller lists. It may be being written at this moment by an arthritic woman living in the otherwise unremarkable Latvian town of Liepāja.</p>
<p>Classical people are intensely aware that good qualities coexist with some extremely ordinary ones. Everything is rather jumbled up. Lamentable taste in jumpers is compatible with extraordinary insight. Academic qualifications can give no indication of true intelligence. Famous people can be dull. Obscure ones can be remarkable. At a perfect launch party, drinking sandalwood cocktails at the coolest bar in the world, you could feel sad and anxious. You might have the deepest conversations of you life with your aunt – even though she likes watching snooker on television and has stopped dying her hair.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/484149705.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5883" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/484149705.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="Elderly Care" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The classical temperament also fears missing out but has a rather different list of things they are afraid of not enjoying: getting to truly know one’s parents, learning to cope well with being alone; appreciating the consoling power of trees and clouds; discovering what their favourite pieces of music really mean to them, chatting to a seven year old child&#8230; As these wise souls know, one can indeed miss out on such extremely important things if one is always rushing a little too intently to find excitement elsewhere, heading off in haste to that stylish bar with the see-through elevator packed with some of the city’s top creatives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Even though our minds ostensibly belong to us, we don’t always control or know what is in them. There are always some ideas, bang in the middle of consciousness, that are thoroughly and immediately clear to us: for example, that we love our children. Or that we have to be out of the house by 7.40am. Or, that we are keen to have something salty to eat right now. These thoughts feel obvious without burdening us with uncertainty or any requirement that we reflect harder on them.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But a host of other ideas tend to hover in a far more unfocused state. For example, we may know that our career needs to change, but it’s hard to say much more. Or we feel some resentment against our partner over an upsetting incident the night before, but we can’t pin down with any accuracy what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. Our confusions sometimes have a positive character about them but are perplexing all the same: perhaps there was something deeply ‘exciting’ about a canal-side cafe we discovered in Amsterdam or the sight of a person reading on a train or the way the sun lit up the sky in the evening after the storm, but it may be equally hard to put a finger on the meaning of these feelings.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2422" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/129344029.jpg" alt="Pastor Johnnie Moore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfocused thoughts are constantly orbiting our minds, but from where we are, from the observatory of our conscious selves (as it were), we can’t grasp them distinctly. We speak of needing to ‘sort our heads out’ or to ‘get on top of things’, but quite how one does something like this isn’t obvious – or very much discussed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is one response to dealing with our minds that has become immensely popular in the West in recent years. Drawn from the traditions of Buddhism, the practice of meditation has gripped the Western imagination, presenting itself as a solution to the problems of our chaotic minds. It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults in the US has taken part in some form of structured meditation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2423" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/170033293.jpg" alt="Yoga at Nepal's Boudnath Stupa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Adherents of meditation suggest that we sit very quietly, in a particular bodily position, and strive, through a variety of exercises, to<em> empty</em> our minds of content, quite literally to push or draw away the disturbing and unfocused objects of consciousness to the periphery of our minds, leaving a central space empty and serene. In the Buddhist world-view, anxieties and excitements are not trying to tell us anything especially interesting or valuable. We continuously fret without good purpose, about this or that random and vain thing – and therefore the best solution is simply to push the objects of the mind to one side.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2424" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Meditation3c.jpg" alt="Obit Philip Seymour Hoffman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Eastern Meditation: the mind being emptied of its confused content</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Buddhist meditation has been so successful, we are liable to forget another effective and in some ways superior path to finding peace of mind, this one rooted in the Western tradition: Philosophical Meditation. Like its Eastern counterpart, Philosophical Meditation wants our thoughts, feelings and anxieties to trouble us less, but it seeks to sort out our minds in a very different manner. At heart, it doesn’t believe that the contents of our minds are nonsensical or meaningless. Our worries may seem like a nuisance but they are in fact neurotically garbled but important signals about how we should direct our lives. They contain complex clues as to our development. Therefore, rather than wanting simply to <em>empty</em> our minds of content, practitioners of Philosophical Meditation encourage us to<em> clean</em> these minds up: they want to bring the content that troubles us more securely into focus, and thereby usher in calm through understanding rather than through evacuation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2425" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Self-analysis31.jpg" alt="Obit Philip Seymour Hoffman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Western Meditation: the mind’s confused objects being brought into focus</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How does one bring the confused objects of the mind into focus? There are instructions for Philosophical Meditation, just as there are for Buddhist Meditation (a little artificiality in these matters may just be what we need to lend the process discipline). The first priority is to set aside a bit of time, ideally 20 minutes, once a day. One should sit with a pad of paper and start by asking oneself a very simple set of questions: what is it that I am <em>regretful, anxious</em> or <em>excited</em> about at present? One is invited to download the immediate contents of one’s mind. One will by nature be a little unsure of what our feelings mean, so it is best simply to write down – without thinking or censoring ourselves – one or two words around each feeling. It’s a case of tipping out the contents of the mind onto the paper as unselfconsciously as possible. One might, for example, write down: Darren, Cologne trip, weekend, shoes, Mum, face at train station… The task is then to try to convert each of these words from an ambiguous and silent worry, regret or thrill into something one can understand, grasp, order and eventually better control. Success in this meditation relies on a skilful process of questioning. Imagine these thoughts as ineloquent and muddled strangers, who are full of valuable ideas, but whom one has to get to know in a roundabout way, by directing just the right questions at them.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophical Meditation brings us calm not by removing issues, so much as by helping us to understand them, thereby evaporating some of the paranoia and static that might otherwise cling to them. When confused objects of consciousness become clearer, they stop bothering us quite so much. Problems don’t disappear, but they assume proportion and can be managed. For example, we may make ourselves at home with an array of administrative worries that had been clumsily concealed under the vague title of ‘the Cologne trip’. The word ‘Darren’ might disclose someone we envy, but who holds out a fascinating run of clues as to how we might make a new move in our career. The word ‘weekend’ yields feelings towards one’s partner which are both resentful and yet capable of being discussed and perhaps worked through in the evening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sorting out our minds doesn’t just feel comforting (like tidying our homes), it also spares us grave errors. Confused excitement can be highly dangerous when it involves career ambitions. Imagine someone with a tendency to experience excitement when reading <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Gourmet Traveller</em> – and who then declares, without much attempt to analyse the feeling, that they want ‘to work in magazines’. It may seem reasonable enough for them to send off a CV to the magazine company HQ. After many efforts, they may be offered a lowly internship. It might take a few years and a lot of heartache before they realise that it wasn’t really the magazines themselves that were the true object of their attraction to begin with. Actually what was really speaking to this person was the idea of working in a close-knit team in an area that wasn’t finance (where Mum, a caustic and forbidding figure, puritanical in matters of sex and money, spent her career). Philosophical Meditation can, among other things, save us a lot of time.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not thinking might land you up here</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Similar dangers play out when one is upset or anxious. Imagine that yesterday, you had dinner at the house of a conspicuously successful friend. They’d just got back from a holiday in the Maldives and were telling you about their latest business venture in pharmaceuticals. You left feeling restless and annoyed, but you didn’t know why. Your own life felt flat and dispiriting. Vague plans about what to do swirled around in your head. Maybe you could have a brilliant idea and start a business. Somehow you wanted your life to be more like your friend’s. But what is a brilliant idea in business? How does one get going? Then your partner said something about having set up a dinner with her mother. At that moment, from somewhere mysterious in you, you felt a wave of anger – and shouted something about the house always being left in such a mess. After all, there was a set of dirty plates in your field of vision. But your partner said you were crazy, the house wasn’t that messy anyway, and how long would it take to tidy away a few plates in the first place…? She walked out of the room crossly and so tonight, you’ll be sleeping on the sofa again for a whole set of reasons that it’s now becoming very hard to disentangle, let alone discuss with any degree of maturity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our confused inner experiences. We pick the wrong job; get together with the wrong person, run away from the right person; spend our money on the wrong things and don’t do justice to our talents and deeper aspirations. Acting without Philosophical Meditation is like being allowed to embark on a trip without checking the equipment or the map. We trust the feelings without duly acknowledging that they may prompt us in some catastrophic directions.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2427" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/174570022.jpg" alt="Ordination of 13,000 novices at Wat Phra Dhammakaya - a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The longing to<em> empty</em> the mind, to calm turbulent thoughts isn’t completely opposed to the exercise of <em>cleaning up</em> the mind, decoding, analysing and ordering its contents. It’s just that at the moment, as societies, we have allowed ourselves to get overly seduced by the promise of tranquility, so that we always strive to empty the mind, instead of attempting to understand its contents. We see our agitation as the result of thinking too much, rather than of not having – as yet – thought enough. It’s time for our societies to take on board the promises and advantages of Philosophical Meditation.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong>An Introduction to Philosophical Meditation</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2432" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/990px-Sanzio_01.jpg?resize=406%2C315" alt="990px-Sanzio_01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Once a day, clear a 20 minute stretch of time. Sit comfortably with pen and paper. Ask yourself three initial questions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">i. what am I currently upset about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ii. what am I currently anxious about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">iii. what am I currently curious or excited about?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You’re likely to be able to jot down a few things under each of these categories, but keep the answer deliberately unprocessed, just a word or so, as vague as it is likely to be in its raw form. Your list will be incomprehensible to anyone else. It might read: ‘biscuits, Chinese woman, 10.30, TBOL, food’ or ‘Mother, invoice, Seoul, Luke, trees in wind’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. You’re likely to have between two to three words under each of the three categories: Upset, Anxiety, Excitement (the mind can’t properly hold too much at any one time, even in its darker reaches).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Drill systematically into each category (Upset, Anxiety, Excitement) using the questions below.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Direct the following questions/directions at each of your ‘words’ in turn:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no need to answer all the questions. They won’t all be relevant. They are prompts and might prompt other questions in you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR UPSET:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By ‘upset’, one means: minor and major hurts from people or situations. An unkind word, a slight, a feeling of envy, a sense of abandonment… The theory is that we often don’t allow ourselves to analyse our hurts from a misplaced sense of stoicism and bravery. We pay for this dearly, for undigested hurts generate bitterness, confusion and misdirected aggression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Retell yourself the upsetting incident in great detail as if you were telling it to an extremely kind and patient friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What scared you about the incident?</span></p>
<p class="p1">- You’ve been hurt. It’s normal to be hurt. How have you been hurt?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What good part of yourself feels in danger?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How might a nice person have ended up doing what this person did to you? If they weren’t actively mean, what other explanations could there be for the hurt they have caused?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this were to carry on, what might be the catastrophe?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What are you afraid might happen if this were to continue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Have you been affected like this before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If you had to pin down an incident in the past that this somehow reminds you of, what would it be? Is there a pattern here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this had happened to a friend, how would you advise them?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What might you be able to learn from this upset?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR ANXIETY:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is a garbled signal about what a part of us perceives as a danger. It both asks for worry while not clearly revealing the roots of its concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Tell the story of the coming anxious period in great detail and say exactly what you imagine might go wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What would happen to you if it all went wrong?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing were to keeping getting worse, then ….</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- The danger here is that…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How might you still be OK, even if it was all absolutely terrible?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- How would the person you’d like to be ideally deal with this situation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What previous situation does this remind you of? Have you been in something like this before?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What happened in the past?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What helped in the past</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">QUESTIONS FOR EXCITEMENT:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By excitement is meant a range of positive emotions, tremors of interest, pleasing nostalgia, tentative enthusiasm, visual delight and so on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Describe your excitement as if to a sympathetic, interested friend.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- You need to change your life in certain ways: what would it be to change your life in the light of this?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- What are the good things contained here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Humans have an impulse towards growth: what call to growth is here in a garbled form?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- This exciting thing holds a clue to what is missing in my life; what might be missing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- When else have you felt something similar?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing could talk, what might it tell me?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If this thing could try to change my life, what changes might it advise?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- If other parts of my life were more like this, what might they be like?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Answering these questions can’t necessarily remove troubles but they start the work of decoding the scrambled messages. They reduce anxiety (rather than guarantee utter tranquility); they increase clarity – rather than promise instant enlightenment.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Nowadays, almost all of us wish we could be calmer. It’s one of the distinctive longings of the modern age. Across history, people have tended to seek out adventure and excitement. But most of us have had a bit too much of that now. The desire to be more tranquil and focused is the new, ever more urgent priority.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4063" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1.jpg?resize=499%2C358" alt="14426528187_b6ca97e94f_k1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In our view, there are eight basic causes of agitation – and the path to greater calm involves attempting to consider each one systematically and returning to it on a regular basis. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">One: Panic about Panic</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of agitation is caused by an unrealistic sense of how unusual difficulty is. We are oppressed by unhelpful images of how easy it is to achieve and how normal it is to succeed. The stories that officially circulate about what relationships and careers are like tend fatally to downplay the darker realities, leaving many of us not only upset, but upset that we are upset, feeling persecuted as well as miserable.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2933" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109088579.jpg?resize=396%2C264" alt="Skiing Couples Wed Atop Colorado's Loveland Ski Area" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">If your life is rather more difficult than this saccharine image, it must be that you are a freak or a failure</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to change our points of reference about what life is like. We need – in the broadest sense – better art, a kind that takes us more truthfully into the realities of relationships, the workplace and our 3am panics. We need to make sure we are surrounded by accurate case studies of the ordinary miseries of daily life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2934" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmC.jpg" alt="PM-170314-calmC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The Agony in the Kitchen, Jessica Todd Harper, 2012</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Consider this helpfully realistic picture of the life of a couple. Many things are going well for them. Earlier one of their children showed them such a sweet drawing she’d done at school. They had a nice holiday last year. They love playing soccer together in the park (the mum gets really competitive and has discovered she’s a brilliant goalkeeper). They are trying to work out whether to move to a village outside the city. Sometimes they feel so close. But this evening is a nightmare. She received a flirtatious email from an ex-boyfriend of years ago; she hasn’t shown it to her husband, but it’s on her mind as a source of torment. It’s opened up imaginative possibilities. She has put her head in her hands – but he’s said twenty times that drives him nuts. His mother used to do that. Their marriage is OK. They’ve been together nine years. They’re going to survive long-term, but right now, they’re about to have a titanic fight. He’ll call her a bitch and slam the door, but he’s quite nice – genuinely…</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should contemplate this image to reduce panic about our relationships. Difficulty is normal. Very decent couples have long-running and extraordinarily vicious conflicts over apparently small things. In a good relationship, two nights out of five you will wonder what you are doing together. That is success. It’s worth repeating: two bad nights a week is lucky.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The French 18th-century philosopher Chamfort wisely observed: ‘A person should swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more revolting in the day ahead.’ Disgusting things are on the menu for all of us. Life, it seems, is – in many ways – about quite a lot of suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4069" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmD1.jpg?resize=635%2C527" alt="A 4158" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Look at this image by the Spanish painter Velázquez. Christianity is upfront about the idea that our lives will be burdened by suffering. You don’t have to believe in the religion (we don’t) to recognise there’s something important at play here. Christianity takes the view that loss, self-reproach, failure, regret, sickness and sadness will always find ways of entering life. Our troubles need practical help, of course. But Christianity identifies another need as well: for our suffering to be recognised as normal.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This picture of the Crucifixion universalises suffering. The painter shows a good – indeed perfect – man being humiliated, injured and ultimately killed. He invites us to contemplate the centrality of suffering in the achievement of all valuable goals. Rather than concentrate on the moment of fulfilment – when one feels the joy of success – he directs our attention to the times of hardship and sacrifice and says they are the most important, the most deserving of admiration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Such dark images strengthen us a little – and offer valuable consolation – for the hard tasks of our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Taking too much responsibility</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We over-personalise our fates, taking too much credit in the good times, and then, too much blame in the bad ones.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s tempting to take all the credit when there is a triumph. But the corollary is that we are entirely to blame when we are humiliated and beaten.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2939" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmE.jpg?resize=487%2C352" alt="The New York Stock Exchange during the global banking crisis, America - 10 Oct 2008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are particularly prone to over-personalisation when it comes to money. To keep our agitation in check we should embrace an economic perspective that allows us to see ourselves as operating within a huge system loosely designated as ‘Capitalism’. Regular contemplation of an image of the New York Stock Exchange reminds us that the way the world works is not our own doing. Powerful forces sweep over whole industries, condemning some to decline, while raising others to remarkable (if unstable) prosperity. The key point is: much about your fate is not your own work. You did not invent the world. You are not personally entirely responsible for your condition. The suffering is real, but remember that it is less personal than we tend to suppose.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmF.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4067" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmF.jpg?resize=417%2C373" alt="PM-170314-calmF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is a statue of the Roman goddess of Fortune. The Romans knew her as ‘Fortuna’. She was to be found on the back of most Roman coins, holding a cornucopia in one hand and a rudder in the other. She was beautiful and usually wore a light tunic and smiled attractively. The cornucopia was a symbol of her power to bestow favours, but the rudder was a symbol of her more sinister power to change destinies, just like that. She could scatter gifts (a love affair, a great job, beautiful children), then with terrifying speed shift the rudder’s course, maintaining a chilling smile as she watched us choke to death on a fishbone, disappear in a landslide or go bankrupt in a credit crisis.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The goddess of Fortune remains a useful image to keep our exposure to accident, luck and fate continually in our minds; she conflates a range of threats to our security into one ghastly anthropomorphic enemy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Not everything that happens to us occurs with reference to something about us. Our romantic or professional failure does not have to be read as retribution for some sin we have committed, it is not always rational punishment handed out after careful examination of all the evidence by an all-seeing Providence in a divine courtroom; it may be a cruel, but morally meaningless, byproduct of the machinations of a rancorous goddess. The interventions of Fortune, of ‘luck’, whether they are kindly or diabolical, introduce a random element into human destiny.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To be calm, we must reduce the weight of our proud and unrealistic modern individualism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Being too Hopeful</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A major source of agitation is, strange as it might at first sound, optimism. The expectation that things will go well creates anxiety because, at some level, we know that we can’t quite count on our hopes coming to fruition. And of course, as things turn out, quite often they don’t. We are on tenterhooks – and we suffer.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">To restore calm we need to become strategically pessimistic. That is, to spend more time getting used to the very real possibility that things will work out rather badly. A lot of good projects fail, most things go wrong, at least half our dreams won’t work out. Pessimism dampens unhelpful and impatient expectations.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is hope – with regard to our careers, our love lives, our children, our politicians and our planet – that is primarily to blame for angering and embittering us. The incompatibility between the scale of our aspirations and the reality of life generates the anxious disappointments which spoil so many days.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are some extremely helpful pessimists in the history of philosophy, waiting to cheer us up. The French philosopher Blaise Pascal stands out for the exceptionally therapeutic nature of his gloom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmG.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4071" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-170314-calmG.jpg?resize=635%2C473" alt="PM-170314-calmG" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In his book, the <em>Pensées</em>, Pascal misses no opportunities to confront his readers with evidence of how badly things normally turn out. In seductive classical French, he informs us that happiness is an illusion (‘Anyone who does not see the vanity of the world is very vain himself’), that misery is the norm (‘If our condition were truly happy we should not need to divert ourselves from thinking about it’) and that we have to face the desperate facts of our situation head on: ‘Man’s greatness comes from knowing he is wretched’.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Given the tone, it comes as something of a surprise to discover that reading Pascal is not at all the depressing experience one might have presumed. The work is consoling, heartwarming and even, at times, hilarious. For those teetering on the verge of despair, there can paradoxically be no finer book to turn to than one which seeks to grind man’s every last hope into the dust. The Pensées, far more than any sentimental volume touting inner beauty, positive thinking or the realisation of hidden potential, has the power to coax the suicidal off the ledge of a high parapet.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There is relief, which can explode into bursts of laughter, when we finally come across evidence that our very worst insights, far from being unique and shameful, are part of the common, inevitable reality of mankind. Our dread that we might be the only ones to feel anxious, bored, jealous, cruel, perverse and narcissistic turns out to be gloriously unfounded, opening up unexpected opportunities for communion around our dark realities.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should honour Pascal, and the long line of pessimistic philosophers to which he belongs, for doing us the incalculably great favour of publicly and elegantly rehearsing the facts of life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is not a stance with which the modern world betrays much sympathy, for one of its dominant characteristics, and certainly its greatest flaw, is its optimism.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Despite occasional moments of panic, most often connected to market crises, wars or pandemics, the secular age maintains an all but irrational devotion to a narrative of improvement, based on a messianic faith in the three great drivers of change: science, technology and business. Material improvements since the mid-18th century have been so remarkable, and have so exponentially increased our comfort, safety, wealth and power, as to deal an almost fatal blow to our capacity to remain pessimistic – and therefore, crucially, to our ability to stay calm. It has been impossible to hold on to a balanced assessment of what life is likely to provide for us when we have witnessed the cracking of the genetic code, the invention of the mobile phone, the opening of Western-style supermarkets in remote corners of China and the launch of the Hubble telescope.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2943" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmH.jpg?resize=497%2C328" alt="The Wolf of Wall Street - 24 Oct 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yet while it is undeniable that the scientific and economic trajectories of mankind have been pointed firmly in an upward direction for several centuries, we do not comprise mankind: none of us individuals can dwell exclusively amidst the ground-breaking developments in genetics or telecommunications that lend our age its distinctive and buoyant prejudices. We may derive some benefit from the availability of hot baths and computer chips, but our lives are no less subject to accident, frustrated ambition, heartbreak, jealousy, anxiety or death than were those of our medieval forebears. But at least our ancestors had the advantage of living in pessimistic times which never made the mistake of promising its population that happiness could ever make a permanent home for itself on this earth.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2944" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-170314-calmI.jpg" alt="PM-170314-calmI" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It’s worth adding that a pessimistic worldview does not have to entail a life stripped of joy. Pessimists can have a far greater capacity for appreciation than optimists, for they never expect things to turn out well and so may be amazed by the modest successes which occasionally break across their darkened horizons. It’s quite possible to be both pessimistic and, day to day, a real laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: We don’t know what we are bothered about</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">We don’t like admitting it but quite often we don’t really know what it is that has caused us to get so agitated. It can feel like an insult: we are upset and we don’t know why. But really it is a helpful thought. Finding out the real cause is the key to bringing relief: unanalysed frustration is the root cause of rage; we need to work on repatriating our emotions.</p>
<p class="p1">Let&#8217;s imagine an explosion of annoyance of the dishwasher being left in a mess by one&#8217;s partner. One starts to shout at them, complaining all the time of &#8216;the chaos.&#8217;</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2954" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmA.jpg?resize=482%2C361" alt="How not to load a dishwasher." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<p class="p1">But though one&#8217;s anger has locked on to the state of the dishwasher, perhaps the root cause lies elsewhere, for example, in a tense situation at work, or in an unresolved discussion about sex from the night before.</p>
<p class="p1">The way to calm is through analysis. We need to spend time on self-knowledge. We have to try to isolate the genuine cause, which might lie quite far from the surface eruption. The pursuit of calm isn’t about making every single moment perfectly tranquil. It&#8217;s to prevent agitation turning into catastrophe &#8211; which involves a constant effort to take apart moods of anxiety in order to pinpoint their real causes.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Capitalism and False Glamour</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is inbuilt in capitalism that the best things in life cannot be the free ones. On the contrary, capitalism is keen to tell us things which are inexpensive cannot be much good and that everything worth having costs a lot of money – more than you have.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a profound cause of lack of calm in our lives. It means that we are continually agitated by the worry that we can’t afford the things that will make us happy. It’s a very understandable anxiety. But it is unhelpful – and based on a falsehood. We need to remind ourselves – on a regular basis – that inexpensive, simple things may often have much more to offer us. Ideally, a large part of modern culture would support us in that calming endeavour. But, for the moment, it is something we have to do for ourselves, with the assistance of some impressive allies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2958" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmC.jpg" alt="PM-180314-calmC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This beautiful bowl is telling us a helpful thing: that things that are precious in their meaning and visual appeal needn’t be financially precious – and this is very good news in a world where hardly anyone has lots of money. It is one strand of how we can deal better with consumerism, disrupting the linear relationship between expense and goodness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though this particular bowl is in an art gallery – and would cost a fortune to buy – it’s not much different (and certainly no better) than one we might pick up cheaply in Ikea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2959" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-180314-calmD.jpg?resize=498%2C553" alt="PM-180314-calmD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the heroes of appreciating the real worth of simple, inexpensive things is the 18th-century French painter Jean-Siméon Chardin</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Everything here is simple and modest. And wonderful. Someone preserved the apricots last autumn. It didn’t cost much to do that – at least not in financial terms; what it took was care and patience. The wine glass on the left wasn’t expensive – but the design is just right. The cup is pretty, and adds a cheerful touch of colour. Most junk shops have a few quite like it. The package on the right has been tied with style, but brown paper and string won’t break the bank. The knife is second hand; it’s got a nice handle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Chinese bowl and the painting are helpful correctives to the pressure of glamour – which tries to push us in the opposite direction, making us feel we can’t love our lives unless we are doing the fashionable, expensive thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The media is constantly defining the good life in a way that makes it inaccessible to most people. This is extremely unhelpful and untrue, for it turns out that – more wisely considered – many lovely things are, in fact, within our reach. A capacity for appreciation, not money, is the key to a certain kind of calm.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Six: The Promotion of Kindness</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1">Fear of humiliation is a fundamental cause of anxiety. And it is based on our assumptions of how other people will react to us in difficult situations. The worry – of course – is that they will be harsh and mean. Our failings and imperfections will be met with mockery or indifference.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2967" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmA.jpg" alt="Football/Everton Investors" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A lot of our agitation stems from the fear of the nastiness of others. So a world in which people are nicer is going to be helpful in a very particular way: it will reduce the fear of failure and humiliation.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This realisation takes some of the weight off ourselves. Anxiety about appearance need not be vanity – and hence something that we should berate ourselves for. In fact it is usually caused by the readiness of others to judge on appearances. Worries about status are not the product of our own shallow and crude materialism. They are the logical response to the way in which decent treatment is unfairly handed out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">People who might belittle you for actually unimportant reasons are, themselves, fraught with insecurity. They threaten to attack because they are so fearful that others will mock them. The promotion of kindness lessens the level of fear of others which circulates in society.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Perspective in Space</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We naturally exaggerate our own importance. The incidents of our own lives loom very large in our view of the world. Yet, really, we are minute and entirely dispensable. The world would trundle on much the same without us. It is very helpful to be reduced, from time to time, in our own eyes because this calms the urgent, disturbing (and very normal) sense that it really, really matters what we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2969" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmB.jpg" alt="Somerset night sky" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">On an evening walk you look up and see the the planets Venus and Jupiter shining in the darkening sky. If the dusk deepens you might see some stars – Aldebaran, Andromeda, Aries and many others. It’s a hint of the unimaginable extensions of space across the solar system, the galaxy, the cosmos. The sight has a calming effect. Because none of our troubles, disappointments or hopes have any relevance. Everything that happens to us, or that we do, is of no consequence whatever from the point of view of the universe. For a little while our own lives seem unimportant. But it is not a personal affront. The same applies to everyone: it is levelling, humbling.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">A related benefit can be drawn from the contemplation of life going on in places far from where we are. If you don’t happen to live in the vicinity, you might be soothed by news from Puerto Montt in Chile.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2970" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmC.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">Puerto Montt</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It lies on the Pacific coast, a two hour flight south of the capital, Santiago. It has a population of 155,000. The weather is mild all year round, though it occasionally freezes in winter. The salmon breeding industry has not been doing well there in recent years. The local soccer team, Deportes, plays in the national Segunda División (they finished seventh last season). There’s a large Unimarc shopping centre near the bus terminal. A bayside restaurant, La Kosina Folkbar, has an excellent reputation for fish and steak.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-190314-calmD.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4074" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-190314-calmD.jpg?resize=465%2C398" alt="PM-190314-calmD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p2"><span class="s1">The menu today at La Kosina Folkbar</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">And the people of Puerto Montt, of course, might benefit from contemplating the minor, daily events of the South London suburb of Norwood, or Newark in Delaware, or the Nerima district of Tokyo.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2972" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmE.jpg" alt="Japan - 2010" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">A soothing image – for the residents of Puerto Montt</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It is, essentially, a reminder that life can be lived perfectly well in ways that are quite different from our own. The resentments, longings and ambitions which agitate our days might have very little meaning elsewhere. The totems of local status become ridiculous when seen on a global scale. Sending one’s children to Kambala High School obsesses some parents in Sydney, but has zero cachet in Patagonia. A resident of Glasgow might fret for years paying a big mortgage for the privilege of living in Milngavie. Yet, from a distance, this suburb has no status at all.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We need to be reminded of how little weight our concerns would have when seen from almost anywhere else, for the kindly reason of reducing our anxiety and helping us feel a little calmer about our lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Eight: Perspective in Time</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">While the tower of this church in the tiny village of Helmingham was being built, Columbus reached the Caribbean. Stone masons climbed ladders to shape the upper windows while Leonardo da Vinci was experimenting with flying vehicles. Carpenters fitted the beams on the roof as Granada, the last Muslim stronghold in Spain, fell. To spend time there is to be reminded – in a very touching and helpful way – of how tiny our existence is in the larger fabric of history.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2973" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-190314-calmF.jpg" alt="PM-190314-calmF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as the expanses of space and geography offer a valuable perspective that takes us out of our local preoccupations, so too the encounter with things that are very old can have a moderating, tranquilising effect.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We should regularly seek out places that speak to us of the extended passage of time. But it’s not enough merely to be in the place. It’s important to actively consider the scale of history, to make oneself think of how much has happened, of how the world has changed. And from there, one is better placed to return to the unavoidable demands of the present.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Distressing levels of agitation are normal. The pursuit of calm is not a way of avoiding engagement with the challenging and difficult parts of existence. An ideal society would systematically calm us down by installing the eight strategies we have discussed over the past few days. Until then, we have to take responsibility for ourselves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s far into the night, but sleep won’t come. You turn over. Perhaps a different position will quieten the mind. Or maybe the other side was better after all. Panic sets in. Not sleeping is a disaster.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For very understandable reasons our culture has arrived at extremely negative assessments of insomnia. It is a curse, to be overcome by art or science, by a sleeping pill, chamomile tea or sheep counting.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2460" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070414-insomniaA.jpg?resize=547%2C365" alt="PM-070414-insomniaA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being unable to sleep night after night, for weeks on end, is – of course – hell. But in smaller doses, insomnia does not need a cure. Occasional sleeplessness is an asset, a help with some key troubles of the soul. Crucial things we need may only get a chance to happen during a few active hours in the middle of the night. We should revise our assessment of sleeplessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4076" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaB.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="PM-070414-insomniaB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Out of bed in the middle of the night … raising the prestige of not being able to sleep</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Danish painter Kersting hints at the virtues of the sleepless state. We can guess it’s very late; more conventional people have long ago turned in, but the man has stayed up, to read, to think, to talk with a long-forgotten person: himself. Late at night is when big things may at last have a chance to happen in the mind. Like all the most interesting artists, Kersting is trying to make what really matters glamorous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the day, we are dutiful to others. At night we return to a bigger duty: to ourselves. Night is a corrective to the demands of the community. </span>I may be a dentist or a maths teacher but, long before that happened and still now when I am allowed to commune with myself, I am simply a nameless, limitless consciousness, a far more expansive, un-anchored figure, of infinite possibilities and rare, disturbing, ambivalent, peculiar, visionary insights.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The thoughts of night would sound weird to my mother, my friend, my boss, my child. These people need us to be a certain way. They cannot tolerate all our possibilities and for some good reasons. We don’t want to let them down; they have a right to benefit from our predictability. But their expectations shape us, make us who we are, and choke off important aspects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at night, with the window open and a clear sky above, it is just us and the universe – and for a time, we can take on a little of its boundlessness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2465" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-070414-insomniaD.jpg" alt="PM-070414-insomniaD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">5 a.m. Free, until the first person she knows wakes up…</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We don’t only suffer from spending insufficient time with our true deep selves. We also suffer because we are presented only with the daytime version of other people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to have a lot more portraits of what people are like when they are alone, in the dim hours, and their heads are filled with odd (but so normal) thoughts. At two in the morning, the CEO thinks the company is futile – and yet she remains a good CEO. A mother thinks about walking out of her marriage and her family – and yet she will stay and no one need know. A successful novelist wishes he’d never started writing, feels everything he has done is pitiful. And yet he remains an insightful, consoling wordsmith. We need to know that people who are competent, capable and decent will also have (in the privacy of the night) thoughts which are deeply contrary to who we imagine them to be.  Far from being disconcerting, this is properly consoling; a corrective to our debilitating sense of isolation and private madness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s often been assumed that if you draw off the social pressure to be decent and responsible, monstrous parts of the self will emerge.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaE1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4993" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaE1.jpg?resize=635%2C491" alt="PM-070414-insomniaE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Goya: when we let go of our public identity we are revealed as monsters of selfishness and cruelty</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet, social pressure is perhaps also keeping back sweet and delicate aspects of ourselves. We keep them under wraps during the day not because they are so awful, but because they are so liable to be misunderstood.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4991" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-070414-insomniaF.jpg?resize=635%2C486" alt="PM-070414-insomniaF" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">We can be rather strange and lonely – together</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Late at night is when the bully recognises that he is cruel from anger and disappointment and that deep down, he is lonely and ashamed. A readiness to admit weakness, error and confusion, a readiness to be ashamed and to be sorry – these are not qualities encouraged by the bright, defensive brittleness of day. Only at night, without fear of consequence or humiliation, we start to regrow the more delicate aspects of our natures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are naturally very inclined to want to be normal. Yet thanks to insomnia, we are granted a crucial encounter with our weirder, truer selves. We can learn of our own apparent strangeness. The daytime self is a misleading picture of what everyone is like. Insomnia is a gift – and a latent education.</span></p>
<p class="p1">                                                                                          ***</p>
<p class="p1">Insomnia may also provide the perfect occasion on which to think. It’s easy to forget how little strategic thinking ever gets done in the day. Judging by the ideas generated there, our beds have more of a right to be called our offices than our offices. Insomnia is the revenge of the many big thoughts one hasn’t had time to nurture in the daylight hours.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2476" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rushhour.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">8.42am: not a good time for asking the big why questions</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">During the day, there are a thousand immediate issues to be sorted out. Our minds are dominated by what one could call lower-order questions: what’s the fastest way to get to the meeting in the city centre? How can I get the phone number of the restaurant to book a table for Thursday? What do I say to win the argument with my partner?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AristotleRaphael.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4083" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AristotleRaphael.jpg?resize=429%2C353" alt="AristotleRaphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the start of his ‘Ethics’, Aristotle points out that most of what we do is for the sake of something else. Someone makes a harness – to take his favourite example – so that a horse can be controlled.  That means the cavalry can be more effective. So the general can win the battle. So the statesman can win the war. So the good society can be safe. Therefore, the lower-order activity, like making the harness, can ideally be understood as serving, at a distance, a higher-order concern – like maintaining a good society.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Philosophy, according to Aristotle, should be focused on the higher-order questions. It doesn’t focus on HOW to do things, so much as on WHY they might be worth doing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the rush of the day, there is no time for the higher-order questions: why do I waste my time with superficial social encounters? Why do I read the newspaper? Why was I so irrationally irritated with the person I profess to love?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At night, however, the ranking of first and second order questions is reversed. In the dark, one may investigate the meaning of work, the needs behind friendship, the mechanics of love. The topics are far from academic. We become philosophers when we chase the practical issues upstream.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RodinPenseur.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4085" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/RodinPenseur.jpg?resize=635%2C399" alt="RodinPenseur" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The posture is misleading: we’re far more likely to get thinking when lying down in the dark</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s very often ambitions that keep us awake. What am I really trying to do? What’s my life for? We sense and are tormented by our possibilities: how does one make more money, how can one be more effective, how can one make a difference…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">These questions are terrifying because, at first, there tends to be no plan of action, simply an ambition waiting to be knocked down by the scepticism and mockery of others. To be turning over such issues and yet be a mere beginner feels like the ultimate arrogance. That is why one needs the protection of the night. Night offers us safety from the scepticism of sensible others. Like childhood, it allows us time to get ourselves together without needing to be always sure or impressive.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2481" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/corbusier.jpg" alt="corbusier" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The architect Le Corbusier’s first sketch of an apartment building for a Parisian street, completed – like a lot of his work – late at night, in bed</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the middle of the night, you don’t have to make your case to a hostile audience. You can run with an idea that, to others, right now, would look feeble.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ulysses.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4087" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Ulysses.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="Ulysses" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">An early draft of Ulysses; James Joyce kept getting it wrong. But he kept going – almost always late at night</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the most poignant things about artists is their endless capacity for sticking with quite bad, early versions of ideas. The finished, printed pages of James Joyce’s masterpiece Ulysses give no hint of the process by which they were produced. But the manuscript drafts do. We can see the crossed out sentences and paragraphs, the words that had to be shunted about, the passages that just didn’t work.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being an artist always involves taking risks with serious imperfection; it means forgiving oneself for the horrors of the first, second and third drafts. In this particular sense, all of us should be artists: not of novels or buildings but of projects in our own lives. We need to keep faith with our goals without choking with disgust at our clumsy early manoeuvres.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What is true of art is true of life more generally. To successfully pull off a new business or an office reorganisation has much in common with the production of a novel or an apartment building. Lying in bed, as a delivery lorry trundles along a distant dual carriageway or a car door slams eerily somewhere along the street, we have to risk thinking through the first very, very imperfect version of a large plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Schiller.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4089" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Schiller.jpg?resize=635%2C432" alt="Schiller" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The German writer and philosopher Friedrich Schiller believed in ‘withdrawing the watchers from the gate’. To be more creative, he suggested that we need to let our stranger, slightly crazy ideas get a hearing. We must not reject too soon. Later comes the business of selecting, ordering and polishing. But creativity involves being unusually willing to entertain the ridiculous and the fragmentary.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We want to arrive, eventually, at a feasible, defensible strategy. But we all have to start with thoughts that look extremely unimpressive and possibly absurd. Night is a friend to the slow process of maturation that every ambitious project demands: it provides us with the cover to grow into our more complete selves.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It really matters what we think of as ‘being normal,&#8217; because we are collective creatures. We&#8217;re acutely receptive to group dynamics and sensitive to where we fit in – or the ways in which we don’t. No matter how much we praise individualism and see ourselves as unique we are, in fact, deeply influenced by our picture of what is &#8216;normal&#8217; in our society.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.caltrate.co.za/files/images/everybody%20needs%20calcium.jpg?resize=494%2C329" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a problem because our picture of what is normal is in fact &#8211; very often &#8211; way, way out of line with what is actually true and widespread. Many things that we might assume are uniquely odd or disconcertingly strange – and which cut us off from other people – are in fact completely average and ubiquitous: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">If you … </span></strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- sense you’ve married the wrong person</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- get sick with envy when a friend succeeds</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- think about your partner&#8217;s sister in bed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- want to cry when anyone criticises you</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- dislike the way you look</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3489639831_78b2f8ce7c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6146" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3489639831_78b2f8ce7c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3489639831_78b2f8ce7c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- panic at the thought of having a conversation with a stranger</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- worry a great deal about farting in public</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- feel you might vomit in a meeting out of fear</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- can’t sleep well in hotels</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- find that your voice starts to give way or crack when you have to speak to anyone important</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- are worried about sitting on a dirty toilet seat</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- trip over tiny cracks in the pavement</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- have sexual thoughts about members of your own family</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- bump your head trying to get nonchalantly into a taxi</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- are turned on by some pretty weird people in the news, like the president of Russia</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PutinKabaeva.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6147" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/PutinKabaeva.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="PutinKabaeva" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- masturbate a lot</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- regard yourself as a fraud</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- worry about not making it to the toilet in time</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- walk into doors, lampposts, car wing mirrors and bollards</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- often worry that other people can see your genitals</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- are gripped by the fear you will by mistake spit on your dining companion in a restaurant</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- fear other people think you’re a pervert</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- still think about a relationship that ended badly eleven years ago</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">…. then you can quietly congratulate yourself: <em><strong>you are deeply normal.</strong></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The picture of normality has been drawn, in our culture, by slightly brutish characters. It’s not simply that the picture has tended to stress externals over internals: suggesting to us that it’s normal to have a gleaming kitchen or go on a foreign holiday every year. It’s rather that the assumptions about what it’s like to be alive, to be a human being, have been skewed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/importance-of-licing-and-dining-areas.jpg?resize=546%2C431" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our culture has tried to project an idea of an organised, poised and polished self, as the standard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>way most people are. And this encourages us to get impatient and disgusted with ourselves when we don’t live up to expectations. We want to shout that we need to buck up, get it together and stop being so weak or so weird. But instead of expecting ourselves to be normal in the sense of being calm, coherent and rational, and getting ashamed when we&#8217;re not, it’s far better to recognise the omnipresence and sheer normality of madness, waywardness and alarm in every single human soul.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our societies are very interested in winners but don’t really know what to do about losers – of which there are always, by definition, far more.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, around success and failure, the rhetoric tends to be very upbeat. We hear about resilience, bouncing back, never surrendering and giving it another go. But there’s only so long this kind of talk can go on. At some point, the conclusion becomes inevitable: things won’t work out. The political career isn’t going to have a come-back. There’ll be no way of getting finance for the film. The novel won’t be accepted by the thirty-second publisher. The criminal charges are forever going to taint one’s reputation. One’s stuffed up big time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Samuel_Beckett_Pic_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6025" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Samuel_Beckett_Pic_1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C556" alt="Samuel_Beckett,_Pic,_1 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where does responsibility for success and failure lie? Nowadays, squarely with the individual concerned. That’s why failure isn’t just hard (as it has always been), it is a catastrophe. There is no metaphysical consolation, no possibility of appealing to an idea of ‘bad luck,’ no one to blame but oneself. No wonder suicide rates climb exponentially once societies become modern and start to hold people profoundly responsible for their biographies. Meritocracies turn failure from a misfortune to an unbudgeable existential verdict on the state of one’s soul. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But not all societies and eras have seen success and failure in such a stark light. In Ancient Greece, another rather remarkable possibility – quite ignored by our own era – was envisaged: you could be good and yet fail. To keep this idea at the front of the collective imagination, the Ancient Greeks developed a particular art form: tragic drama. They put on huge festivals, at which all the citizens were expected to attend, to act out stories of appalling, often grisly, failure: people were seen to break a minor law, or make a hasty decision or sleep with the wrong person and the result was ignominy and death. Yet what happened was shown to be to a large extent in the hands of what the Greeks called ‘fate’ or ‘the Gods’. It was the Greeks’ poetic way of saying that things often work out in random ways, according to dynamics that simply don’t reflect the merits of the individuals concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/162596339.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5896" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/162596339.jpg?resize=635%2C457" alt="85th Annual Academy Awards - Show" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>The Poetics</em>, the philosopher Aristotle defined the key ingredients of tragedy. The hero of the tragedy should be a decent person: ‘better than average’, often high-born but prone to making small mistakes, as we all do. At the start, it may not be obvious that it is an error they are making. But by an unfortunate chain of events, for which they are not wholly to blame, this small mistake leads to a catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tragedy is the sympathetic, morally-complex account of how good people can end up in disastrous situations. It is the very opposite of today’s tabloid newspaper or social mediasphere, where the mob rushes to make judgements on those who have slipped up. Aristotle thought it extremely important that people see tragic works on a regular basis to counter their otherwise strong inclinations to judge and moralise. A good tragedy should, thought Aristotle, inspire both pity and fear: pity for the tragic hero based on an understanding of how easy it is to make the slip that leads to disaster; and fear for oneself as one realises how open our lives are to careering out of control. All of us could quite quickly come apart if ever events chose to test us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3304460.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5897" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3304460.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="Captive Greeks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tragedy is meant to be a corrective to easy judgement, it exists to counter our natural instincts to admire only the successful, to spurn all those who fail,  and to dismiss unfortunates as losers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re currently very uncomfortable around the idea of a good person not succeeding. We’d rather say that they weren’t good at all than embrace a far more disturbing and less well-publicised thought: that – in fact – the world is very unfair. But without the idea of tragedy, we make existence for everyone far crueller and far more judgemental than it really need be. It’s time to look back in time to recover an extremely important idea.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The term &#8216;higher consciousness&#8217; is often used by spiritually-minded people to describe important but hard-to-reach mental states.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hindu sages, Christian monks and Buddhist ascetics all speak of reaching moments of &#8216;higher consciousness&#8217; – through meditation or chanting, fasting or pilgrimages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_481693761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5807" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_481693761.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Yogi man meditating on the Ghats" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, the way in which these spiritual people discuss their states of higher consciousness has a tendency to put a lot of secular types on edge. It can all sound maddeningly vague, wishy washy, touchy-feely – and, for want of a better word, annoying. What on earth do these gurus really mean?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We deeply sympathise with such frustrations, not being by nature particularly attracted to the ineffable or the mysterious. However, it seems that the idea of higher consciousness is in fact a very interesting one, which has nothing inherently to do with spirituality and can be defined simply enough in strictly rational and secular terms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is how we see it: as human beings, we spend most of our lives functioning in states of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lower consciousness, where what we are principally concerned with is ourselves, our survival and our own success, narrowly defined.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_158697230.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5808" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_158697230.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Consumers In The Christmas Eve Retail Rush" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ordinary life rewards practical, unintrospective, self-justifying outlooks that are the hallmarks of what we could call &#8216;lower&#8217; consciousness. Neuroscientists speak of a &#8216;lower&#8217; part of the brain they term the reptilian mind and tell us that under its sway, we strike back when we&#8217;re hit, blame others, quell any stray questions that lack immediate relevance, fail to free-associate and stick closely to a flattering image of who we are and where we are heading.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at rare moments, when there are no threats or demands upon us, perhaps late at night or early in the morning, when our bodies and passions are comfortable and quiescent, we have the privilege of being able to access the higher mind – what neuroscientists call our neocortex, the seat of imagination, empathy and impartial judgement. We loosen our hold on our own egos and ascend to a less biased and more universal perspective, casting off a little of the customary anxious self-justification and brittle pride.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In such states, the mind moves beyond its particular self-interests and cravings. We start to think of other people in a more imaginative way. Rather than criticise and attack, we are free to imagine that their behaviour is driven by pressures derived from their own more primitive minds, which they are generally in no position to tell us about. Their temper or viciousness are, we now see, symptoms of hurt rather than of ‘evil’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154503892.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5810" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154503892.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="City Lofts, Dock 9, Salford Quays, Manchester" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to explain others&#8217; actions by their distress, rather than simply in terms of how it affects us. We perceive that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism or aggression, but always – when we can manage it – love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At such moments, the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort, full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others, but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty and touching vulnerability. The fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One’s own life feels less precious; one can contemplate being no longer present with tranquility. One’s interests are put aside and one may imaginatively fuse with transient or natural things: trees, the wind, a moth, clouds or waves breaking on the shore. From this point of view, status is nothing, possessions don’t matter, grievances lose their urgency. If certain people could encounter us at this point, they might be amazed at our transformation and at our newfound generosity and empathy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_176435178.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5812" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_176435178.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="Meteor Shower Over The United Kingdom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">States of higher consciousness are, of course, desperately short lived. We shouldn’t in any case aspire to make them permanent, because they don’t sit so well with the many important practical tasks we all need to attend to. But we should make the most of them when they arise, and harvest their insights for the time when we require them most.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Higher consciousness is a huge triumph over the primitive mind which cannot envisage any such possibilities. Ideally, we would be a little more alive to the advantages of this higher mind and strive to make our oceanic experiences somewhat less random and less clothed in unnecessary mystery.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To wonder too insistently what &#8216;the meaning of life&#8217; might be marks you out as being somewhat heavy, weird or just naïve.</p>
<p>People nowadays often say – sometimes in a sad way, other times more aggressively and cynically – that &#8216;life just has no meaning.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5758" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two reasons are often cited for this. The first has to do with<strong> religion</strong>. Once upon a time, so the story goes, life had a clear meaning given to us by God: it was about worshiping Him and living according to His dictates. But as religious belief has declined, not only has god supposedly died, but along with him, the meaning he once guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Modern science</strong> is the second cause of the current crisis of meaning. Scientists tell us that existence, which emerged from a random interplay of chemicals and gases, does have meaning, but it&#8217;s of a rather bleak, relentless and narrow sort: for humans – as for all other living things (like amoeba) – the meaning of life is survival and the propagation of one&#8217;s genetic material. It sounds very true and at the same time, distinctly futile and melancholy.</p>
<p>Here we want to argue as follows: to wonder about the meaning of life is an extremely important activity, life <em>does</em> have substantial meaning – and there are, in fact, a range of practical steps we can take to ensure we end up leading lives of maximal meaningfulness.</p>

<p>We should start by saying that there is no meaning in life outside of that which we can find by ourselves as a species. There isn&#8217;t any kind of objective meaning written in the stars, in a holy book or in sequences of DNA.</p>
<p>What seems to prompt people to complain that life lacks meaning are particular varieties of unhappiness. Let&#8217;s consider some central examples:</p>
<p>– You&#8217;re in a relationship, but the intensity you experienced at the start has long gone. You don&#8217;t seem to talk about anything important any more or share vulnerable feelings and ideas. It feels, as you put it, &#8216;meaningless&#8217;. Or else you&#8217;re single and, though you have many friends, every time you see them, the conversation seems shallow and trivial.</p>
<p>– You are at university studying for a degree. You signed up for the course in part because you often feel confused about who you are and what you want. You thought that reading books and going to lectures would shine a light on things, but the topics are dull and disconnected from your confusion. You complain it feels meaningless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/129033328.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5764" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/129033328.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="Universities Face Jump In Student Enrollment" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– You&#8217;re working in a large profitable company and earning a decent sum every week, but the work doesn&#8217;t seem, in the grander scheme, important. By which you mean two things: that you don&#8217;t seem to be making any great difference to anyone&#8217;s life and also that there&#8217;s no profound part of you that you&#8217;re able to bring to, or incorporate in, your work. It might as well be done by a robot.</p>
<p>From these strands, we can start to extrapolate a theory of meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning is to be found in three activities in particular: <strong>Communication, Understanding</strong> and <strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at <strong>communication</strong> first. We are, by nature, isolated creatures and it appears that some of our most meaningful moments are to do with instances of connection: with a lover, for example, when we reveal our intimate physical and psychological selves, or when we form friendships where substantial truths about our respective lives can be shared. Or on a journey to a new country, when we strike up a conversation with a stranger and feel a thrilling sense of victory over linguistic and cultural barriers. Or when we are touched by books, songs, and films that put their fingers on emotions that are deeply our own but that we had never witnessed externalized so clearly or beautifully before.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/907711071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5772" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/907711071.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Old man talking to Colin Wills of the BBC during a train journey, 1950." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the meaning that emerges via <strong>understanding</strong>. This is about the pleasure that can be felt whenever we correct confusion and puzzlement about ourselves or the world. We might be scientific researchers, or economists, poets or patients in psychotherapy; the pleasure of our activities stems from a common ability to map and make sense of what was once painfully unfamiliar and strange.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there&#8217;s<strong> service</strong>. One of the most meaningful things we can do is to serve other people, to try to improve their lives, either by alleviating sources of suffering or else by generating new sources of pleasure. So we might be working as cardiac surgeons and aware every day of the meaning of our jobs or else be in a company that&#8217;s making a modest but real difference to people&#8217;s lives by helping them get a better night&#8217;s sleep, finding their keys or thrilling them aesthetically with elegant furniture or harmonious tunes. Or else our service might be to friends or our own families, or perhaps the earth itself. We&#8217;re often told to think of ourselves as inherently selfish. But some of the most meaningful moments come when we transcend our egos and put ourselves at the service of others – or the planet. One should add that in order for service to feel meaningful, it has to be in synch with our native, sincere interests. Not everyone will find medicine or social work, ballet or graphic design meaningful. It&#8217;s a case of knowing enough about ourselves to find our particular path to service.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/146089987.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5766" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/146089987.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Spain Continues To Struggle With The Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Armed with such ideas, we can move towards defining nothing less than the meaning of life. The meaning of life is to pursue human flourishing through communication, understanding and service.</p>
<p>In order to have meaningful lives, we can also see that certain things will need to be in play.</p>
<p>We need to have relationships with others: not necessarily romantic ones (that&#8217;s been way overdone in our society), but connections of some kind where the important things are shared. It might, of course, be relationships with books or songs.</p>
<p>We also need to have a culture conducive to fostering an understanding of oneself and the world. The enemies of this include being surrounded by mass media that throws out chaotic information or an academic environment that promotes dead, sterile investigations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/135830920.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5769" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/135830920.jpg?resize=635%2C320" alt="A customer stands next to the TV screens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And lastly we need to have good work, which means a world filled with businesses and organisations geared towards not just profit, but the assistance and genuine improvement of human kind. In addition, we need to help people to discover their own particular inner &#8216;tune&#8217; that they can put into their work, so that people aren&#8217;t just serving per se, but serving in a way that taps into their heartfelt interests.</p>
<p>There are, sadly, a lot of obstacles to meaningful lives. In the area of communication: it&#8217;s things like an over-emphasis on sex, an underplaying of friendship, a lack of neighbourliness or an absence of nourishing culture. It&#8217;s also, at an internal level, bugs in one&#8217;s emotional software that make one afraid to get close to others.</p>
<p>In the area of understanding, it&#8217;s a lack of good media, a suspicion of introspection and psychotherapy, and a pompous and disconnected academic world.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1323531.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1323531.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Prince William''s Future University In Scotland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And in the area of service, it&#8217;s an over-exaggerated concern for money in individuals and companies that puts the focus on financial gain over the genuine needs of others. It&#8217;s overly large systems in which the individual is lost and can&#8217;t see the impact of his or her work. And internally, it might be about an inner timidity, snobbery or a follow-the-herd mentality, which prevents one from properly getting to know oneself and one&#8217;s authentic talents.</p>
<p>To build a more meaningful world, we have to place the emphasis on emotional education, on community, on a culture of introspection and on a more honest kind of capitalism.</p>
<p>We may not have meaningful lives yet, but it&#8217;s central to affirm that the concept of a meaningful life is eminently plausible – and that it comprises elements that can be clearly named and gradually fought for.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nasa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5741" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/nasa.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="nasa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5>A globular cluster, photographed by NASA&#8217;s Hubble telescope</h5>
<p class="p2">Today, like so often, the world seems insane. We need perspective. We need to breathe deeply and climb high above the mantle of the earth, beyond the atmosphere, out into a place of unfathomable silence and majesty.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Globular clusters are dense bunches of hundreds of thousands of stars. They contain some of the oldest surviving stars in the universe. Almost 95 percent of globular cluster formation occurred within the first 1 billion to 2 billion years after our universe was born in the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The picture, taken by the Hubble telescope, says nothing directly about what happened today in our country, it does not refer directly to the murder, the court case, the economic data or to our relationships or the stresses and tribulations of our day to day lives. Its function is to give us access to a state of mind in which we are acutely conscious of the largeness of time and space and our own smallness and weakness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It&#8217;s normally unpleasant to be made to feel small (by a boss or a waiter in a smart establishment), but to be made to feel small by something so much more majestic and powerful than we are has something redeeming and enhancing about it. The image of the globular cluster is sombre, rather than sad; calming, but not despair inducing. And in that condition of mind &#8211; that state of soul, to put it more romantically &#8211; we are left, as so often when we look at the stars, better equipped to deal with with the intense, intractable and particular problems and griefs we have to deal with.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The tensions in my marriage, the frustrations of my work, the madness of my society, they are all part of the structure of the universe. We have to accept them as we have to accept the explosion of gasses a billion light years away.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We should start by admitting that the drive for perfection can be an astonishing, admirable and fruitful human capacity. Perfectionism is at play in a snooker break of 147; Tolstoy’s <i>Death of Ivan Ilyich; </i>the gold medal Olympic ten meter dive; Bach’s <i>St Matthew Passion; </i>Mies van der Rohe&#8217;s Barcelona Pavilion&#8230;</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Perfectionism can take a grip anywhere in life, but it is particularly evident in certain areas. The material realm for a start. There can be a yearning for an environment that is entirely neat, clean, harmonious and beautiful. For example: for a kitchen which is spotless; or for a serene and perfectly ordered living room or for an office in which all the plugs and wires are hidden away; the desk is not crowded; and everything has a drawer to go into. Romantic life is similarly marked by deep longings for perfection. There is the aspiration to be wholly understood by someone who combines beauty, wisdom, grace and kindness. We may similarly dream of the perfect family: children who get along well with each other, who are close to their parents and who do their homework enthusiastically. There is intense perfectionism around art as well: we may want to paint a picture which perfectly encapsulates a mood; take a photograph which faithfully expresses one’s experience or write a story that completely evokes the sense of a particular place.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460701678.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5594" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460701678.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Olympic champions in Synchronized Swimming Present a Show" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We are perfectionists because our imaginations are so adept at conjuring up improved images of life. This is very useful and necessary in many situations. We need to be able to imagine good scenarios so as to gain the energy and focus to try to bring them about. In the early stages of human history, people had to imagine things they didn’t have: a ready supply of fresh drinking water; a way of protecting themselves from wild animals at night&#8230; </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Ideally, the imagination would be limited to prompting ambitions which were within practical reach. But the imagination inherently overshoots. It isn’t good at tailoring its suggestions to an accurate assessment of both our personal abilities and how hospitable the outer world might be to our desires. It seems we have been endowed by nature with drives which are beneficial to the species, but may not work to our own particular advantage as individuals. As with salmon leaping up waterfalls to return to their original spawning grounds, we are hardwired with imperatives (to succeed, to win, to master), which have no regard for our personal capacities to deliver on them. Nature doesn’t care that we ourselves can&#8217;t write a particular sonata or launch a cherished business idea; our drives are independent of our talents to deliver on them. Only one salmon in a thousand ends up reproducing successfully&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/457947984.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5598" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/457947984.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Salmon Tagged As They Swim Upstream From The Atlantic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> It&#8217;s in part the fault of the modern world. Until recently, ambition was for the very few. Then came America. Since 1945, the American Dream has (across the globe) projected all sorts of notions: the idea that everyone can attain material prosperity and have a happy home life, that it is normal for couples to have wry but deeply loyal and contented relationships, that sexual fulfilment is possible over decades with the same person, that neighbours on the whole can be great friends, that children typically have immense respect for their parents (tempered by occasional light teasing); that everyone can be a winner at the office. The American Dream has vastly increased opportunities for happiness &#8211; and, of course, at the same time, also expanded the spectre of panic and difficult perfectionism. It has moved a great many areas of human activity from the realm of things that were deemed very likely to go badly wrong – to the realm of things that could and should be perfect if only one can follow a few simple and fairly easy rules. It has made hope the norm and internalised the burdens of failure. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The standard line is hence to say that perfectionism is impossible and should be given up on at once. We’re typically invited to imagine that the mature, wise life is one that has shed all links to perfectionism. The very term ‘perfectionist’ is generally used as a criticism: to point out when someone sets unnecessarily, even ridiculously, high standards for themselves and others. It is in the same territory as fussy, pedantic and obsessive.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/89660023.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5600" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/89660023.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Mies Van de Rohe ¥s pavilion, Barcelona Sculpture of the Mies Van de Rohe ¥s pavilion, Barcelona" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> But perfectionism is not always wrong. And, strikingly, when we encounter things we do consider perfect (like, perhaps, the music of Bach or the villas of Palladio), we don’t usually call their creators perfectionists. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> So really, we just have to get a little better at handling our perfectionism. For a start, we have to learn how much effort is required to get anything to go well. In a culture like ours, which generally tries to please the consumer, the pains of the producer are kept well out of sight. The chef’s nightly anxiety over creating a dish is carefully hidden from the customers. The child does not know the level of effort, self doubt and worry that the parent contends with; we don&#8217;t think about the struggles going on in the cockpit, on the factory floor or in the boardroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/51539163.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5602" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/51539163.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Picture dated 16 October 2004 of villa R" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We are always exposed first to the competence of the practiced professional. It is only when we take the path from consumer to producer that we are confronted with how tricky it all really is, and how feeble and inadequate our own resources are likely to be. So we need a saner picture of how much agony lies behind everything we admire and wish to emulate.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Good perfectionism means being able to tolerate the torments of imperfection – in oneself and others – for long, tumultuous periods. Success means having to forgive oneself the horrors of the first draft.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We need similar degrees of patience when it comes to love. The foiled perfectionist tends to lash out; but no one was ever changed by being called unpleasant things and having a door slammed on them. The intensity of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>disappointment at certain failures in our partners can be so great, it cuts us off from the poise necessary to educate them into respecting (and then perhaps) living up to one’s vision. One ends up shouting when one should have patiently explained. The good solution is not necessarily for the perfectionist to give up on their devotions, just to get better at explaining and sharing them. Perfectionists forget what it is like not to be them: to be unimpressed or indifferent towards topics which feel so spontaneously crucial to them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462007584.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5603" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462007584.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="Greece Prepares For This Weekend's General Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> The improvement of others &#8211; which the perfectionist is after &#8211; requires boundless reserves of kindness, patience and gentleness. That is, it requires a more accurate insight into the difficulties a basically kind and clever person might genuinely face when dealing with an issue (punctuality, keeping the kitchen clean etc.) which comes very easily to one. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Of course, there will be certain areas in which we simply have to surrender our perfectionism.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/157877021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5610" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/157877021.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Woman trying to clear and get on top of housework." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> The trick is to accept that good enough can be good enough. Perfectionists assume that it is only the flawless version of something that is worth having. They feel: if we are late, the evening can’t be a success. If the car is scratched, I can’t enjoy driving it; if the room is untidy, I can’t love my home. To cope, they need to learn how imperfect something can be and yet still retain a great deal of its charm.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Statistics can help too. Because the media concentrates on success stories, the remedy is more accurate information. We need to know the true incidence of arguments in couples, or of failures among businesses or of despair in the hearts of good people.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_605079m.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5609" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_605079m.jpg?resize=635%2C417" alt="Woody Allen and Diane Keaton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Humour helps as well. There’s a particular vein of humour that gets us to take generous pleasure in the failings of others. <i>Monsieur Hulot&#8217;s Holiday</i> or Woody Allen’s <i>Annie Hall</i> show us characters who fail profoundly &#8211; by the standards of the quest for perfection &#8211; but still end up end being rather nice people, worthy of tenderness and sympathy. We don’t laugh out of contempt, but because we are charmed. The klutz walks into the door, the nerd fails to get the girl, someone gets fired, the holidays go wrong &#8211; and yet we are not downcast. Humour allows us to see that we don’t need everything to be perfect in order for it to be acceptable. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Finally, we need friends whom we can regularly commune with around failure. We pay a high price for our furtiveness about our own setbacks. We dwell in a glossy world in which being successful seems almost the equivalent to being an acceptable person. We don’t want to look foolish and don’t want other people to write us off as failures. But failure in most areas is the (secret) norm. We misjudge how common are our tribulations. Admitting imperfection is part of learning how to have a slightly less damaged and slightly less punitive inner life. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Why does being ‘a good person’ have such a bad name? In the modern world, the idea of trying to be good or kind conjures up all sorts of negative associations: of piety, solemnity, bloodlessness and sexual renunciation. It’s telling that ‘wicked’ has even become a term of praise.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet the project of being good is as vital, or even more important, for the individual and society as is the project of being healthy. Yet while we have no problem with going to the gym to get fitter, it sounds deeply weird, even creepy, to suggest that one might ‘work’ at being better or nicer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4126" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowning.jpg?resize=635%2C673" alt="Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we imagine that practice has nothing to do with being good – and if it is involved, then it’s merely a route to being fake. We assume you just are good (or are not) but exercise is not involved. This seems profoundly mistaken. Just as we have physical muscles, so we have ethical ones, and they too must be put through their paces. Goodness has to be worked at.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the ethical gym of the future, we might regularly be put through our paces. We would have to imagine life through another’s eyes, practice giving way in arguments, emulate the diplomacy and tact of paragons of patience and learn to deflect despair through calculated doses of hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aristotle thought that being good meant practising twelve key virtues, Christianity argued for seven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no scientific answer, but the key seems to be to have some kind of list with which to guide our efforts at being good. We all want better lives, until now, too few of us have shown much interest in being better people.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We live in a world saturated with disagreement. People are at odds about pretty much everything from when to order a taxi, go out to dinner to whether there should there be a caliphate; from the kind of orbit the International Space Station should assume; the right way to cook lasagna to whether Hungary is in Eastern or Central Europe, and how long a child should be allowed to play Minecraft on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While disagreement <i>can</i> be civilised, interesting and productive, it is much too frequently a powerful source of misery: we get enraged and bewildered; we are appalled at the views of others and feel intensely bothered by them; we feel defeated, hopeless and lonely; we agonise, rehearse the conflict alone in our heads, worry, feel guilty, get upset…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/464487025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5339" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/464487025.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Morecambe and Wise." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreement is especially pressing now, because of certain large societal forces that have been building for the last couple of centuries. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">1. Politics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The developed world is now democratic. We’ve long been moving away from habits of deference and from hierarchies in which most people don’t feel it’s their role to have much of a view about a lot of things. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When everyone can vote it matters a lot what everyone thinks. Having opinions becomes more than a luxury, indeed, it’s a necessity in a well-functioning democracy: one needs to have opinions about everything from who should rule to where the nuclear power stations should be positioned. But while we are encouraged to have opinions, little attention is paid to what we do when &#8211; as seems to be the constant case &#8211; we find that these opinions clash bitterly with those of our fellow citizens.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">2. Relationships of Equality</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To ask any couple what they disagree about is one of the more fascinating and consoling exercises: we realise we’re not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">At the same time, disagreement in relationships feels more troubling than in the past, because low expectations once made contentions both routine and in line with aspirations. One was less disturbed by disagreements because the idea of a relationship of total agreement, sympathy and mutuality wasn’t on the cards &#8211; it is a very recent invention, dating back (at best) to the mid-eighteenth century.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/527771563.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5341" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/527771563.jpg?resize=635%2C367" alt="Rinald and Armida" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5">There is also the issue of hierarchy. For most of history, we lived in patriarchies: it was the men who settled disagreements within families. Now there’s a profound (but historically still quite novel) sense of equality, between couples and also with children. We trust that couples should talk through their beliefs, they should know and be interested in, and respect, each other’s minds. No one can be the boss in any particular area.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This extends to children: children are taken to be founts of spontaneous insight and novel perspective. Their opinions deserve to be listened to as well. So concerned are we to ensure that children’s egos are not prematurely crushed, we encourage them to have opinions about all aspects of life. It can – as a result – be extremely hard to come to a decision on anything, including what to have for dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The democratic cacophony and chaos within the family mirrors that in the political world beyond.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">No longer able to govern hierarchically, we are not yet able to reach understanding and manage disagreement. This is the moment we are at.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The closer we are to someone, the more disagreement has the power to upset us. And we are upset because a deep longing in love is to find someone who wholly agrees with us about everything.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If a distant cousin doesn’t have the same taste in films, we don’t care. If our lover doesn’t think a particular scene is funny, we might start to question the foundations of our union.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We demand much higher levels of agreement in personal relationships than in other parts of our lives, because we are looking for our views to be confirmed and understood at every step.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That is because we are vulnerable here as we are in few other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">3. Technology </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has made disagreement more vivid. We are very readily brought into contact with other people’s abrasive attitudes – which, until recently – we could never have encountered. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">If you follow a BBC report on a speech given by the leader of the opposition (for instance) you are alerted to the fact that someone by the name of Cockshield considers him to be an ‘ugly socialist maggot!’ and you get exposure to the opinion of a certain Phill Watts: ‘He does not care about Britain, he cares about his career and making money, he&#8217;s in it for four or five years if he wins and after that he gets a nice big pay check and an early retirement and a luxury life that is his real goal.’ </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the past, the capacity to express disagreement was curtailed by fear of laying oneself open to the retaliation from the person one disagreed with. If one called someone a ‘thieving, lying worthless piece of shit’, one would be expected to be condemned by the community and possibly challenged to a duel. Now, one can throw out sentences like this on social media with zero cost and in total anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In addition, there’s a feeling that being verbally abused online isn’t such a problem. One mustn’t be thin-skinned, one should be able to put up with the nasty comments of others. While our societies are very alive to certain forms of racism and misogyny, they are still remarkably sanguine about the ordinary forms of abuse that are traded on social media every minute.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/455928842.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5382" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/455928842.jpg?resize=635%2C417" alt="Outside The Brooklyn, NY Court House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> We do not, as a society, take ‘being offended’ very seriously &#8211; and therefore offence is rife.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has also generated stronger opinions; it has emboldened people whose opinions might previously have been hedged by a doubt about whether anyone else agreed, by introducing them to people who agree with them and strengthen their convictions. Someone with a passing, slightly embarrassed sense that Pluto should be recategorised as a planet can now join multiple websites full of people who think of little else. The same applies to politics, pornography, religion etc. If you are a Marxist but also a Christian Fundamentalist you can inhabit a corner of the online world in which it is taken for granted that this is the only intelligent way to see the world. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So thanks to technology, we are exposed to the uninhibited disagreements of other people – and also the emboldening reassurance of fellow tribal devotees. In short, technology polarises and inflames. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still, rather than despair, we must accept that disagreement will be constant and ubiquitous. We might fantasise about universal harmony, about reason prevailing spontaneously and about everyone being sweetly tolerant. But vicious disagreement is not going to go away by itself. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So we need to learn how to disagree well, how to navigate through a life in which we will inevitably conflict with many people over expectations, demands, hopes, convictions, priorities and attitudes. We need to deal well with disagreement so we can cope better in our own lives and make our own contributions (however modest) to a saner society.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><strong><span class="s2"> HELPFUL MOVES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DON’T RUSH OVER DISAGREEMENTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreements are often aggravated by a refusal to give them the time they would need to be properly untangled, because we assume that they aren’t inherently difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We think it should be ‘easy’ to agree on certain things &#8211; who should run the country or what to do about pollution or how to arrange the bedroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An unwarranted notion that something is ‘common sense’ is the fuel that aggravates many disagreements.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We should take inspiration from the patient way in which Socrates, the first great philosopher, untangled the knots in thinking in the minds of his fellow Ancient Athenians. It might take an hour to go through someone’s ideas of justice or goodness or love.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5359" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg1.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A fatal assumption of the obviousness of things particularly bedevils domestic life. Here couples are routinely to be found not only disagreeing, but also feeling that their disagreements are small and should be dealt with fast. How silly to spend an hour arguing over the temperature of the bedroom. How absurd to disagree (again) about what time it’s best to order the taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We work with an unhelpful picture of seriousness. There&#8217;s a particular kind of bad mood that follows when something one expected to be easy turns out not to be. One is at once seriously angry and unable to take one&#8217;s anger seriously. Reduced to stalemate, what follows is nagging and shirking. Nagging: that repeated unsympathetic and unpsychological attempt to force the other party into acquiescence, without any attempt to understand their position (as one might try to do if one accepted that something was hard). Nagging assumes the partner could only be disagreeing out of wilfulness and therefore that prodding and poking can be the only recourse. And shirking: that sullen refusal to respond to the poking while maintaining an underhand, despairing reluctance to put forward any convincing rationale for one&#8217;s resistance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The two parties hope the problem – so boring to them both – will simply go away. Yet there are, of course in reality, no &#8216;small&#8217; issues. Philosophies of life stir and collide beneath the surface of apparently petty squabbles. Irritations are the outward indications of stifled debates about competing conceptions of existence. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If we’re going to disagree, and we will, we should at least do our disagreements the honour of spending a lot of time on them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DISAGREEMENT IS NORMAL</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To continue a little further with something that pertains particularly to relationships: it’s easy to be embarrassed about how much disagreement there is in the average relationship. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We think it’s weird, but it’s not. It’s just that our idea of the normal is skewed unfairly towards harmony. So it would be hugely helpful to see more evidence of couples disagreeing. Generally, we see other people&#8217;s relationships only from the outside: we see couples walking comfortably round the market buying apples or bantering at a drinks party. We hardly ever get to see what they are like together in their trickier moments, what goes on when they get very upset, in what ways do they make each other deeply frustrated: how they drive each other mad. How many things they disagree on, and with what passion and intensity, and also, with what tragic-comic results.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/window.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5347" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/window.jpeg?resize=635%2C423" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By total contrast, we know our own relationships from the inside. The difference between these perspectives makes for a damaging distortion. Our sense of what a &#8216;good enough&#8217; relationship looks like is unfairly biased. We need to help ourselves to a more accurate, more informed picture of normal relationships. Despite all the books and the films: art lets us down in terms of holding up an adequate mirror to our daily follies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Pretty high levels of conflict, meanness, folly and disappointment are standard. They are part and parcel of good enough relationships. A good relationship isn&#8217;t one in which the couple get along well most of the time. It&#8217;s one in which they&#8217;ve learned to accept that painful difficulties and frustrations are normal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That this piece of knowledge is not yet very widespread explains the ongoing high incidence of divorce. We are not only unhappy, fatefully, we believe that our unhappiness is anomalous and a sign of error: and so we escape our perceived &#8216;unnecessary&#8217; troubles by leaving one relationship and starting another. And end up with a different set of sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DON’T IMPORT ENERGY FROM ELSEWHERE INTO YOUR DISAGREEMENTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many of our disagreements are broadly about intellectual matters: the future of the euro, immigration, debt, censorship, education policy… </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You might find yourself taking a passionate stand on the economy of Peru, the importance of George Orwell, whether the Chinese reached America in the 15th Century, the status of women in 18th century France … (Everyone’s list is unique). These are not inherently unworthy topics – but the intensity that gets invested in them can be disproportionate to what is really at stake. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In cooler moments you might wonder why you get so worked up about them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It’s here we encounter the phenomenon of <b><i>Energy Imported from Elsewhere</i></b>: in this dynamic, the fuel for a disagreement is not coming purely from the topic under debate. The intensity comes from things that are going on elsewhere in your life. At the time we don’t realise that this is what is going on – which makes it very hard to calm a disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Energy gets imported in at least <b><i>five </i></b>distinctive ways: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">One: Anger is redirected and concentrated</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You are angry about something, or someone &#8211; but for some reason that anger can’t find a good outlet. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It could be someone senior at work (to whom you can’t express your annoyance).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/105698990.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5348" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/105698990.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A friend who has let you down but you don’t want them to see how hurt you are.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Multi-polar frustrations: the train was late, your shoe hurts, you feel tired – but there’s no one in particular to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The anger that belongs in these other places gets imported into the disagreement. It gets discharged on a convenient (but otherwise inappropriate) person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Two: We are arguing with the past</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes we’re disagreeing with people who are dead or gone. The present disagreement is a proxy for an issue from the past. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You could never get your father to see the merits of your career choice, so you try to convince him via getting worked up with the person sitting next to you at dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5362" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="200364690-008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was an acquaintance at college whose political ideas irritated you; you are always trying to prove them wrong via lecturing strangers at drinks parties.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your ex-partner was always going on at you for being selfish; now you try to win the argument against them by mocking ‘bleeding hearts’ to anyone who will listen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Three: Frustrated sexual desire gets channelled into disagreement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There’s someone you are attracted to (though you might be reluctant to admit it); you find them exciting &#8211; but they don’t seem much interested in you. Disagreement offers a way of making contact; you contradict them, you make them acknowledge the importance of a certain fact; you rather forcibly try to dislodge one of their pet theories. The energy isn’t coming just from the overt topic – it’s borrowed from thwarted desire. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Four: We are trying to compensate for a feeling of humiliation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In an unequal world, some have more than us. It might be more money, more status, better looks or more education. And we are easily made to feel lesser – even if it’s not at all what the other person intends. The pent up fear of humiliation can get re-directed towards argumentative aggression. Argument becomes an alternative to a fight we’re not allowed to have.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Five: We long for clarity in an ambiguous world</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Often we have to live with huge amounts of uncertainty and ambiguity. In most cases, we just don’t know what the right answer is.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">A major project at work might not succeed, you have to grapple with issues where there’s no obvious right or wrong – no one knows yet; should you stay in a relationship or leave – it can be agonisingly hard to weigh the pros and cons; how should you deal with a friend who is being difficult but who you like very much. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> We have a deep longing to find things that are simple and clear – and often, topics over which we disagree passionately provide the perfect opportunity. You find someone who is totally wrong (over the Euro or immigration). You feel you are completely right. The decisiveness might not really be justified – but you need to find something to be completely right about – given how much you worry about what is right in other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The more you are aware of this possibility, the more you can see it happening, in your own life and in the behaviour of others. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Repatriation of Energy is a major task of maturity. We need to return emotions to where they really belong. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The idea that energy can be imported into a disagreement from elsewhere helps one: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Grasp when someone else is grappling with an issue that’s actually off the page. We can be more charitable to them. Their apparent venom or excessive heat is less disturbing. We understand that it’s really about something else and that’s very, very normal. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Be readier to apologise and reign yourself in. Ask yourself: am I importing energy? Because you understand that – without meaning to – you will sometimes be getting bothered by something quite different from the topic of disagreement.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Break deadlocks. Disagreements that seem stubborn could be managed if we could repatriate the energy on both sides. He says: I want the bedroom at 22 degrees Celsius. She says: I want it at 18. The repatriation solution looks elsewhere: it suggests that why people get so stubborn or entrenched in their positions can have other causes. For instance: he’s less willing to compromise on this, because he’s got to accept too many compromises at work. And she’s determined to win this one, because she always felt that her sister got to decide how things would be when they were children. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Saying that a disagreement is fuelled by imported energy can sound patronising. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There’s a danger that we’ll make an analysis of the origins of someone’s strong views which will inflame them further.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They will ardently deny it has anything to do with their mother or situation at work – they will insist on the ‘higher’ cause (global politics etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The offence is unfounded: there’s nothing necessarily ‘high’ about passion derived from intellectual issues or ‘low’ about passion from more biographical issues.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still, it’s not wise always to tell the other person what you think. Your diagnosis can’t necessarily be shared. But having it in mind, will stop you from fruitless antagonism. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>TRAUMA: AUDIT OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF IDEAS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The word trauma sounds dramatic, but all of us carry experiences of deep disturbance and threat around certain things. And these traumas often have a powerful, usually unacknowledged, impact on the way we think now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our culture is under the spell of objective disagreement. We like to feel that we’re discussing facts and sifting evidence and constructing rational arguments. But when the pure debate about ideas is going badly – and disagreement seems bitter but fruitless – it can help to discuss the origins of ideas in our own lives. The ideal is to turn the conversation away from what this person thinks now and explore how it has come about that they hold the views they do. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study one</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Consider someone who is violently anti-conservative: anything that seems to support the status quo, or that is favourable to business, meets with extreme hostility. Arguing the other side (not everything that exists is bad, business is a major human activity) gets nowhere. Every suggestion you make is rejected. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Probing their background and early experiences might reveal that their father’s career was thrown into disarray in a period when a Conservative government was in power. It was a terrible time for their family. Their parents were very worried; their father felt humiliated. The government’s policies were implicated; cuts to state expenditure were a key factor in their father’s job being axed. It’s entirely understandable they feel the way they do. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study two</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You meet someone who is violently opposed to modern architecture in any form and insists that classical architecture is the only good kind. They sound slightly crazy on this topic. Instead of trying to persuade them that there might be at least a fair number of great modern buildings, you might ask about their early experiences of architecture. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> It turns out that in their adolescence &#8211; when life felt dangerously chaotic &#8211; they’d been drawn to buildings that seemed very calm, quiet and dignified, and that these were all classical in style. There was a particular part of the city they lived in that they loved for this reason. Then a dramatic, assertive modern building went up just there (just about the time their parents divorced). It felt like a personal attack, it seemed to be destroying an imagined refuge.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459653584.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5352" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459653584.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Thanksgiving Service At St Paul's" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The idea each of these people dislikes (conservatism, modern buildings) represents a<b><i> fear</i></b>. And the positions they espouse (Socialism, classicism) represent to them an <b><i>imagined solution</i></b>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This is typical about many topics over which we disagree.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Once we accept this, we might still not see eye-to-eye about economics or architecture. But the person who opposes us no longer appears merely stubborn and narrow-minded: they have a fear and they have gravitated to an <b><i>imagined solution</i></b> – and we need to be aware of both of these moves&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By understanding the history that an idea or position occupies in someone’s mind, we grow better able to see some of the slightly haphazard, unfortunate associations it has picked up in their biography – but that don’t intrinsically belong to it. Modernist buildings are not really an attack on this person&#8217;s well-being. Conservatism doesn’t, on the whole, mean that people’s parents lose their jobs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>UNFORTUNATE INTRODUCTIONS TO IDEAS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another way in which we can have difficulties reaching agreement is that we frequently encounter ideas via people. This means that certain dispositions get unnaturally tainted, depending on who introduced us to an idea, with negative auras which are then very, very hard to shift using the normal means of conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We might have crucially encountered a line of thought via negative or frightening people; or (alternatively) it might have been unnaturally boosted by being advocated by someone who we loved and trusted – and now feel a need to be loyal to, so loyal as to preclude any disagreement with them or departure from their original ideologies. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case studies:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A very engaging, now dead uncle was immensely critical of trade unions and used to be very witty about their failings. You’ve never been able to take labour unions quite seriously since then and instinctively regard them with suspicion. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A lovely art teacher really admired Andy Warhol, who in their eyes was the consummate 20th-century artist. Doubts about his genius now strike you as provincial and offensive, and a betrayal of a very nice old friend.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1275384221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5360" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1275384221.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Ron Galella Archive - File Photos 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You knew an awkward, terribly shy person at college who was a devout Catholic. Without quite realising it, that’s become your standard picture of religious belief. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You knew an awkward, terribly shy person at college who was devoted to astronomy. Without quite realising it, this has become your standard picture of scientists. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Taking an audit of one’s own psychological intellectual history reveals the debt that one’s ideas owe to the accidents of personal experience. It’s not the issue in itself that we are responding to; we see it through a distorting filter.  We are blurring concepts and people. Our intellectual life runs the risk of being held hostage by these accidental associations, which don’t do any justice to the issues involved. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><strong><span class="s2">Exercise: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">List ways in which an early trauma or personal association might have affected your own convictions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now allow the concept to grow apart from the people who may have first introduced you to it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We try to imagine the nicest person who might hold this view and how and why. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If one is anti trades-union, imagine a charming, civilised person who is all for them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/170400357.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5355" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/170400357.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="One Campaign's Agit8 Event At Tate Modern - Day 1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If one is anti-conservative, imagine the case being made by someone who is kindly and astute.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you despair of modern architecture, think of the defence that could be made for it by a serious, sweet natured and sensitive individual </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We don’t necessarily end up changing our own convictions. What changes is our mental picture of the disagreement. To feel that the other view can be held by an honourable and wise person doesn’t have to mean you give up your own beliefs. But it does mean that you can have a much more productive and interesting time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>SURRENDER THE PLEASURES OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In theory we are not meant to like strong disagreement – the situation in which we tell ourselves the other person is very, very wrong in their opinions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But there’s a dark truth: instead of feeling uncomfortable, sometimes we actually like it very much. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It happens quite often around politics: one has the idea that those on the other side are terrible people – not simply in error but also cruel, selfish, short-sighted, stupid and dangerous. They are very bad people indeed. Leaving aside the truth of the matter about whether (say) Catalonia would be better off apart from Spain, whether integration with Europe is good or bad for the UK, the nature and urgency of climate change or the status of religious belief, these are all topics around which some people end up loathing and looking down on those on the other side. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Why is this actually rather tempting? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>Reason one:</strong> we get a reassuring encounter with our own convictions. We get a powerful feeling of being right (which is much more appealing than the sense that everything is murky and confusing). It is an antidote to melancholy and ambiguity. If the ‘enemy’ is evil, we must be good. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>Reason two:</strong> the disagreement (in which we feel righteous and indignant) provides a conveniently precise – local – target for otherwise wide-ranging disappointment. Instead of feeling broadly dissatisfied with life and oneself there is now an explanation: this awful person, or these awful people.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">However pleasing self-righteousness can be, it’s deeply depressing in its effects, because it means one is actually giving up on the practical possibility of changing people’s minds or having one’s own mind changed. One is refusing to learn or to teach.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In order to reverse out of a position of self-righteousness, we need to perform an unusual manoeuvre. We need to remember what it was like not to have our present conviction. We need to imagine what it’s like not to agree with oneself. We need to empathise with someone who might not find what we think to be ‘obvious’ in any way apparent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Successful persuasion relies on a memory of what it was like not to agree with one’s current stance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marriage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5356" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marriage.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A standard exercise should run like this: pick a topic that you most easily feel you are absolutely right about (i.e. environment, taxation, drugs laws, pornography&#8230;). Argue against yourself in the most intelligent and sophisticated and sympathetic way that you can muster.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreements often involve labelling the person one is in conflict with: ‘fascist’, idiot, bigot, neat freak, selfish. Such names cut us off from an account of what might really be going on in the head of the other person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If we want to cope better with disagreement (and feel less threatened by it, more at ease with it, and have a better chance of reaching an agreement) we need a more benevolent picture of the other person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>THE USES OF ART IN SOLVING DISAGREEMENT</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One way to lessen disagreement is to get people reading more novels and watching more of certain sorts of films.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The stories we need are those that explain how someone who at first seems utterly unworthy or our regard or understanding is, in fact, properly deserving of sympathy and empathy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charles Dickens was immensely effective at this. For example, in <i>David Copperfield</i>, he showed his Victorian contemporaries that (for instance) a convicted pickpocket was not necessarily some alien creature; but that there were many fearsomely plausible pathways to such conditions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Over the course of the novel, we learn that David Copperfield is not the wretched and unsympathetic character that most middle-class Victorians would automatically have assumed he was if they’d spotted him in the street. They get to understand how a decent person – how might you, his reader – end up in his situation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_2059415a-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5379" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_2059415a-1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="DAVID COPPERFIELD, Elizabeth Allan, Freddie Bartholomew, Jessie Ralph, 1935." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We can very usefully make the same kind of move around beliefs that we (perhaps vehemently) disagree with.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We need to ask the Copperfield Question: how could a good person end up here? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We sometimes get nervous around the move because it can feel too much like condoning that conviction. If I understand how a decent, nice person could be a Nazi or an admirer of Stalin, am I not edging towards saying it’s OK to be either of those things? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That fact is, you are not. On the contrary, you are now much better placed to see how to disengage them from those convictions. You have a better chance of teaching them. Because you understand what it is you have to do; and what they are motivated by. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unfortunately, the media does not help, because generally it does the opposite of what good novels and films do. It builds up caricatures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/486255457.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5365" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/486255457.jpg?resize=635%2C537" alt="Ukip's Nigel Farage Campaigns Before European Elections" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The media provides composite pictures of characters like the recent immigrant, the politician, the CEO and so on. And we use these shorthands to navigate our way through a complex world. They’re often not very good portraits.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And yet the media could be brilliant – and do what Dickens did with pickpockets: namely, humanise those with whom we can’t at first sympathise.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN CREATING ENEMIES</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One major way in which technology makes it harder to understand your enemies (and so makes disagreement harder to deal with well) is by enabling high levels of anonymity.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">People are nasty online for three basic reasons. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>First, the fear of not being heard at all</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This encourages turning up the volume: by being shrill, abrasive, curt, rude… all of which are intensifiers, they attempt to get a message across distances which are smaller than they might imagine. And the fact is that their target is indeed liable to be hurt. From the perspective of the attacker, an insult might be the psychological equivalent of a raised voice. But for the person on the other side, it may provoke deep hurt and mental collapse.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Second, the sense of being anonymous</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We feel unobserved and therefore released from the constraints that arise when we are conscious that our friends and acquaintances or even just strangers will see what we are up to. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Thirdly, it’s not a person on the other end</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We feel that the individual we are disagreeing with is not a whole person in our minds (just as the whole of ourselves is not being engaged by the encounter). We are ready to say things and express ourselves in a manner that we never would if we were speaking to someone face to face.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4798960691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5377" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4798960691.jpg?resize=635%2C367" alt="TURKEY-POLITICS-CORRUPTION-INTERNET-TWITTER-MASS-MEDIA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Traditionally, violent disagreement in politics was tempered by a pivotal figure found in places like London, Paris, New York and Washington DC: the hostess.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Certain unfortunate associations of class, money and taste now separate us from any sympathy for this character, but we’d be wise to see what role hostesses used to play – which is that they would, at the end of a day of fierce disagreements in business and politics, draw adversaries together in the living room or by the bar – and introduce them to one another as people, rather than just as ideological cut outs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The role of the hostess was to introduce one to a sense that the enemy was a whole person, with compatible interests and tastes in other areas. They too might have kids, love football and take an interest in jazz. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has put us at the opposite end of the spectrum from the moves of the hostess. Distance and dehumanisation have made us incomprehensible to one another. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>SNOBBERY</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Part of the reason we disagree with certain ideas and people in a very rigid and unhelpful way is that we are, in areas, desperately snobbish.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Snobbery is here defined as a tendency to judge people and ideas by certain criteria which blind us to their full complexity. The snob might decide that all right wing people are nasty or all Romanians are untrustworthy or everything to do with Existentialism is great (or terrible). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We need to be aware of these snobbish blocks in which certain of our opinions are encased.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If Socrates applied (incognito) for a university post today, he’d get rejected. No Ph.D, no publications, teaching experience only in the market square, hasn’t been awarded any research grants. Or if Jesus turned up (in disguise, under an assumed name) at the Vatican, he’d be regarded as a heretic. They would be high profile victims of snobbery. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Snobbery is the powerful tendency to assume that good things – the things we need – have to come with certain kinds of packaging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/78623574.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5367" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/78623574.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="Socialites attend a country club wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We are very sensitive to, and censorious of, certain cases of snobbery. We castigate the social snob who can’t imagine that someone is delightful if they didn’t go to a particular kind of school or have illustrious ancestors. Or who will write you off on learning you income bracket, where you live or seeing what kind of car you drive. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But snobbery is far more widespread than this. At heart, snobbery is an error of thinking. We disagree with things in too large blocks and disagree in rigid ways. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When we analyse snobbery this way we can see that it applies in some surprising cases.  It’s the same problem, only we haven’t given it the right name yet. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We say: no one from Oxbridge can be nice.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Or: everyone on the left is a dreamer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Or: right wingers are nasty…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">These are entrenched positions – which impoverish us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>HUMOUR</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Intense disagreement tends to be marked by the absence of one very important quality: humour.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Humour is desperately important and useful because what it can do is introduce what is generally missing from passionate disagreements: perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What is a joke? It frequently features a redescription of a serious situation from an oblique or distant perspective, which teases out the latent absurdities or exaggerations in our normal view of it. Our laughter will be evidence that we acknowledge that we have drifted from moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Humour can be far from ‘silly’: it is an agent of moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conflict can be intensified by provocative descriptions. Think of language like this which stokes disagreement and the desire for vengeance:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘The brutal unbelievers are desecrating the sacred soil of the motherland’. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There is a long tradition of this kind of talk, what we might term rabble rousing rhetoric, and which exploits exactly our capacity to lose perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But any description can change our perspective. And if it can do so for the worse (making the conflict or disagreement more intractable, more terrifying) it can also do so for the better &#8211; taking the heat out of it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This is what (dark) humour often does. It brings out the latent absurdity in a situation which has unfairly grown violent or heated. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A couple squabbling over what time to order a taxi might be calmed by their child who steps in to hold up a picture of their Death Clock on an iPad:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s4"><a href="http://www.deathclock.com/">www.deathclock.com</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Take this redescription of World War one: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Because some people in large buildings are worried about what other people might be thinking of them and are anxious not to look foolish, pieces of paper are sent to lots of people in small buildings telling them to put on special kinds of clothes and walk in a certain way and travel, mainly, to France. Then they must live for quite a long time in the ground. Should they see anyone wearing hats of a special shape they must try to insert some metal under the skin of that person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">George Bernard Shaw’s take on patriotism makes the same kind of move: a deflationary, but accurate, redescription:“Patriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it&#8230;” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Imagine seeing this photo: with the caption: ‘You can’t see any borders from up here.’</span></p>
<p class="p9"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/s127e006561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5368" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/s127e006561.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="s127e006561" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This to shake fierce nationalists from some of their conviction.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This absolutely isn’t to say that there might not be times when we need to be perfectly serious – and times when it is good to be elevated. The point is just that humorous deflation is a significant resource when disagreement is going badly. We’ve inherited essentially a legal attitude to conflict (which tries to work out who is right and what the evidence is). But often what we need is not to decide who is in the right but to defuse a conflict. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Laughter is a step away from hardened opposition. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>THE ROLE OF SEDUCTION AND REASSURANCE</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When people don’t agree with us, it is natural to respond in three ways:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To get angry with those on the other side: they are stupid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To try to make them feel guilty for their wrong opinions: they are bad people.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To get pedantic and lecture them in great detail: they are ignorant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Those who oppose you may (sometimes) indeed be stupid, bad and ignorant. But telling people they are stupid, bad and ignorant has a very poor record as a means of changing people’s minds – which is, after all, what you want to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It tends, on the contrary, to harden attitudes and make people resent you. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Anger, pedantry and guilt are unsuccessful strategies because they ignore a crucial factor in disagreement. The person on the other side is holding on to a certain position in part because they are scared, disappointed and worried. They don’t want to be bullied, they are alarmed by our stance on an issue which seems so far from what they’d hoped, they’re wondering why they ever agreed to be with us – or why their social life includes people who have such opposed views to theirs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our disagreement is provoking fear and anxiety in them – and that’s in part why it’s very unhelpful to disagree back with them in a way that’s too hard, aggressive or impatient. Such moves don’t do anything to reduce the fear or soothe the anxiety. If we really want people to agree we should, instead, make use of reassurance and seduction. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Reassurance </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It’s easy at once to imagine that the person who is disagreeing violently in a relationship is <i>mean</i> or odd. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And hence one feels sorely tempted to make them <b><i>see</i></b> just how mean and odd they are – in the simple (and terribly natural) conviction that this will lead to a good outcome. If only they could be made to see how appalling they are, then they’d become nice. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><strong><span class="s2">Case study: Refugees in Australia </span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Recently (August 2014) the Refugee Council for Australia put out a statement: </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">As we continue to push away those who seek our help, we risk becoming known as a mean and small-minded nation indifferent to the global challenges of forced displacement. It is high time for Australia to make a real contribution. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">The Council for Refugees is describing the majority view as ‘mean and small minded’ &#8211; which could be true &#8211; but it isn’t likely to win support. In fact, it makes it extremely easy for the government (which is backed by the majority) to paint the Council as arrogant, disloyal and out of touch. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">In spite of the efforts of the Council and a large number of parallel pressure groups &#8211; <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> reports that “A strong majority of Australians, 60 per cent, want the government to “increase the severity of the treatment of asylum seekers.”</span></p>
<p class="p10"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456115410.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5369" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456115410.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Protesters Gather Outside The Australian Embassy In Cambodia Ahead Of Refugee Deal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What’s missing in attempting to calm the disagreement of anti-asylum seekers is a more sympathetic understanding of <i>why</i> people take the view they do on such a topic: an acknowledgement that those who hate asylum seekers might be afraid and worried, rather than mean and unintelligent. The fears have to be acknowledged and taken seriously first, before anyone can change their mind. If you don’t do that your advocacy simply adds to the anxiety and makes the other person <i>less</i> likely to agree with you. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reassurance doesn’t mean saying ‘I know you are afraid’ – which can sound patronising. It starts with a genuine understanding of what the anxieties are – being swamped, ignored, envy that another will get special treatment when you don’t. And then offering a defence against these bad outcomes. Or explaining in terms that work for the other person why these things are not, in fact, going to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We understand this intuitively when dealing with children. If a child is afraid there is a monster under the bed, we don’t think it’s wise to tell them not to be idiotic, cease complaining and grow up. We might examine what bothers them. We look under the bed, and get them to do so too. We might give them a bell to ring to bring us running if a monster should appear. We ask them about anything that might have bothered them during the day. We might even try cutting the legs off the bed. We don’t share the anxiety, but we do the child the honour of taking it very seriously. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reassurance is also crucial in intimate disagreements. There’s a fatal tendency to see the single out-of-control disagreer (one’s partner) as mean – which mars many attempts to make headway in domestic life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study: the sofa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">A: ‘I think we should change the cover on that sofa; I was thinking of this &#8230;’ </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">B: ‘No, no, no. That’s totally disgusting, I hate that. Why are you doing this to me. You are always doing these terrible things .’</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">A: What have I done, I’ve only made a suggestion? </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">B: ‘Fuck off.’ </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The disturbingly intemperate person is not generally mean, they are, above all else, panicked and <b><i>scared</i></b>. Though as yet it is not at all clear what it is they are worried about. Panic here means an inability to calmly explain what it is that is really bothering you. It feels so urgent and so serious that the mind races to aggression. But somewhere, under the aggression, are genuine worries that perhaps can be identified and resolved. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For instance, the agitated one might be (under the surface):</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Anxious about losing control of their life. It’s a real worry, but exaggerated in this one instance. So the move would be to trade off this choice for letting them have their way on something else. It&#8217;s not really the sofa cover they object to.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/129369066.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5370" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/129369066.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="Couple reading weekend newspapers at home, UK" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The proposed cover reminds them of one in a shared house they lived in as a student, in a very unhappy year. They don’t hate you, just a memory. They might be able to adjust, with some sympathetic encouragement. Or possibly not. But it’s a different, less confrontational, issue. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By taking seriously the possibility that the person you disagree with is scared, there’s a huge opportunity to shift the disagreement to more hopeful territory. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Seduction </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In romantic terms, seduction involves being very, very attentive and nice, making the environment just right, saying sweet and exciting things. Seduction can be cynical. But at its best it is a generous art of helping another person overcome their nervousness. Ideally, the seducer helps the one they seduce. When we are seduced (ideally, again) we don’t go against our own best interest; on the contrary, we are deftly assisted to what we really do want, but didn’t have the confidence to pursue. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The honourable seducer knows that people get held back by shyness, nerves and self-doubt. And takes great pains to lull these unhelpful forces. Essentially the seducer possesses a highly important kind of confidence: they know that someone who is not yet convinced can be won over by consideration, warmth and tenderness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Seduction has a role to play in public debate. Consider what can go wrong in its absence. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><strong><span class="s2">Case Study </span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">In 2009, the UK government announced that it was considering cuts to the public founding of Humanities courses. They were testing public opinion to see what kind of support for, or opposition to, such a move there might be. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">The government view was that the Humanities were a luxury, enjoyed by the few and therefore not something that really deserved to be paid for by public funds. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Many people were disturbed by this. <i>The Guardian</i> attacked this as ‘dark philistinism’. The Academy of the Humanities vilified the policies as ‘sterile and outdated.’ The National Union of Students complained that the policy was ‘short-sighted, reckless, socially and culturally barren and fixated on a mean and narrow ideology. They also noted, that the mainstream media had been entirely silent. It may have been the case that the policy was ‘philistine’ and ‘culturally barren’. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Although highly charged, those opposed to the cuts failed to move public opinion to their side. The following year many Humanities courses lost their public funding entirely. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The cause may have been a good one. But the advocacy was not at all seductive. It did not set out to woo people who might be a bit reluctant or not yet convinced.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/458165368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5371" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/458165368.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Humanities students close a supermarket in the center of" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was no attempt to seduce someone who was a bit suspicious of the Humanities to see there might be a point in funding them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At the root of seduction is the insight: In any disagreement, one must try to explain to the other person (or other group) what is so attractive and appealing about our position – rather than focusing on what is bad or wrong with theirs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>STRATEGIC PESSIMISM</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes we can’t make headway in disagreement and therefore need to do that most unfamiliar and rather downbeat move: learn to live with disagreement. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This can feel extremely disappointing. There are some topics we tend to feel are too important for compromise. Typically, they are big political and social matters, which might include:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Climate change</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The economy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Immigration</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Education</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you have strong opinions on these things, you are unlikely to think it’s just fine when others hold very different views. It feels crucial that the truth, as you see it, should prevail. You want things to change in the world. You might be very confident of the rightness of your own position. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But what lends us this belief that the truth can prevail, that other people can be won around, that disagreement works?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When we disagree violently with some people (who we think of as fools and idiots), we are generally in a rather dark and gloomy mood about things. It would feel odd to describe us at this point as being <b><i>optimists</i></b>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And yet that’s precisely what we are and it is an optimism that is deeply dangerous – and something we should try to wean ourselves from. The passionate desire to get people to think as we do is born out of a naive belief that agreement can eventually be found on all great issues and that harmony is the natural state of things between people. Of course, right now we may be in a bit of a fight, but, so the optimistic arguer believer, with a few more assaults on the issue, the argument can be ironed out.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At a political level, it is this sort of optimism which has belied great moments of institutional intolerance. The Soviet Experiment was so violent in part because it was so optimistic about agreement: it genuinely believed that – with a little more prodding and pushing – an entire nation could be made to agree with the principles of Lenin. One has to be a rather optimistic leader to set about torturing members of the opposition into agreement. The Gulag was an act of optimism.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By contrast, modern democratic states are notably pessimistic in their structure about agreement. They know there will always be disputes and therefore, they have learnt to accommodate them. Citizens have the right to disagree, no one can coerce anyone else into belief, we’re often left alone to think what we want. There isn’t a constant quest for total universal approval.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158782062.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5374" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158782062.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="US-POLITICS-ECONOMY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All this is the fruit of pessimism. Pessimism takes as its starting point that agreement between people is actually not the normal order of things. Given how humans are, the possibility of large groups of people thinking the same thing is highly unlikely. We shouldn’t be surprised or indeed too depressed or angry about this – no more than we’d be sad about bad weather or the onset of a bad cold. These things happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Once disagreement starts to be seen as utterly normal, and agreement the rare and beautiful exception, we can stop being so surprised and therefore so passionately annoyed when we meet with someone who doesn’t see eye-to-eye with us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The strategic pessimist also grasps that it’s very unlikely that one can ever rationally persuade people of something: people’s opinions are formed over long years, through emotional dynamics, and ten minutes of conversation over dinner is entirely unlikely to make any difference.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The pessimist therefore shifts the focus away from an attempt to convert to an attempt to endure and manage disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This involves two responses. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The first at the political level is:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>a) Human Rights</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The modern state seeks to create structures that can contain and moderate disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This gets expressed through the language of human rights. This means certain rights to liberty and freedom for the individual are guaranteed. The state cannot coerce, convince or bully the individual.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Citizens are also expected to leave one another alone. One has a lot of freedom from interference.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>b) Manners</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What human rights accomplishes at the political level, manners accomplishes at the private level. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The mannered person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us. They believe deeply in getting on around other people. It is not that they are afraid of ruffling anyone’s feathers per se – but they just doubt whether it is ever really a constructive move and they are not interested in merely symbolic victories. They would prefer to have civil relations with someone rather than tell them frankly what is on their mind. They’re alive to how difficult it is for us to take on board challenging information from someone else. They accept an important role for secrets and white lies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461039834.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461039834.jpg?resize=635%2C472" alt="Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu - Director General of UNESCO Irina Bokova" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The ideal hope is that disagreement can be resolved. Good manners aim at a lesser, but practically crucial goal: how to cope when disagreement won’t go away. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Politeness is a set of tactics for artificially reducing the feeling of conflict, in the absence of real agreement. Instead of being open and honest about how we feel, the well-mannered person will:  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thank someone to whom we do not feel especially grateful. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Smile, when they feel bored.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Laugh when they are not amused.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Say that an idea is interesting, when they think it is unimpressive.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Keep their opposition quiet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Good manners are pessimistic; they build on an acceptance that </span>we can cope with not everyone agreeing with us (especially when we are in the right).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It might be too hard to reach agreement with this person.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We have limited energy and should save it for the most important occasions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not every disagreement is worth resolving, even if the other person is dead wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Social peace is mostly better than conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Being misunderstood is a normal part of life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The key point is that rather than focus on the point of disagreement, manners encourage us to skirt round it, avoid it, and keep it out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your sister’s partner has a whole lot of ideas with which you strongly disagree. But you don’t see them very often. They don’t really listen to you. The fall out with your sister could be awful. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your mother has some cherished views about art, religion and sex which you find deeply unconvincing. But they are very, very important to her. To try to talk her out of them would be cruel. You need to avoid disagreement in order to avoid needlessly hurting her. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An old friend from college has some whacky convictions. But you don’t want to stop seeing them. They are a cherished link to that period of your life. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A work colleague – at a reception – reveals some views about politics with which your are in profound disagreement. But, you are going to have to work with them all next month on a major project. It is crucial you maintain a viable working relationship. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At a dinner you are seated across from someone you find very ill-informed, yet voluble on a range of topics that matter a lot to you. But clearly this person is a great friend of your host. You must not let your contempt show. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You care more for your relationship with your sister than about the rightness or wrongness of the issue with your brother-in-law (the merits of North Sea oil exploration). There are often more important things than to be right. There might be things we care more for than victory in a disagreement. This the mannered pessimist understands.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1174px-StillLifeWithASkull.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5294" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1174px-StillLifeWithASkull.jpg?resize=635%2C487" alt="1174px-StillLifeWithASkull" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For centuries, artists produced ‘<em>memento mori</em>’, works of art that would remind their viewers of death and usually featured a skull or an hourglass.</p>
<p>The point of these works wasn’t to make people despair, but to help them use the thought of death to focus on the real priorities. Vivid reminders of mortality and the transient nature of life put our prosaic obsessions into question. When measured against the finality of death, the true insignificance of some of our worries is emphasised and we’re given an opportunity to feel a little braver about what we really want and feel.</p>
<p>At the Book of Life, we&#8217;re fascinated by the concept of memento mori and have made 5 paperweight memento mori. The first one references the stars. Globular clusters like this one are dense bunches of hundreds of thousands of stars formed over 13 billion years ago. This image, taken by the Hubble telescope, says nothing directly about what happened today at work or in our relationships. Its function is to make us feel small. That’s normally unpleasant, but to be made to feel small by something so much more majestic and powerful than we are has something redeeming and enhancing about it. The image is sombre, rather than sad: calming, but not despair inducing. And in that condition of mind, we are left better equipped to deal with the intense, intractable and particular problems and griefs we have to deal with in our few years on this planet</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/memento-mori-paperweight-stars/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8310" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Memento_box_low-res-21.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="Memento_box_low-res-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are (very roughly) seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains of sand on the earth. The most common constituent of sand is silica, the second is aragonite, which has been created, over the past half billion years, from the crushed remains of various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. Pick up some grains, put them under a microscope and whole worlds appear. In certain strands of Zen Buddhism, sages train themselves to be content to stare for many hours at only a few grains, a symbol of their capacity to pay due attention to the neglected wonders of existence. We too should be content to look closely at grains in a spirit of modesty and humility – and acknowledge that we are, from a sufficient perspective, nothing more substantial than such grains and yet no less interesting or complex for that.</p>

<p>This is a highly magnified image of a single-celled diatom algae. It is one of the tiniest and oldest living things on the planet. The naturalist Charles Darwin wrote about it to emphasise an idea that remains momentous: that we humans evolved from other, simpler species. At the time, this was taken to be dangerously demeaning. But it’s a hugely liberating lesson. Often we expect too much from ourselves and others. We forget our origins as smaller, hairier primates and (before that) simple clusters of cells, like these algae. We need to climb down, and recall our mortality, our frailty, our terrible limitations and our weaknesses – which are tied to our deep ancestry as tiny things at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Eubaphe mendica, also known as the Beggar, is a small yellow moth of fragile appearance and almost translucent wings. In her famous essay, ‘The Death of the Moth’, the English writer Virginia Woolf describes the final moments of just such a moth. It is trapped against a pane of glass. It cannot understand its predicament. It keeps trying to get through, but its energies are limited, its knowledge is too small and its lifespan is desperately short. To be touched by this is to be touched – ultimately – by our own similar fate. We too have brief existences which we risk (so very easily) in hopeless, mistaken efforts; we too are misled, fatally, by things that we think are attractive, and for us as well, death comes far sooner than we would like.</p>

<p>Many of the obstacles we face in our lives are rather like the waves of the sea: relentless, bleak, repetitive and, ultimately, not responsive to our wishes or longings.This is not a cruel fact about one’s own predicament; it is a basic premise of the human condition. Therefore, one should not bring unreasonable expectations and be continually shocked and dismayed when life does not answer to our demands. We should learn to accept all we cannot change and face it with a degree of heroism and Stoic strength, as a sailor battling the waves might. We can also, in the midst of our struggles, appreciate the beauty and grandeur of what we’re up against.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to be pessimistic about many things: the state of the planet, the economy, the future of humanity. And yet there&#8217;s one area where many of us retain a curious sense of optimism. We have faith that from among the millions of our fellow human beings out there, we will one day be able to locate a very special person.</p>

<p>Pessimism is generally equated with a grumpy and immature kind of mood. But it is, in fact, at the origin of wisdom – and can even leave us feeling surprisingly cheerful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are some places that seem almost designed to shatter our peace of mind, places where there is too much human chatter and noise, where there is always a screen in view, where the phone rings incessantly, where we can&#8217;t put our problems into perspective. It seems that calm depends to a rather humbling degree on being able to travel, either in person or in our imaginations, to places well suited to dampening our anxieties.</p>
<p>One of the most calming of all such locations is the sea:  a spot (perhaps a bench on a promenade or a patch of grass on top of a cliff) where we can let our thoughts merge with the grandeur and scale of an ocean &#8211; and thereby feel (in the nicest possible way) how much a lot of what worries us doesn&#8217;t matter &#8211; in the grander scheme&#8230;</p>

<p>Another traditionally very helpful place is the graveyard, where the sight of graves helps us to remember the brevity of our lives and thereby moves us to reorder priorities.</p>

<p>Part of what adds fuel to our stress is an inability ever to be sufficently alone, and to have a chance to sort out our thoughts. That&#8217;s what can make a long drive an ideal place to wind ourselves down.</p>

<p>What brings supreme calm is space &#8211; being made to feel that we are but a tiny element in something far larger and more mysterious. Deserts know this point well.</p>

<p>And of course, the ones who understand it best are the stars&#8230;</p>

<p>But we should try also to understand where procrastination comes from. It isn&#8217;t merely to do with laziness. A lot of is &#8211; at heart &#8211; fear. We begin to work only when the fear of doing nothing at all exceeds the fear of not doing it very well&#8230; And that can take time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern society often tells us that we should learn to feel good about ourselves. Low self-esteem is out. We should be celebrating our goodness, talents and potential. Enough of having to feel ashamed of who we are and what we do.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4105" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerA1.jpg?resize=635%2C386" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Religions couldn’t agree less. All of them carve out moments in the diary when they want us to take stock of all the bad stuff we’re likely to have done, all the unthinking evil and carelessness we’re responsible for – and then they ask us to say sorry. We should look back over our behaviour and do that most unfamiliar and pre-modern thing: atone; that is, apologise for what an idiot and low-key monster one has been over the past few months.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4106" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerB1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="ASH WEDNESDAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every year, Christians around the world mark Ash Wednesday; a central moment of atonement. Believers go to a priest and get a cross drawn on their forehead made out of the ashes of palm trees. It’s a public symbol of one’s commitment to saying sorry for the bad stuff one has done, a sign that one has entered a period of reflection and apology. It’s a deeply charming and useful ritual, from which the more self-satisfied bits of the secular world could learn a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3803" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerC.jpg?resize=635%2C438" alt="Ash Wednesday Maryland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Religions accept that all of us are bad: that we are tempted to deceive, steal, insult, egoistically ignore others and be unfaithful pretty much all the time. The question is not whether we experience shocking temptations or do bad things, but whether we are able once in a while to rise above our awful sides, acknowledge them and say sorry for them. A public invitation to atone is meant to encourage us to inch towards moral improvement. Ash Wednesday teaches us that the faults we have are inevitable facts about being human and we must therefore admit to them candidly and attempt to rectify them in the light of day. It’s as if religions know that feeling that you’re meant to be innocent and good all the time is not helpful if you’re trying to become a better person. It makes us paralysed with guilt over our failure to measure up to impossibly high standards of integrity. It just makes us hypocrites. Far better to be told that we’re all bad, all likely to be mean and thoughtless, and then asked to say sorry – rather than cling on to ideas of our original purity. Confessions of universal sinfulness, symbolised by a black cross on your forehead, turn out to be a far better starting point from which to take the first modest steps towards being an OK person.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4109" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerD1.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Ash Wednesday" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thinking one is great and kind all the time is simply not a good basis for actually being so. Whatever you think of religion, it understands this bit of our psyche pretty well.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Alongside the notes of the musical keyboard and the letters of the alphabet, colours provide the building blocks of our emotions. It is not for nothing that we say we are ‘feeling blue’ or ‘seeing red’. Each colour is subtly connected to a web of experiences and associations. Some of these are highly idiosyncratic: a particular yellow might remind us of a long-dead grandmother’s kitchen or a pair of boots we had as children. But others carry more universal meanings. Exploring the associations we have around colours is a way to get to understand ourselves and, as importantly, gives us a way to tell others who we are.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">YELLOW: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">HOPE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yellow is carefree and confident. It’s not on the defensive. It acts as a shield against despair and feelings of humiliation. It’s eager for our attention, like a happy child delighted to be at the centre of things. At times, its energy can be oppressive, but like its most famous ambassador – the lemon – there are few things it won’t enhance. The German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe loved yellow, considering it to be the colour of a gently hopeful attitude to life. He owned a collection of twenty yellow waistcoats, which he always twinned with white trousers – for he loved a little serenity as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory1.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4130" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory1.jpeg?resize=635%2C487" alt="William_Turner_Light_and_Colour_Goethes_Theory" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Joseph Mallord William Turner, <em>Light and Colour (Goethe&#8217;s Theory)</em>, 1843 </span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ORANGE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">VITALITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Orange is a little more mature, strong and threatening than its neighbour and sibling, yellow. It almost tips over into something frightening. There is much of it in the boiling interior of the sun. Yet in the correct dose, it seems like a concentration of an energy and vitality that too often we lack in our own minds and circumstances. To give over an entire room, car, flag or garment to this colour may be risky, as it can verge on extremity and obsession, and yet to deny the occasional wisdom of the colour seems wrong as well. We should know how to build in moments of what orange represents into a well-balanced life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT RED: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">ADVENTURE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A bright, light red is adventurous, witty, even a touch heartless. It’s not too bothered by what others think. And that’s a tonic when, as is so often the case, we are excessively anxious about the opinions of other people. Light red is not harsh, just independent. It’s more interested in being followed than in being a follower. It’s the colour of your banner when you feel you can take on the world (or some part of it that matters to you).</span></p>

<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK RED: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">POWER</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Napoleon crowned himself Emperor of France in 1804, he wore a splendid crimson velvet cloak. This is the colour of thrones, of cardinals, of power and pomp, of ceremony and feasts. Dark red is sympathetic to authority and favours the idea of maturity. It is assertive and assured, and can function as a reminder of a more demanding, insistent attitude when, through misfortune or our own mistakes, we falter. It speaks to the fragment of a Napoleonic attitude buried in everyone’s soul.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">VIOLET: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">AMBIGUITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Violet is red that has almost been transformed into blue. It holds a little onto both, it remembers both, which makes it mysterious, ambiguous and suggestive. Early Renaissance artists liked to depict angels, busy on errands of mercy between heaven and earth, as wearing violet gowns. The colour evoked for them the idea of an infinite ‘beyond’ that was not threatening or dangerous, somewhere we could long for but which remained always just out of sight.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/208-2-592x10241.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4134" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/208-2-592x10241.jpg?resize=592%2C556" alt="208-2-592x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paolo Veronese, <em>The Dream of Saint Helena,</em> 1570</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT BLUE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">CLARITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Light blue is inescapably the colour of a clear, morning sky – with a cool hint, perhaps, of the north or the mountainside. It’s a colour for being active. It’s undaunted, cheerful, ready to get on and face all the things you’ve been putting aside. Shadows, confusion, doubts and second thoughts go into hiding when light blue appears. It is never cruel, just filled with breezy goodwill. It is logical, clear. It admires the simple, straightforward statement. It wants you to tidy your desk.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK BLUE: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">DISCIPLINE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the colour of order and discipline. It tells us not to give up, to search for reserves of resilience. It is resolute, reliable. Dark blue doesn’t get sidetracked. It sticks to the key task, to the big point. It keeps the end in view. Strong rather than hard; courageous rather than fierce, it is civilised and directed. It is power on our side, protective and helpful. It is the colour of a good, true father.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT GREEN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">SANITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Light green has the fresh, natural feel of sanity. It is summoned when we are grateful rather than envious. When we don’t need to do down others to feel good about ourselves, and when we are more interested in finding out how things go well rather than complaining when they don’t turn out quite right. We can use this colour to help us focus on our power to do something – rather than blame others for our failings or doubt our strengths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3583" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="the-etang-des-soeurs-at-osny-1875.jpgBlog" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Paul Cézanne, <em>Etang des Soeurs at Osny</em>, 1875</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK GREEN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">REALISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The soothing realms of deeper, greyer green are about realism. This word sometimes has unfortunate associations, as though it was the opposite of hope, but in fact, there’s such a thing as mature, realistic hope. This emotion tells us that things are tough, but that the worst will pass, that what we have may be good enough, that we will manage and cope despite inevitable frustrations and compromises. This is hope that has acquired a proper knowledge of the troubles of life – but hasn’t given up. It pulls us back to sobriety, to patience and moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">LIGHT BROWN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">MELLOWNESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a colour that does not want to draw attention to itself. It is conscious of times past, and feels their wistful tug. It likes quiet. It is meditative and gentle. But it is not about putting us to sleep. Light brown is our friend when we want to calm down and avoid external stimulation, so that the quieter, smaller voices of the inner world – the half memories, the tentative associations, the delicate starting moments of a new thought – can be heard.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng_ng_ng1272_large1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4136" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ng_ng_ng1272_large1.jpg?resize=635%2C460" alt="(c) The National Gallery, London; Supplied by The Public Catalogue Foundation" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">John Constable, <em>Cenotaph to the Memory of Sir Joshua Reynolds</em>, 1833-6</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">DARK BROWN: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">DIGNITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dignity means not having to try to impress. You are sure of yourself – of who you are, and what you stand for. It might be the colour of an old mahogany table, with a clock ticking quietly in the background. Time is slow and ample, there’s no rush, no haste. Dark brown is not a hectic colour – it’s the shade of comfort or dark soil on a wet day. Not glamorous, but deeply good and reassuring. It is solid and dependable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">BLACK: </span></strong><strong><span class="s1">AUTHORITY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Black is the perennial colour of fashion and sophistication in the modern world. It is strong, without illusions. It flirts with cynicism. It is the least naive, the least childish of colours. We need black when we want to keep our cool; we’ve seen too much already to get carried away now. It is a reminder of the appeal of being a little bit harsh, a little bit demanding and decisive. Black is lean.</span></p>
<p class="p1">**</p>
<p class="p1">Many of us haven&#8217;t owned a nice box of coloured pencils since we were children. Yet no adult life should be without one, because having a suite of hues at our fingertips provides a route to a wide array of moods and inspirations.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/the-psychology-of-colour/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4138" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/aw14_tsol_website-8-635x4191.jpg?resize=635%2C419" alt="aw14_tsol_website-8-635x419" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We could do worse when getting close to another person than to use each of these pencils in turn and discuss what its colour symbolises for us. And when wondering what mood we are in, we might pick a pencil without thinking too much, doodle with it and dwell on what our choice tells us of our state of mind.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was a sunny Sunday afternoon; you were nine years old. Your parents wouldn’t let you have any ice cream if you didn’t do your maths homework. It was achingly unfair. Every other child in the world was playing football or watching television. No one else has such a mean mother. It was just awful.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We learned self-pity when we were young. We’re all – in theory – dead against it. Self-pity is deeply unattractive because it reveals egoism in its most basic form, a failure to put our own suffering into proper perspective against the larger backdrop of human history. It shows how easily our own stubbed toe might matter more than a million dead in a far-off land.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3573" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845.jpg?resize=635%2C520" alt="the-desperate-man-self-portrait-1845" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Gustave Courbet, <em>The Desperate Man</em>, 1845</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one is likely to own up to feeling self-pity. And yet, if we are honest, in some shape or other it lingers for a long, long time, and that’s understandable. It reflects the paradoxical necessity of having to look after ourselves, of having to be on our side, even though we are not necessarily always the most deserving or the most pitiable candidates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When we encounter self-pity (in a friend, a family member – or even ourselves), there’s a temptation to get very stern. Self-pity is regarded as a rather awful failing, and anyone caught up in it must be forcibly reminded how very lucky they really are. How dare they moan about having to do homework? Don’t they realise there are children with terrible diseases who’d love to be doing maths homework? Haven’t got a job you like? Stop moaning: think of people working the Ndassima gold mine in the Central African Republic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/451638144.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3574" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/451638144.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Ndassima gold mine in Central African Republic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in order to deal better with self-pity (whether in ourselves or others) we have to keep in mind something which this well-meaning – but sadly ineffective – strategy misses. It’s that self-pity starts out as a very important achievement. Imagine what things would be like if we couldn’t pity ourselves. If you think of a parent comforting a child, they are in effect teaching the child how to look after themselves. Gradually we learn to internalise this parental attitude and come to be able to feel sorry for ourselves when no one else will. It’s not necessarily entirely rational, but it’s a coping mechanism. A first protective shell which we develop in order to be able to manage some of the immense disappointments and frustrations that life throws at us. The defensive posture of self-pity isn’t inherently contemptible. It is grounded in something rather touching and useful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s not in the least surprising that we try to keep very painful facts about our own inadequacy and failure at bay. The issue is how one might slowly evolve away from self-pity and here the answer is, always, only through an atmosphere of supportiveness and gentleness. Very few of us ever improve our characters by being shouted at. Self-pity is wisely addressed not by condemnation but by the kind suggestion of better perspective and fair criticism: perhaps one did do something a little wrong, perhaps this won’t seem like such a problem, tomorrow morning… If this can be taken on board, then the need to ward off failure or to avoid responsibility is lessened. Self-pity no longer feels required. We learn through reassurance, not bracing reproof – however precise the condemnation may be.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4141" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project1.jpg?resize=635%2C516" alt="703px-Raphael_-_Madonna_in_the_Meadow_-_Google_Art_Project" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Raphael, Madonna in the Meadow, 1506</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path out of self-pity involves an arc of development. We come to recognise that other people are not always being especially hard on us when they find us wanting. And we come to realise that our sufferings take place within a broad context of unhappiness. Far from meaning that our suffering doesn’t matter, it’s rather the case that all suffering matters and can unite the afflicted into a giant collective, who might – when they have time to look up from their own sorrows – feel pity for one another. Suffering doesn’t have to isolate, it can also bring us together. As we leave self-pity behind we enter a world in which suffering is a constant and failure is the norm. We have not been singled out. Indeed, when we look back from this higher place, we don’t have to find even self-pity so strange or deplorable. This primitive defence mechanism – blaming others and exaggerating one’s woes – is itself deserving of a degree of compassion: of pity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s true progress here and the attainment of a state of mind that should be dignified with a special name: higher consciousness. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Irritability is the tendency to get upset for reasons that seem – to other people – to be pretty minor. Your partner asks you how work went and the way they ask makes you feel intensely agitated. Your partner is putting knives and forks on the table before dinner and you mention (not for the first time) that the fork should go on the left hand side, not the right. They then immediately let out a huge sigh and sweep the cutlery onto the floor and tell you that you can xxxx-ing do it yourself if you know better. It was the most minor of criticisms and technically quite correct. And now they’ve exploded.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is so much irritability around and it exacts a huge daily cost on our collective lives, so we deserve to get a lot more curious about it: what is really going on for the irritable person? Why, really, are they getting so agitated? And instead of blaming them for getting het up about ‘little things’, we should do them the honour of working out why, in fact, these things may not be so minor after all.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The journey begins by recognising the role of fear in irritability in couples. Behind most outbursts are cack-handed attempts to teach the other person something. There are things we’d like to point out, flaws that we can discern, remarks we feel we really must make, but our awareness of how to proceed is panicked and hasty. We give cack-handed, mean speeches, which bear no faith in the legitimacy (even the nobility) of the act of imparting advice. And when our partners are on the receiving end of these irritable ‘lessons’, they of course swiftly grow defensive and brittle in the face of suggestions which seem more like mean-minded and senseless assaults on their very natures rather than caring, gentle attempts to address troublesome aspects of joint life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/50660304.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3568" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/50660304.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Exasperated teacher at public grade scho" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The prerequisite of calm in a teacher is a degree of indifference as to the success or failure of the lesson. One naturally wants for things to go well, but if an obdurate pupil flunks trigonometry, it is – at base – their problem. Tempers can stay even because individual students do not have very much power over teachers’ lives. Fortunately, as not caring too much turns out to be a critical aspect of successful pedagogy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet this isn’t an option open to the fearful, irritable lover. They feel ineluctably led to deliver their ‘lessons’ in a cataclysmic, frenzied manner (the door slams very loudly indeed) not because they are insane or vile (though one could easily draw these conclusions) so much as because they are terrified; terrified of spoiling what remains of their years on the planet in the company of someone who it appears cannot in any way understand a pivotal point about conversation, or cutlery, or the right time to order a taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One knows intuitively, when teaching a child, that only the utmost care and patience will ever work: one must never shout, one has to use extraordinary tact, one has to make ten compliments for every one negative remark and one must leave oneself plenty of time…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/107653969.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3569" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/107653969.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="African Leadership Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All this wisdom we reliably forget in love’s classroom, sadly because increasing the level of threat seldom hastens development. We do not grow more reasonable, more accepting of responsibility and more accurate about our weaknesses when our pride has been wounded, our integrity is threatened and our self-esteem has been violated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The complaint against the irritable person is that they are getting worked up over ‘nothing’. But symbols offer a way of seeing how a detail can stand for something much bigger and more serious. The groceries placed on the wrong table are not upsetting at all in themselves. But symbolically they mean your partner doesn’t care about domestic order; they muddle things up; they are messy. Or the question about one’s day is experienced as a symbol of interrogation, a lack of privacy and a humiliation (because one’s days rarely go well enough).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The solution is, ideally, to concentrate on what the bigger issue is. Entire philosophies of life stir and collide beneath the surface of apparently petty squabbles. Irritations are the outward indications of stifled debates between competing conceptions of existence. It’s to the bigger themes we need to try to get.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the course of discussions, one might even come face-to-face with that perennially surprising truth about relationships: that the other person is not an extension of oneself that has, mysteriously, gone off message. They are that most surprising of things, a different person, with a psyche all of their own, filled with a perplexing number of subtle, eccentric and unforeseen reasons for thinking as they do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The decoding may take time, perhaps half an hour or more of concentrated exploration for something that had until then seemed as if it would more rightfully deserve an instant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We pay a heavy price for this neglect; every conflict that ends in sour stalemate is a blocked capillary within the heart of love. Emotions will find other ways to flow for now, but with the accumulation of unresolved disputes, pathways will fur and possibilities for trust and generosity narrow.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3230446.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3570" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/3230446.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="The Milkman" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A last point. It may just be sleep or food: when a baby is irritable, we rarely feel the need to preach about self-control and a proper sense of proportion. It’s not simply that we fear the infant’s intellect might not quite be up to it, but because we have a much better explanation of what is going on. We know that they’re acting this way – and getting bothered by any little thing – because they are tired, hungry, too hot or having some challenging digestive episode.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The fact is, though, that the same physiological causes get to us all our lives. When we are tired, we get upset more easily; when we feel very hungry, it takes less to bother us. But it is immensely difficult to transfer the lesson in generosity (and accuracy) that we gain around children and apply it to someone with a degree in business administration or a pilot’s license, or to whom we have been married for three-and-a-half years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should try to see irritability for what it actually is: a confused, inarticulate, often shameful attempt to get us to understand how much someone is suffering and how urgently they need our help. We should – when we can manage it – attempt to help them out.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Melancholy is not exactly a word on everybody’s lips. People don’t go around gossiping about how melancholic the new regional IT director is or drawing up lists of the more melancholy-inducing bits of natural scenery (Brighton Beach on an overcast morning; Rannoch Moor in Scotland; the West Siberian Plain). But we should pay more attention to melancholy and even seek it out from time to time.</p>

<p class="p2">Melancholy is a species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult and that suffering and disappointment are core parts of universal experience. It’s not a disorder that needs to be cured. Modern society tends to emphasise buoyancy and cheerfulness. But we have to admit that reality is for the most part about grief and loss. The good life is not one immune to sadness, but one in which suffering contributes to our development. Sometimes you feel sad and you can’t quite put your finger on why. It’s not one acute sorrow that’s eating you. You feel in a way the whole of life calls for tears.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Melancholy is a key mental state and a valuable one, because it links pain with beauty and wisdom. Our suffering isn’t merely chaotic – a mark of failure, an error – it can be linked to admirable things. Often, sadness simply makes a lot of sense. </span>We feel melancholy when we consider that the things we love are transient. Yesterday will never come back. Every day you take a step nearer to death. The people who cared for us when we were young are getting older. We’ll be following their path to decline soon enough.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one truly understands anyone else, loneliness is basic, universal. Every life has its full measure of shame and sorrow. We spend our lives striving for things we mostly don’t get – and if we do, we are soon disappointed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4009625102_4c21c3b500_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8908" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/4009625102_4c21c3b500_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4009625102_4c21c3b500_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<h5 class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">They’ll grow up; they’ll encounter money worries, the difficulty of making a career, addictions, political conflict, illnesses and relationship frustrations.</span></strong></em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ultimately, nothing we do matters. Our lives – our loves and cares, our griefs, our triumphs – will be washed away.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3204" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/138054074410.jpg" alt="138054074410" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Hiroshi Sugimoto, North Atlantic Ocean, Cliffs of Moher, 1989: </span>Regrets</em></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All the things you should have said to your grandmother before she died. We learn too late. You have wasted years. Everyone has. You can only avoid regret by switching off your imagination, by refusing to consider how things might have been.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Many of the things we most want are in conflict: to feel secure, and yet to be free; to have money and yet not to have to be wage slaves. To be in close knit communities and yet not to be stifled by the expectations and demands of others. To travel and explore the world and yet to put down deep roots. To fulfil the demands of our appetites for food, drink, sex and lying on the sofa – and yet stay thin, sober, faithful and fit.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wisdom of the melancholy attitude (as opposed to the bitter or angry one) lies in the understanding that the sorrow isn’t just about you, that you have not been singled out, that your suffering belongs to humanity in general. So often our sorrows are egocentric. We see them as special misfortunes which have come our way. Melancholy rejects this. It has a wider, much less personal take. Much of what is painful and sorrowful in our lives can be traced to general things about life: its brevity; the fact that we cannot avoid missing opportunities, the contradictions of desire and self-management. These apply to everyone. So melancholy is generous. You feel this sorrow for others too, for ‘us’. You feel pity for the human condition.</span></p>
<p class="p2">And feeling such pity makes us better people. It offers to make our expectations of human conduct more accurate. Whoever I am with will suffer the same broad difficulties. It is hardly surprising if they go off the rails, get frazzled, lie from time to time, change their minds for no good reason (or refuse to change their minds when there is good reason). We are melancholy when we grasp that there are deep troubles essentially bound up with being human. And to take that fully to heart is to become more compassionate.</p>

</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Religions have been advocates of melancholy. The Christian Book of Common Prayer gives a statement to be recited at funerals:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down, like a flower. In the midst of life we are in death.</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s intended to strike home a universal, melancholy thought. At the funeral of a loved one we are not just witnessing the passing of one life. We are invited to see each other – and ourselves – as dying animals. This should not make us desperate, but rather more forgiving, kinder and better able to focus on what really matters, while there is still time.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Not least, melancholy is attractive. There are many types of beauty and many ways of being sexy. But at certain periods of history some major possibilities get neglected. Our age is prone to overlook one of the central sources of sexual allure. Melancholy sexiness goes beneath today’s radar because we’re dominated by the idea that to attract the world, to give the world what it wants from us, we have to exude good cheer. But consider some of the following:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is easy, recklessly easy, to get ambitious about happiness; to imagine more fulfilling work, a more satisfying relationship, greater wealth, kinder friends. And then to get sad, because none of that is easy.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But there is one source of solace, delight and satisfaction that is available in almost every household across the developed world; something we have unproblematic and immediate access to, at minimal cost.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1749" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathA.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s best when, at first, the water is almost too hot. You venture a foot, then dare yourself to go further and, wincing at the pain, gradually let the water take your whole weight. For the first time today, you don’t have to support yourself anymore, you can at last escape the oppressive force of gravity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind this apparently simple moment, there lie the unheralded efforts of hundreds of thousands of unseen, and now mostly dead, others. Reservoirs were built for this and perhaps dams too, high upstream, stemming the rebellious force of wayward rivers. Gnarled hands laboured to lay the pipes that run like a vascular system underneath the skin of streets to reach the tap that now drips an occasional haunting tear into the steaming water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure is in part psychological. What is ‘outside’ is normally dispiritingly hostile. We have to swaddle our skin in careful layers of wool and cotton – and at night, encase ourselves within sheets and duvets.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1750" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathB.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, suddenly, in the bath, like on a very warm summer’s day, none of that is necessary any longer: the outside environment loses its bite. We feel at home in the world, able to take on the outside and win. We can be out there, naked, open, exposed and yet still at ease and warm. The bath emboldens us. There must be echoes in all this of those early quiet months when we first floated in warm water, kicking our legs this way and that, without too many cares. The bath offers a brief instance of reprieve for the pain that must have set in that notorious, traumatic, now-forgotten day (which later on, we’re brave about and ‘celebrate’ as our birthday) when, with a frightening swoosh and a draining of that reassuring liquid, we first emerged into the world – and nothing was ever quite as comfortable again.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Baths are ideal places to think. If we measured them simply on the basis of how many productive ideas we have there, they’d have more right to be called our offices than our offices. Our thoughts generally don’t come when commanded. They run out only when we’re not quite looking, like shy deer – and so they make a dash when we’re daydreaming in a train or letting our minds go fallow in the clear water.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1751" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathC.jpg" alt="PM-100314-bathC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Religions have long understood the significance of bathing: they send us into water for the big moments, the so-called ‘watersheds’, to turn over a new leaf, to start afresh, to have another chance. There often remains an echo of those grand ambitions behind our decision to go up and have a bath at the end of an evening. We’re not just looking to get clean. We’re trying to move on from the painful, offensive aspects of the day. We’re hoping the trauma will dissolve and gently loosen itself from us in the water.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most of our problems require awkwardly large solutions to stand any chance of being put right. Too often, that then leads us to overlook the passing vital consoling force of more modest consolations that lie to hand, like a hug, or its aquatic sibling, a bath.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1752" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-100314-bathD.jpg" alt="1516221a" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We tend to reproach ourselves for staring out of the window. You are supposed to be working, or studying, or ticking off things on your to-do list. It can seem almost the definition of wasted time. It seems to produce nothing, to serve no purpose. We equate it with boredom, distraction, futility. The act of cupping your chin in your hands near a pane of glass and letting your eyes drift in the middle distance does not normally enjoy high prestige. We don’t go around saying: ‘I had a great day: the high point was staring out of the window’. But maybe in a better society, that’s just the sort of thing people would say to one another.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/G._Caillebotte_-_Jeune_homme_%C3%A0_la_fen%C3%AAtre.jpg" alt="" width="483" height="706" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Gustave Caillebotte, Young Man at His Window, 1875: Seeking to bring glamour and higher status to an activity which, for centuries has been condemned and denigrated by moralists, teachers, employers, parents – and our own guilty consciences.</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The point of staring out of a window is, paradoxically, not to find out what is going on outside. It is, rather, an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds. It’s easy to imagine we know what we think, what we feel and what’s going on in our heads. But we rarely do entirely. There’s a huge amount of what makes us who we are that circulates unexplored and unused. Its potential lies untapped. It is shy and doesn’t emerge under the pressure of direct questioning. If we do it right, staring out the window offers a way for us to listen out for the quieter suggestions and perspectives of our deeper selves.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1737" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Rex_PLANE_2982331A.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1">Plato suggested a metaphor for the mind: our ideas are like birds fluttering around in the aviary of our brains. But in order for the birds to settle, Plato understood that we needed periods of purpose-free calm. Staring out the window offers such an opportunity. We see the world going on: a patch of weeds is holding its own against the wind; a grey tower block looms through the drizzle. But we don’t need to respond; we have no overarching intentions, and so the more tentative parts of ourselves have a chance to be heard, like the sound of church bells in the city once the traffic has died down at night.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1739" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/4617517731.jpg" alt="A young woman listening to a record player" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1">Remembering neglected parts of herself  </span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The potential of daydreaming isn’t recognised by societies obsessed with productivity. But some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful and instead respect the creative potential of reverie. Window daydreaming is a strategic rebellion against the excessive demands of immediate (but ultimately insignificant) pressures – in favour of the diffuse, but very serious, search for the wisdom of the unexplored deep self.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1740" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/868713951.jpg" alt="President Barack Obama" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is, of course, a form of madness. You pick up the largest jam jar and fling it to the floor. You go up to the attendant at the counter and deliver a stream of obscenities. You accelerate and overtake on a narrow country lane bordered by oak trees.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However insane these moments seem, it is not right to dismiss them as merely beyond understanding. They operate according to an underlying rationale which needs to be grasped for anger to be controlled and extinguished.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anger begins with the many imperfections of existence: the internet connection has failed, the plane is delayed again, someone is driving too slowly. It is fair enough to take a negative view of these things. But in order for them to make us angry – rather than merely sad – there is something else at work: we break, kick, slam and accelerate because we are, at some level, horribly optimistic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2344" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/55318275.jpg" alt="Protestors Rally In Support Of Katrina Evacuees At White House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though the angry may seem negatively predisposed to life, they are in their hearts recklessly hopeful. Recklessly because how badly we react to frustration is critically determined by what we think of as normal. We may be irritated that it is raining, but our pessimistic accommodation to the likelihood of showers means we are unlikely ever to respond to one by screaming. Our annoyance is tempered by what we understand we can expect from the climate, by our melancholy experience of what it is normal to hope for from the skies. We aren’t overwhelmed by anger whenever we don’t get something we want; we do so only when we first believed ourselves fundamentally entitled to secure it – and then oddly did not. Our greatest furies spring from events which violate our sense of the ground-rules of existence.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141555142.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4153" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/141555142.jpg?resize=635%2C455" alt="Trilussa Observing A Bicycle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The angry are hence operating with the wrong sense of what is normal: the person who shouts every time they lose their house keys betrays a faith, touching were it not so counter-productive, that their belongings should simply never go astray. The person who loses their temper when stuck behind a slow driver evinces a curious (were it not so dangerous) belief that country roads should always be mysteriously traffic-free.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So calm has to begin with pessimism. We must learn to disappoint ourselves at leisure before the world has a chance to slap us by surprise, when our defences are down. The angry must be systematically inducted to the darkest realities of life, to the stupidities of others, to the ineluctable failings of technology, to the necessary flaws of infrastructure… – all this while there is still time. They should start each day with a short but thorough meditation on the many humiliations and insults to which the coming hours risk subsequently subjecting them, from a car accident to the accidental destruction of the hard-drive.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The angry are, also, deeply scared. They may seem bullishly confident in their rage, but they are smashing things up out of panic. They have no faith in their own capacity to survive frustration and recover equanimity despite some perhaps truly significant losses. They lack a resilient sense of how – with sufficient patience, love and time – error and damage may be repaired, borne and overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2346" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/50968742.jpg" alt="Personnel Problems" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This mixture of hope and fear reaches its apogee in the fury witnessed in relationships. Partners who might have been deeply patient with people all day, who may have dealt politely with the flaws of multiple colleagues and clients, will lose their tempers in volcanic ways when faced with the minor failings of their beloveds (‘How was your day?’ asked a little too dismissively perhaps). Behind the rage is a combustible mixture of hope – ‘this is the person who is meant to understand me’ – and fear; that one has settled down with the wrong human being, and has therefore ruined one’s life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Behind their outbursts, the angry are trying to teach the world things: how to run an airline, how to drive, how to make decent dinner-time conversation… However, they are exceptionally bad teachers because too much is at stake for them. They lack the basic psychological resource of good teachers: a relative indifference to the success or failure of their lessons.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We tend to laugh at the angry (when we are not terrified of their blows). But when we can manage it, we should bear in mind that their anger is grounded in attitudes and hopes that may deserve sympathy rather than just scorn. The bulging eyes, the raised voices and the harsh phrases occur when an intense sense of justice and urgent practical energy meet the conviction (in fragile and vulnerable beings) that they will not be understood or listened to if they try to explain their disappointments.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Given what has caused the outburst in the first place, to calm down the angry person tends only ever to require three things: a ready declaration that we too are extremely disappointed, a sympathetic insistence that we so wish it could be otherwise and a magnanimous and convincingly-delivered assurance that we are truly sure they will get through this.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s normal to think that what makes people cry are sad things; that’s certainly the way it works when you’re a child. But the older one gets, the more one starts to notice a strange phenomenon: one starts crying not when things are horrible (one toughens up a little), but when they are suddenly and unexpectedly precisely the opposite, when they are unusually sweet, tender, joyful, innocent or kind. This, far more than grimness, is what may increasingly prompt tears.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You notice this particularly with films. The scenes that make us weep are not necessarily the harrowing or terrifying ones, but the ones when we encounter a particular grace and loveliness which can, for a moment, feel heartbreaking. Take Richard Linklater’s recent film,<em> Before Midnight</em>. Most of the film is about bitter arguments between a 40-something couple, played by Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke. They have been together for years, they are on holiday in Greece, and the film homes in on one day when the pair go and spend some supposed ‘quality time’ alone in a smart hotel. They arrive in their room with the possibility of sex somewhere in both of their minds but instead, find themselves having a blazing argument. They rake up all the hurt from past years; they blame each other for every disappointment and swear at, and insult, one other with abandon.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2508" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryA.jpg" alt="BEFORE MIDNIGHT - Jan 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“Find someone else to put up with your shit. You’re fucking awful to be with, you know”</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2509" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryB.png" alt="PM-200314-cryB" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“I don’t love you anymore. I hate you, you’ve ruined my whole fucking life”</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Eventually, the wife storms out, leaving her room key and her husband behind. It is agonisingly real (how does the film maker know this about our lives?). But, after a few hours of sulking, Hawke goes out in search of Delpy and finds her alone in a nearby restaurant terrace. They are both a little sheepish around each other, as one often is after a row, and he sits down opposite her with poignant formality.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a beautiful closing sequence, they start to talk with unusual honesty. It’s difficult, but we can see that, despite everything (kids, too many sacrifices, exhaustion, not enough sex, perhaps a one-night stand or two) they do still love and desire each other very much. Their rage is an explosion of the frustration inherent within all long-term relationships. They get so deeply upset because they know that, day to day, they need so much from one another and they don’t always get it. They’re not magically going to stop bickering in the future. But this moment of kindness and sympathy, playfulness and gentleness, after such a bruising confrontation, comes as a huge relief and is deeply tender to behold. Their admission of shared love is moving because it reminds us at once of the struggles in our own lives and of what at heart we really want: reconciliation, forgiveness, tenderness, an end to the fighting, a chance to say sorry… We start to cry at a brief vision of a state of grace from which we’re exiled most of the time.</span></p>
<h5 class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2510" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-200314-cryC.jpg" alt="Before Midnight - Feb 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m sorry. We both are. You drive me crazy, but I love you like I always did”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take another example from another medium and from further back in history: a small ivory statuette of the Virgin and Child – it is just 41 cm high – in the Louvre in Paris, dating from about 1250.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200314-cryD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4155" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-200314-cryD.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="PM-200314-cryD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most striking feature is the mother’s face: one of welcome and joy; the kind of look we hope to receive when someone is unreservedly glad to see us. Mary’s charm and kindness may give rise to poignant emotions. We feel this is how life should be, this is what love looks like and what we should be giving to one another. But at the same time, we know it’s not easy; we’re pained by an acute sense that our lives are not usually like this. We may ache for all the lost innocence of the world (and of our own lives). Loveliness and goodness in art (at the Louvre, or in a children’s book, or on a screen) can make the actual ugliness of existence all the more vivid. And that’s precisely why we cry at this poignant reminder of an elusive paradise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s also why, if we were to consider the unusual project of creating a robot that could cry in films, with books or at the museum, we should have to do something apparently rather cruel: we would have to ensure that this robot knew about suffering, that it was able to hate itself, to feel confused and frustrated, to ache and hope that it didn’t have to ache; for it is against this kind of background of pain and sober maturity that beautiful scenes in films or works of art become deeply important, rather than merely nice. Our tears are telling us something key: that our lives are tougher than they used to be when we were little, and that our longing for uncomplicated niceness and goodness is correspondingly all the more intense.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling grateful about the good aspects of our lives is something we all know we should do a bit more often. And yet there’s often something curiously uncomfortable, even maddening, about being reminded to do so.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In part, that’s because the call to be more grateful stands in deep conflict with a central drive in human nature: ambition. We know in theory that we should be grateful for what we have, but day to day, we are dominated by striving: for better relationships, working lives, communities and nations. The advocates of gratitude sound like they are recommending that we be content with how things already are. Mediocre situations could (these people seem to be saying) be so much worse. People in developed nations, irritated by the ineptitudes of their governments, should be more grateful that their politicians are not like those in Zimbabwe. Someone fed up with having a cough should be very glad they don’t have bronchitis…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2361" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141759341.jpg" alt="Londoners Enjoy Spring Sunshine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Don’t remind me to be grateful</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sort of thinking is deeply at odds with the underlying attitudes of modern societies. Capitalism stimulates constant ambition and longing and rewards astute, intense assaults on excellence. Restlessness is the precondition of progress. Nothing should be good enough for very long. The idea of being content with what we have and who we are has come to feel strange and dangerous. At best, gratitude appears like the consolation prize – the loser’s counsel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, encouragement to be ‘grateful’ is not always the kindly act it seems. It may just be another person’s convenient way of disguising their fear of competition or their refusal to engage with the stress and turmoil of aspiration. The insistence that we be more grateful could just be a jealous friend’s way of sidestepping our anxieties while ennobling their lack of effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it is so deeply important to hear exhortations to be grateful – to appreciate what we have and to recognise the value of simple, natural things – from people who understand a lot about striving and effort and who have not fallen into gratitude simply from a lack of initiative or strength. To trust the message, we have to trust the motives, experiences and character of the person telling us to be grateful – just as the reminder to be faithful in love gains weight when it comes from someone who has had every option to explore multiple partners. To be convincing, gratitude needs to be in a constructive dialectical relationship with aspiration. The call to gratitude isn’t for everyone at all times. It is a corrective for those among us who are in danger of overplaying ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4112" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel.jpg?resize=624%2C480" alt="Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman Emperor and philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, was a most convincing guide to gratitude  &#8211; because he knew so much about power and success. We therefore take note when he points out that we should be deeply grateful for a sunny day, a tasty piece of fruit and a summer evening when it’s warm enough to sit outside without extra layers. In his hands, we recognise that gratitude does not have to be a polite way of opting out of ambition.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is equally important to know that the advocates of gratitude aren’t merely being naïve when they tell us to stop and appreciate flowers or a pretty sky; they know about suffering and darkness and are speaking up only because they have been to hell and back and concluded that in the end, what makes the journey worth it are a few outwardly humble but deeply significant things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we grow ungrateful in the first place? Fear may have something to do it. There is in many of us a fear of enjoying the present moment – as if to pause to appreciate a flower or the rapid movement of clouds over the horizon might make us ‘soft’ and leave us open to fatal complacency and grievously sap our will to take on bigger challenges. We are prone to make an odd and deeply unfortunate connection between safety and a mood of anxious dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our mood is also frequently affected by who and what we are implicitly comparing ourselves with. And though we’re not generally clear what our comparison points are (we build them up unconsciously and don’t take the opportunity to question them often enough), we are prone to comparisons that are deeply unfair to our achievements and strengths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of the problem comes down to our images of what is ‘normal’ – distributed through society by the media. Take someone who might be deeply dissatisfied with their appearance on the basis of the models they have seen. But the beauty of models is as rare as the violence of mass murderers. The problem is, we tend to think there are far more murders than there are. Three stories of stabbings in a week make it feel as if everyone is knifing everyone else. We have to remind ourselves that, though people do get stabbed and some have perfect faces, these things are extraordinarily rare. We recognise symptoms of panic when the frequency of bad things is exaggerated. We don’t yet recognise the dissatisfaction that arises when the frequency of very attractive things (superlative relationships, careers, bodies) is overplayed. We grow ungrateful because we are, among other things, very poor statisticians.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4116" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonB.jpg?resize=635%2C386" alt="Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looking fashionable while out and about in NYC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not normal at all</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to fight images of false glamour, to throw the spotlight on people, scenes and activities which deserve far more prestige than they are currently given. Of course, it can be hard to see beauty and interest in the things we have to do everyday and in the environments where we live. We have jobs to go to, bills to pay, homes to clean and keep running and we deeply resent the demands they make on us. They seem to be pulling us away from our real ambitions, getting in the way of a better life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art, and art galleries, seem far away from all this: they are for a day off, somewhere to visit on holiday. But art can occasionally usefully remind us that the circumstances of our lives are not as discredited and uninteresting as we are used to thinking. Art can be a prime agent of gratitude, a corrective of false glamour, when we learn to look at our world as certain great artists have looked at theirs. Take the Dutch 17th-century painter Pieter de Hooch, an artist deeply alive to the value of simple moments of domestic life, of the kind most of us know from our own routines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-110314-houseworkA2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4118" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-110314-houseworkA2.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="PM-110314-houseworkA2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We have been in similar situations before, by the washing machine, without gratitude</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The linen closet itself could easily be resented. It is an embodiment of what could, under an unhelpful influence, be seen as boring, banal, repetitive… But the picture moves us because we recognise the truth of its message. If only, like de Hooch, we knew how to recognise the value of quiet domesticity, many of our burdens would be lifted. It gives voice to the right attitude: the big themes of life – the search for prosperity, happiness, good relationships – start with the way we approach little things. It’s a hard message to hold on to, because we are constantly being told other things. This painting is small in a competitive, status-conscious world – but that many people revere it is hopeful, for it signals that we know, deep down, that de Hooch is onto something important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2368" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/T12219_10.jpg" alt="A View from an Apartment 2004-5 by Jeff Wall born 1946" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A View from an Apartment 2004-5 by Jeff Wall born 1946</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Canadian photographer Jeff Wall, like Pieter de Hooch several centuries before, is alive to the charm of an ordinary day, hanging out at home, sorting stuff out. Here too there are reasons for gratitude</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To say that we should be more grateful is not to deny a role for future effort. It is to recognise that there are already at this point some very good reasons to be a little more satisfied with who we are and what we have. A failure to draw pleasure from our current circumstances is an indication of a problem which will likely dog us even if we reach the pinnacle of all our ambitions. Our problem is not not having enough: it is not daring to relax our guard long enough to draw pleasure from any advantage per se.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/169021616.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4996" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/169021616.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="Tour of California - Stage 7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The ultimate road to gratitude</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a flexibility about how we tell our stories. It isn’t just one thing that has ever happened to us, there are different angles from which we might come at the same material (what we call being depressed is, at heart, an inability to alter our narrative methods). Compared with some ideals of success, our lives have of course invariably been disasters. We made some serious errors, we lacked courage, we were lazy, we unwittingly upset important people, we messed up… But it is in the end no great achievement simply to locate and fixate on failure. There should be prestige too in being able to identify a forgiving, hopeful perspective; in knowing how to be a friend to oneself. We need moments of gratitude because our greatest responsibility is to endure; to identify reasons not to end it prematurely when it might at first glance make so much sense to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ultimate corrective is to compare oneself with the dead. By that final standard, so many aspects of life are to be cherished, even what we now consider imperfections. We are constantly undermined by our failure to retain the purity and drama of that insight – which might strike us at a funeral or when driving past a smash up on the motorway – and put it to powerful use in the ordinary bustle of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is by redrawing our unconscious frames of comparison more accurately that our lives start to appear in a more benign, and more valuable, light. Gratitude is the dividend that is due to us when we forego false images of normality and begin to assess our lives against stark but liberating statistical realities.</p>

Their story will be ours, an idea that today still remains almost impossible to admit to ourselves or to pay due homage to, through the rounds of ordinary distractions and commitments. We seem, day to day, simply so eternal, unfortunately for us…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dying have momentous things to say to all of us, even when they say them in simple unschooled words. Their pronouncements become like those of prophets; they have gone ahead of us to tell us the truths we don’t have the courage for right now. These men and women, none of whom have more than a few days left to live, speak with the clarity, the lack of pretension, the utter sincerity of the damned.</span></p>

<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Abel: “You have a one way ticket, don’t waste it!”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dying are the great appreciators of this world: they notice the sunshine on the roller blind, the laughter of a grandchild, another breath… And they know what spoilt ingrates we all are, not stopping to register the wonder of every passing minute. They were once like us of course. They know they wasted decades and from their beds, they strive to tell us of their folly and warn us of our own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1770" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/y2sPhR86mbUaUVtjehn0haUHsgZbjGg9dqFkjEuF-HQvL8JAQL0ObUv86vjjq11tKNAsPs2YKt6EJ52ORRKZVc.jpg" alt="y2sPhR86mbUaUVtjehn0haUHsgZbjGg9dqFkjEuF-HQvL8JAQL0ObUv86vjjq11tKNAsPs2YKt6EJ52ORRKZVc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Kim: “There’s so many things to enjoy and we don’t enjoy them.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the time for confession and for admissions of weakness. This is no occasion for pride. You can admit all the many things that went wrong, the evasions, cowardice, bitterness and betrayals that are the hidden mortar of every life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1771" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/e8U62N5Z4MI-y1j3GiUIPwM52srbhhTfHmHtpL7Yuoc.jpg" alt="e8U62N5Z4MI-y1j3GiUIPwM52srbhhTfHmHtpL7Yuoc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald: “Even though my ex-wife remarried and loved another man, I still love her.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The things that the dying cherish most have no connection with what is deemed important by the competitive world. Childhood is always mentioned, the time when death had no presence yet, when there were only nightmares that could be comforted away by a loving hand. Now the nightmares have colonised the days. This is worse than any ghost or zombie a childhood imagination could have dreamt up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1772" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/9wUqiwjOK6AB8ddrTkObk1gNSNuuFlMVTyZoayM9BaYXnesIpmxO3mNtBDgwSX_9bWBVZ2F-nS_6s4vJgrpmyg.jpg" alt="9wUqiwjOK6AB8ddrTkObk1gNSNuuFlMVTyZoayM9BaYXnesIpmxO3mNtBDgwSX_9bWBVZ2F-nS_6s4vJgrpmyg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Chuck: “Some of my favourite times were as kids; me and my brothers used to play baseball and my mom would join us.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may want to cry, for them and of course, as it should be, for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Death is the great re-organiser. It refashions ambition, it encourages us to attach new value to things we hardly would have thought of as goals of any kind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OJbyktiaHPnC3JlzQeREZQzmDFsdMfg4UgZ8FuL7PwkJ9VkM33zh7ZeS49BaV3y7MFXf3oIZG89hSCJ7JIrCwc-635x475.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="OJbyktiaHPnC3JlzQeREZQzmDFsdMfg4UgZ8FuL7PwkJ9VkM33zh7ZeS49BaV3y7MFXf3oIZG89hSCJ7JIrCwc-635x475" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Irene: “I would love to be seventy years old.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will leave very few traces. Our monuments are shockingly small, but all the more genuine and heartbreaking for being so. We can count ourselves lucky for living on in the hearts of a few for half a decade or so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1774" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2tf7t6FWvKggn2e8gafeKgA3WHutYMNGYZahStMwEjY6AuqaSZvSZwlSLGfxCqQuQcUl-SLLCLNKgZptX4Ijl8-635x475.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="2tf7t6FWvKggn2e8gafeKgA3WHutYMNGYZahStMwEjY6AuqaSZvSZwlSLGfxCqQuQcUl-SLLCLNKgZptX4Ijl8-635x475" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Odis: “I’ll be remembered for my red beet jam and quilting…”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every age should be in search of effective ways to keep death in mind. Once we would look at skulls or at martyrs, hourglasses or withered flowers. Now we can accompany a photographer down the linoleum departure gates of the dying. The task of art is to give us access to experiences it is otherwise hard to get hold of and to render their moral vivid to our distracted imaginations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The images are desperately sad but not necessarily depressing. Rather than try to crush us with the remembrance of death, they are on the side of life, they give us new determination to make sure the coming days are not wasted like so many others have been.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It no longer matters quite so much whom we squabbled with and what our anxieties may currently be about. With death in mind, we are set free from things that shouldn’t constrain us in the first place: our fears, wrong preoccupations, false values.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we’re likely to forget the wisdom on offer here within hours. We’ll be back to losing perspective – and overlooking the sunlight and the charm of the breeze. These are the sort of ungrateful minds we all have – which is why we continuously need the resources of art to renew our connection with the unbearable but deeply necessary truths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The images were taken by Andrew George: <a href="http://www.rightbeforeidie.com/" target="_blank">www.rightbeforeidie.com</a>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most weeks, someone mistreats us in a greater or lesser way: they overlook a commitment they’ve made, they let us down logistically, they betray our hopes or deceive our trust. And on a macro scale, similarly sombre dynamics play themselves out on the public stage: politicians act dishonourably, business leaders plunder and fool us, the young show no respect, and criminals bully and terrify the vulnerable.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2351" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-resize-1.jpg" alt="PA-resize-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many good reasons to settle into an unforgiving mood. For a start, most of the bad things we see are so far removed from anything we could ever contemplate doing, it feels like there is simply no point attempting to understand or to empathise with the wrongdoers. We shake our heads and wonder how some people get to be the way they are. We use words like weirdo and pervert. The conclusion is that these people must just be ‘bad’ and that it is a delusion of the liberal mind to insist on anything more complex. Furthermore, forgiving enemies, though it looks charitable, appears to be the last resort of the weak, something one tries to do when a lack of will power has left one with no other option but to look past the offences of our enemies. A certain bullish unforgiving attitude promises protection against chaos and social disintegration. A civilisation cannot survive too much softness towards evil.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2353" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144823765.jpg" alt="Protests Continue In Chicago On Eve Of NATO Summit" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in the end, a lack of forgiveness is a mood, a filter we apply to reality, and like most moods, it needs regular audiences with its opposite – and because forgiveness is ultimately the harder of the pair, the one that comes least naturally to all of us, it is the emotion that calls for most attention: it is the one we need consciously to exercise and rehearse, as we would the flexing of an underused muscle. We should do so because we cannot sustain relationships or working lives or be members of a community and the carers of children without regularly being able to draw on significant reserves of forgiveness. Not getting bitter, not seeking revenge, not telling others everything on one’s mind, not trying to get equal even when one has every right to do so; these constructive moves need all the support and encouragement a society can muster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path to forgiveness always begins in the same place: with the recognition of one’s own sinful nature. Certainly one may never have done this or that truly dreadful thing upon which one’s sense of outrage currently rests. But, so the forgiving attitude insists, one has done something, indeed many things that are on a continuum with, or in some ways related to, the horrors one is currently condemning with force. One might never have cheated on a tax form, physically hurt anyone or directly stolen someone’s property, but one has – inevitably – told lies and hurt, deceived and humiliated, bullied and evaded; one has been guilty of a thousand everyday sins endemic to us all. A clean conscience is only a possibility for the callously unimaginative. To get by, we all need to rely on the forgiveness of countless others – ex-partners, parents, colleagues, friends – people who did not at a variety of moments exact the full revenge that might have been their due. Our survival is predicated on a great many others having – at key moments – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To adopt a forgiving attitude involves going beyond a pat belief in purely ‘evil’ motives. The very category of evil fragments awkwardly upon closer examination. What we call evil invariably reveals origins in hurt, weakness, tiredness, madness, desperation and folly. Understood fully, we are always more demented than bad. The furious, swearing father isn’t a monster; he is someone who did not gain sufficient reassurance in childhood, who is carrying untold anxieties from work, who is exhausted, who is a fool and who in his calmer moments, harbours a capacity to be deeply ashamed of his short temper and appalled at having damaged those he loves. Empathy towards the perpetrator doesn’t entail that one has for even a moment forgotten the victim, simply that one is committed to doing justice to psychological reality. The roots of awful behaviour lie – far more often than the unforgiving can admit – in terror and anxiety. Faced with the antics of our species, one should be moved more to profound pity than to indignation, more to sorrow than to fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2354" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/81195132.jpg" alt="Children play on a swing set on a summer day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know how to practise this attitude, for we already do it all the time quite naturally with children. Faced with an example of a child’s violence or unreason, we know to ask at once whether they are tired or have eaten enough, whether they are worried or are being hurt by someone else. We don’t need to learn the lessons of forgiveness from scratch, we need merely to expand the range of people to whom we are willing to apply them. At moments of tension in domestic life, we should take a moment to think of those pictures of one’s partner as a six-year-old, perhaps on a swing in the garden or waiting with a nervous smile outside school. It becomes harder, crucially harder, to be outraged and miffed by their present conduct once one has been reminded of where this person began.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also helps to recognise that forgiveness is not just the recourse of the weak. It reaches its most admirable and moving form precisely when it manifests itself in the strong, when it is recognised as a sign of maturity and inner confidence, a symptom of greatness of heart and sanity of mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forgiveness deserves glamour. Religions once knew this. Buddhism, Judaism and Christianity all sought in different ways to induce and reinforce our tentative inclinations to forgiveness. The poetry read out in synagogue on the Jewish Day of Atonement, the song cycles of Eastern Buddhism, the tender melancholy of Bach’s St John’s Passion, these were meant to fill the hearts of their audiences with compassion for the follies of humankind. If we now seldom feel moved to forgiveness, we should recognise what a gap the disappearance of religion from public life has created and what help we may need from the surrounding culture to access the most constructive parts of our own nature. We need our tentative propensity to forgiveness to be publicly endorsed and rehearsed – not least in art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2355" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Entrega_de_las_llaves_a_San_Pedro_Perugino.jpg" alt="640px-Entrega_de_las_llaves_a_San_Pedro_Perugino" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is often a fear that to forgive is to risk the good order of society. But in reality, if one always seeks to extract full justice, civilisation (and, at a more minor level, marriages, relationships, friendships and business ties) will not be able to continue. History shows that well-functioning societies require heroic moves of forgiveness on the part of groups that have been horribly wronged, in order that life can progress and other matters attended to. One needs to learn the art of overlooking, the genius of pretending not to have noticed. It means giving mean people too great a role in life never to forgive them, it allows them to hold our minds indefinitely hostage to their sadism. It allows the enemy to win. Forgiveness constitutes the true victory over the bad and is the ultimate marker of strength and courage.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Frustration with one’s appearance is an embarrassing – but, in truth, highly serious and valid – pain. Mature, reasonable people are not supposed to go around regretting their nose or hair. Yet you gaze in the bathroom mirror and think: why – in my brief existence on this planet – does that have to be me?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those unhappy with their looks, pictures are painful. Each new image brings more bad news. The worries are not trivial because personal appearance is a major currency of status. In a world where we are constantly interacting with strangers (who have little to go on but our bodies) nice treatment goes to the pretty first. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/97205210.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4176" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/97205210.jpg?resize=416%2C430" alt="Tyrone Power" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can’t prevent being highly visual creatures. In seconds, we draw out huge novelistic character assessments from minute details. And other people are doing this to us – a disaster given how most of us have so much more to offer on the inside than on the outside. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To face the challenges, we need to develop a particular kind of wisdom. Here is a start to learning how to cope with one’s looks.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">One: It’s not personal</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2">Instinctively we feel that being judged on our appearance is a wrong directed specifically at us as individuals. But we have to accept with Stoic good grace that personal appearance simply is one of the least democratic parts of life: preferring good looks over average ones is like preferring a sunny day to an overcast one. The cause is universal, natural and impersonal. It’s not you…</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4822715071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4179" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4822715071.jpg?resize=635%2C439" alt="A woman looking at herself in the mirror of a bathroom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Two: Let your disappointment feed your love of beauty</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Appreciation tends to be stimulated by lack. When Baudelaire wrote his ode, La Chevelure (Hair), his praise was all the more intense, his love all the more poignant because he was rapidly balding, much to his distress. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">O fleecy hair, falling in curls to the shoulders! </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">O black locks! O perfume laden with nonchalance! </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">Ecstasy! To people the dark alcove tonight </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">With memories sleeping in that thick head of hair. </span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><em><span class="s1">I would like to shake it in the air like a scarf!</span></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the ugly who are best placed to appreciate beauty, something the beautiful should surely bear in mind, when they are considering upon whom to bestow their favours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/713px-Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4181" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/713px-Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862.jpg?resize=635%2C510" alt="713px-Étienne_Carjat_Portrait_of_Charles_Baudelaire_circa_1862" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A man who is going to focus on the beauty of hair. Charles Baudelaire</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Three: Understand statistics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley can look even prettier walking down the street than modelling underwear. It’s not really normal to cope with this. We’re not adapted to handle such looks. In the past, we only had to compare ourselves with a small number of people in communities or tribes. Now the tribe has given way to the whole world. Our ideas of ‘good looks’ are being defined by an extraordinary, almost freakishly perfect elite. When we lived in small villages, we could believe we were, or lived with, the 10th most beautiful person around. That offered comfort. Now we’re daily reminded of our mediocrity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4183" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonA.jpg?resize=635%2C378" alt="Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looking fashionable while out and about in NYC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">We can’t easily unwind this kind of exposure. So we have to get better at understanding statistics. Rosie’s beauty is not normal. It is as rare as a mass murder. The problem is, we tend to think there are far more murders than there are. Three stories of stabbing in a week make it feel as if everyone is knifing everyone else. We wildly exaggerate how common certain things are.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We have to remind ourselves that though people do get stabbed and some have perfect faces, this is deeply unusual. Perhaps there were three stabbings – but there are 65 million people in the country. Rosie is beautiful, but her looks are those of around one in 100 million women.</span></p>
<p class="p2">We recognise symptoms of panic when the frequency of a bad thing is exaggerated. We don’t yet recognise a similar kind of hysteria that can occur when the frequency of a very attractive, good thing gets exaggerated.</p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Four: Rely on ugly parents</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Don’t assume you can know what everyone thinks of your looks. There will be exceptions, people who actually rather like the way you appear, even where it’s not perfect. The hotel receptionist might be enchanted by double chins; they might be deeply moved by podgy arms. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reason is simple. We learn about love from our parents, they provide the template for affection which we go on to apply to others when we are grown up. And fortunately for the ugly among us, many parents who are kind and loving are also not so beautiful. This means that many people, even very attractive ones, grow up predisposed to think very generously of not-so-perfect people. They were the ones who first looked after them and taught them about love: and they are the physical types with whom they may therefore continue to associate comfort, safety and tenderness.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3183" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/50722401.jpg" alt="Steve Buscemi [Family]" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Five: Follow the comic flow of envy and frustration</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The affluent guy in first class deeply envies the honed jaw of the cabin steward. The female CEO envies the wrists and hands of the intern. The prime minister is terrified of his receding hairline. This is beautifully humbling, levelling and democratic. Given that there will always be a class system, how nice that there should also be – alongside the feudal castes of money and power – another class system based on looks, in which the hierarchy is rearranged and a new elite established (here the shop assistant may be the boss…)</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3184" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/78595331.jpg" alt="French president Nicolas Sarkozy is refl" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Six: Be patient </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However unfair the distribution of appearance is today, time will – eventually – bring justice. No one ends up happy with how they look, it’s just a question of waiting. For some disenchantment may start at 10. For others it may take another 40 years. But it will happen for sure. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">Seven: Become a wise revolutionary</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rather than saying appearance doesn’t matter – which is trying to hold back the ocean – you can get better at noticing the less obvious but still real beauties of appearance. The trouble with our culture is not so much that we love appearances, but that we focus on too narrow a range of features and qualities. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Take action. Praise someone’s august forehead; note the melancholy sweetness of their eyes. Admire an expression of kindly acceptance; point out serenity; a trusting face, a candid nose… </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many good and attractive things we can see in people’s faces, if we are alert to different types of beauty. And hopefully someone, somewhere, will one day do the same for us. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Imagine a sunny day, one in which many people, on walking out of the house for the first time, will note a particular brightness to the light, and a balminess to the air, which may trigger a surge of hope and a willingness to look at familiar problems with renewed determination.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1815" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/summer1.jpg" alt="Hot weather in London, Britain - 19 Jun 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The pleasure that can be triggered by good weather is, at one level, absurd. Gratitude for the sun belongs to a category of satisfaction that feels humiliatingly simple. It’s tempting to deny the significance of the weather altogether – especially for philosophers – and to focus instead on more substantial political and economic issues, by which the course of our lives is overwhelmingly determined. We should surely be able to rise above minor frustrations like eleven days of rain and a persistent glacial wind from the north.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in reality, our behaviour reveals a devotion to a simple, even simplistic, truth: our faith in ourselves and our prospects is frequently determined by nothing grander than the number of photons of light in the sky and degrees of warmth in the air. Heat, pleasant breezes, intense sunlight and fresh flowers may play a critical role in encouraging us not to give up on things.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1816" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/summer2.jpg" alt="Weather Pics In Hyde Park... Sunbathers Making The Most Of The English Summer." data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being told that one’s view of life is – at a given moment – not the product of economic or moral conditions but of a lack of light (or indigestion or exhaustion) is from a certain angle intensely demeaning. There is an impulse to believe that our woes must be of a more weighty kind. Yet the truth is more subtle: to be happy, it seems we require some extremely large things (money, employment, freedom, love), but we also rely on a raft of peculiarly small things too. Babies know this second part of the equation very well, which is why it should never be an insult for someone to point out just how much we continue to have in common with these creatures.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Doubts about feeling pleased at a blue sky are ultimately a consequence of accidental snobbery. We may look down on a sunny scene which, if it were presented to us in a museum, we would take extremely seriously. If we went on a special trip to the Musee d’Orsay in Paris to see Monet’s paintings, we would hardly think we were doing something low-brow. Yet when we look at his beautiful <em>Wild Poppies, near Argenteuil</em> we are – in many respects – experiencing much the same thing as when we appreciate a spring scene on our way to work.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1817" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/monet.jpg" alt="monet" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s just that when a frame is put around an emotion, we are much more generous to it (and to ourselves) and appreciative of what it has to offer. Monet was a great artist in part because he knew how to draw our attention, and lend dignity to minor natural phenomena in danger of being overlooked in a heedless technocratic world.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If joy at fine weather is worrying to people of taste and intellectual sophistication, it is because of a fear that paying attention to pretty skies will mean one forgets the actual conditions of life: war, disease, poverty and political evil. But for most of us, the greatest risk we face is not in fact complacency; few of us are likely to be able to forget the human chaos for any length of time. Indeed, the real risk is not sentimental naivety; it is that we are going to fall into fury, despair and unshakeable depression.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is this eventuality that a sunny day is well suited to correct. Flowers in spring, blue skies, children running in the park… these are crucial symbols of hope. Scenes where no one is dying or suffering, where the air is warm, where there is an absence of sickness and in which everyday, quiet, ordinary contentment is glimpsed… this is anything but banal. Given the facts of life, cheerfulness is a phenomenal achievement – and the sunny days that occasionally lie behind it are bearers of their own particular and highly significant wisdom.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">No one, probably, has ever much doubted that these things are nice. Clouds, trees and streams represent nature in its most gentle, tranquil guise. Their appeal is instinctive. But we take them for granted. They form a pleasant background to other things: out of the plane window, we catch sight of a sea of clouds. Truly lovely – for a moment. Then the cabin crew come around with the sandwiches and you’ve found some episodes of <em>Mad Men</em> you’d missed. Your cousin’s wedding reception was in a garden of old oak trees, they were stunning – but that was two years ago, and you may not have looked properly at a tree since. There was that stream you used to love playing in as a child, damming up the flow till the water eventually protested and swept away your rocks. There must, theoretically, still be lots of streams. But the adult world is often decidedly stream-free.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is a lack of encouragement to focus on these natural elements. In a busy and remorselessly practical age, there are few explanations around as to what the point of such focus might be. And yet spending moments of close observation with clouds, trees and streams may in fact play a minor but important supporting role in the pursuit of a balanced and more or less sane life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CLOUDS </span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are preoccupied with ourselves in unhelpful ways. The clouds, however, are usefully indifferent to all our concerns. They don’t care about fashion. They are uninterested in gossip. They are not responsive to our status or lack of it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1726" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3595903a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are always close to these vast, quiet things. A grey tuft detaches itself in the break up of a great continental bank of cloud. It inches its way across the sky, slowly losing definition. Ten minutes later it is barely recognisable. And shortly after that, it merges with another cloud and its brief individual career is over. Islands of clouds form, make chains, nations, empires, then drift and dissolve – like a peaceful, silent, painless repetition of the turbulent mayhem of human history.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a constant drama above our heads: collisions, fractures, swirls, separations… Human life is no less active, but it can mean a moment of relief from our particular involvements to look up and be returned to a broader perspective, from where the agitations of the present moment will seem less significant – as they will for us too with time (even if we are incapable of holding on to this idea on most of the occasions we need it). It will all pass, even the current nastiness and enmities, like the clouds that seemed so fixed and heavy but an hour ago – and yet have now all moved on, leaving behind only two or three of their cohorts, apologetic and timid before the victorious sun, like the cowed remnants of a scattered army.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1727" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3337556a1.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><strong>TREES</strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are an image of patience, and resolution. Their gnarled, worn barks speak of the hundreds of seasons they have endured. They have bent and lost branches in November winds, they have been gnawed at by worms and beetles across the airless days of July, they have been knocked and hacked at by farmers and gardeners. But they endure – as we might better learn to do through their examples. It’s an unhelpful prejudice of the Western mind to think of philosophy as emanating only from books rather than, as the Eastern tradition more wisely points out, from the volumes of nature as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1728" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3749387a.jpg" alt="Nature" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2">Oak trees are an image of ordered complexity: the roots patiently draw nutrients from the soil, the capillaries of their trunks send water twenty-five metres upwards, each branch takes enough but not too much for the needs of its own leaves, each leaf contributes to the maintenance of the whole. The trees sit out rainy days without complaint, adjusting themselves to the slow shift of the seasons – showing no ill-temper in a storm, no desire to wander, with their many slender fingers deep in the clammy soil, metres from their central stems and far from the tallest leaves which hold rainwater in some 40,000 of their little palms.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The trees are an education in the cycle of life as well. All those leaves, resplendent in the summer sun, will be gone by the end of November. Human life is as unstoppable, but it may be through the abstract example of trees that we can come to accept the lesson with greater ease. Our own very disturbing experiences of change are recast in more universal terms. Our thinning hair, facial lines and the stiffening of our skin can be recast as a melancholy necessity rather than an unreasonable catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1729" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_3437458a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">STREAMS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Streams are always communicating: whispering, exclaiming, arguing (with a rock or twig), confiding (in a quiet vortex), dozing (in midsummer) or shouting (after a heavy shower).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1730" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/rexfeatures_1217115a.jpg" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like fires, they provide an ideal object of contemplation for us when we are trying to think. Their constant activity enlivens our imaginations. They don’t stare blankly back at us, like pieces of paper on a desk. They distract our minds just enough that the good ideas, the ones that hate to be asked directly to emerge, can feel relieved of pressure and slip out, while we’re following water as it rises gracefully to meet with the objections of a group of awkward rocks just below the surface. Streams warn us too that we must be careful to hold on to those thoughts, for our minds are no less fugitive than they are: we get an insight, but in a moment, it will be gone, like a twig in the current, unless we grab it at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1731" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/046.jpg" alt="046" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should not leave the encounter with clouds, trees or streams to chance alone. We would ideally have collective routines and events around them to edge us into good habits. Perhaps for a minute before lunch, we would ritually pause and look at the clouds – just as Christians have been encouraged to say a quick prayer of thanksgiving on sitting down to dinner. No week should be counted complete if it does not include three minutes given over to a tree. If streams are hard to come by, a picture of them should be a priority of interior decoration and each of us should make a point of stopping before a ‘stream-icon’ to reacquaint ourselves with its benign and beneficial moral.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We too easily lose touch with the better and saner aspects of ourselves. Somewhere inside us, we have the potential for calm and reason, tenderness and thoughtfulness. Clouds, trees and streams are on hand to help…</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2">On holiday in the Caribbean, Cameron Diaz has been undertaking philosophical experiments. She is investigating how middle-aged people can be happy without working, spending money or trying to have sex.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her experiments have been guided by the observation that small children are usually far happier than adults. One reason is that a child of six leaps around up to 3,000 times more a year than the average 46-year-old and, when doing so, frequently emits sounds of unrestrained joy like ahayhaaa and woohieeee. Can adults learn something from this? A Hollywood star investigates.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4157" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazA.jpg?resize=635%2C482" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Leaping</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In their forties, people almost never jump from small rocks into shallow water. It’s not at all necessary to do this outdoors, let alone in the Caribbean. A sofa or bed and a thick carpet work just as well. Maybe better in some ways. Getting the arms up in the air is crucial. When older people leap they tend to hold back and keep their arms down by their sides, or they do a half-hearted thing – kind of clenching their fists and keeping them near their chests. Unfortunately this reduces the pay-off quite a bit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4158" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazB.jpg?resize=635%2C500" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sand running</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Most adults look silly when they run in very soft sand. Your feet sink in so much it looks as if you are staggering. Which means we get reluctant to do it. But that’s a great pity because sand running is one of the surest ways of raising the spirits. The indoor version involves putting cushions and pillows in a line across a room and darting back and forth along them. Happiness can have some remarkably unintellectual, achievement-free foundations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazC-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4160" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazC-2.jpg?resize=635%2C416" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Splashing</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then there’s chest-splashing. Many adults find splashing of all kinds difficult. You worry about water getting in your eyes or onto something precious lying nearby. Cameron may have practised in the bath for a while.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4161" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-190314-diazD.jpg?resize=635%2C509" alt="EXCLUSIVE: **PREMIUM EXCLUSIVE RATES** Cameron Diaz showed of her amazing physique as she went skinny dipping with gal pals on a Caribbean getaway" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Selfie-ing</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for photos, you’d think there could be nothing simpler than taking a few of yourself and chuckling over the result. But over the age of forty it’s not so easy. You worry about how you look. The signs of ageing are always there. The inner critic is always saying – what’s happened to my chin? Does my mouth really look like that? Where did that wrinkle come from? It’s a real battle between fun and vanity. So often we try to control our appearance because we’re worried about what other people will think of us. It’s a kind of phobia. But by repeated exposure to slightly silly and disappointing pictures of yourself, you can actually get used to it. It bothers you less. You mature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cameron Diaz was not necessarily conscious of her own investigations into the sources of contentment.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All subjects have their specialised vocabularies; a set of words that initially sound unusual, even a touch frightening, but that can also prove oddly beautiful and beguiling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To their enemies, key words are mere jargon, but jargon has its advantages: it allows us swiftly to get a firm hold of ideas that might otherwise have been confusing and cumbersome. They also provide touching evidence of the existence of a group of people who have come together to agree on the meaning of some dauntingly fiddly things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Psychoanalysis has been very fruitful at generating a vocabulary. The subject provides a way of being interested in and helpful about intimate suffering. It suggests that self-knowledge is the only real route to making life less disappointing, frightening and confusing. Psychoanalysis admits that the causes of our loneliness and pain are not obvious and can sound strange. It is still common to be thought ill or mad for visiting an analyst. This is sad because analysis is ultimately interested in people getting better. Through analysis, we can lessen the grip of obsessions; we can reduce unproductive anxiety, and ultimately we can become a little more ready to love and cooperate. Psychoanalysis may prove to have been one of the twentieth century’s greatest inventions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3ac1c38bc66361c4782a18049ba884fa.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8888" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3ac1c38bc66361c4782a18049ba884fa.jpg?resize=635%2C318" alt="3ac1c38bc66361c4782a18049ba884fa" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><b>De</b><b>fence Mechanism</b></p>
<p class="p1">A DEFENCE MECHANISM is a way to save ourselves from mental anguish, by interpreting our own behaviour and that of other people in a way that affirms our self-love. We deny responsibility:<i> ‘It’s not my fault’</i>. We blame others: <i>‘You have been mean</i>’. Or we tell ourselves consoling lies: <i>‘I couldn’t help it’</i>. But if the cause of such behaviour is self-protection, then it cannot be changed by argument and stern warnings. For we defend ourselves precisely when we feel in danger. Increasing the level of threat isn’t going to hasten the solution. We learn to be more reasonable, more accepting of responsibility and more accurate about our weaknesses in times of security. The goal of analysis is to make us less ‘defended’. We put our weapons down, and have the courage to let ourselves get hurt.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pleasure Principle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE is the idea that we are fundamentally geared to seek pleasure. However, the pursuit of immediate gratification is often at odds with other important concerns, such as the well-being of others or our own longer-term flourishing. The term asks us to reflect on all the ways in which we sacrifice psychological growth for the sake of momentary satisfaction. For example, it is more gratifying – or at least less painful – to be irritable than to be hurt, or to be lazy rather than bored. So, in order to live well we sometimes have to go to war with our instincts. Being a mature adult means waging a selective campaign against the pleasure principle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1137" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bench.jpeg" alt="A couple lingers on a park bench" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Gratitude </b></p>
<p class="p1">It’s very hard to say thank you. In the psychoanalytic vocabulary, gratitude is the capacity to admit the merits of another person, and to recognise the good they have done you. This can be scary: it is hard to accept the scale of the debt we owe others (especially, sometimes, our parents). Gratitude is a skill we have to learn and practice. If we feel we deserve everything, we do not feel gratitude. That’s what small children are like; it doesn’t (hopefully) occur to them to think that others are making an effort on their behalf. But part of becoming an adult is realising that we have been the recipient of imperfect but still substantial affection from other people. We need to start to believe in the kindness of others and to acknowledge how often they have cut us slack.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Transitional Object</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott defined the term ‘transitional object’ to describe certain items, especially teddy bears and blankets, that children use between the ages of three and nine as away of getting used to living among others. In a child’s eyes, a transitional object in some ways has a life of its own, like another person, but at the same time it is a part of oneself. The object has to be cared for, yet it exists even when one isn’t paying attention to it. It is described as ‘transitional’ because it provides one stage of a way to forming relationships with equal, independent people. Very profound things are happening around teddies (as we always suspected). Favourite books and works of art can play an analogous role in adult life, Winnicott said.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Projection</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> PROJECTION occurs when what you think is going on in another person is really coming from you. At a party you may imagine that others are wholly at ease, are not anxious at all and have no interest in you. Really, you are projecting your own worry into the minds of others. This can go a step further. You can also relocate difficult emotions on to others. An aggressive person can feel as if they are always the victim. This is because they have projected their own rage onto other people. Exploring the ways one repositions parts of oneself onto others is fascinating. The task is then to reclaim those parts – and observe others as they are, independent of you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sublimation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> SUBLIMATION is the process whereby we convert unacceptable desires into acceptable conduct. For Freud, sex is the key thing we have to sublimate. You can’t have sex with everyone you would like, unfortunately; but the erotic impulse can – if we handle it right – become flirtation, charm, persuasiveness or a brilliant sales technique. It can even become a book or a painting that others will love. The natural desire to have everyone do exactly what you want, all of the time, can through sublimation be turned into a drive to create a perfect object. Sublimation names a process that is precious to us and gives us hope. It suggests that frustration is not the end of the story. But for that to happen, our disappointment in one direction must be met by inspiration in another.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is one of the seven virtues of Christianity. It used to have a central place in Roman ethics and Judaism as well. Today, we remain deeply impressed by the idea of charity, but often from a distance, without probing the concept too deeply, with little attempt to practise it systematically. It’s something we might have recourse to when we’re moved by a documentary on the TV or have some loose change left over after the holidays.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1074" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/timetogive.jpg" alt="Retailers Hope For A Good Christmas Despite The Current Economic Gloom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its most basic, charity means: giving someone something they need but can’t get for themselves. And normally that’s understood to mean something material. We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The heroes of Christianity are exemplars of such charity. Outside the city, Saint Francis comes across a poor man. His garments are thin and ragged. Winter is coming on and coats are expensive. The saint is moved to charity.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4122" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="poorknight1700-616x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about recognising that a person needs help with something that they can’t do for themselves – and that their helplessness is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is part of the human condition. We freely give because we appreciate how often we wouldn’t have made it if other people had not – at key points, in different contexts – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in relationships that charity becomes particularly necessary. Here we don’t generally require the charity of money, cloaks and free meals. What we are short of is charity of interpretation: that is, a charitable perspective on our weaknesses, eccentricities, anxieties and follies – failings that we are unable to explain or win sympathy for, that we merely act out, with immaturity and hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1076" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sweat.jpg" alt="Poor Dad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be that one person in a couple has badly messed up in their professional life. They made a significant decision at work that played out badly. They got severely criticised; there was talk of court action. For months, they were very agitated, and hard to live with. They couldn’t articulate their fears. They were sullen and irascible. Their partner might have added stern admonitions to those of the regulator, the senior management and people on Twitter… They could have concluded that their partner was inept, greedy, maybe a bit unprincipled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead, a charitable soul does the work the partner has not been able to do. They do the explaining for them. They understand enough about their past to have a picture of where their impatience and over-ambition came from. They hold in mind what happened with their parents and with the move to another country and with the brother who died too young. They lend a picture of who the ‘beggar’ is that is sufficiently generous and complex as to make them more than just the ‘fool’ or ‘weirdo’  they could so easily have been dismissed as.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4124" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg?resize=635%2C355" alt="Romantic Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The genuinely charitable person gives generously from a sense that they too stand in need of charity. Not right now, not over this, but in some other area. They know that self-righteousness is merely the result of a faulty memory, an inability to hold in mind – at moments when one is totally right – how often one has been deeply and definitively in the wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charity remembers how there might still be goodness amidst a lot of evil. Charity keeps in mind that if someone is tired and stressed, they are liable to behave appallingly. Charity is aware that when someone shouts an insult they are not usually revealing the secret truth about their feelings. They are trying to wound the other because they feel they have been hurt – usually by someone else, whom they don’t have the authority to injure back.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Charity is interested in mitigating circumstances; in bits of the truth that can cast a less catastrophic light on our follies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but usually they stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in life as a whole, and especially in relationships, charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided: who is weak and who is powerful changes rapidly and frequently. You are likely to be, as it were, a patron in one area and a beggar in another. So we must be kind not only because we are touched by the suffering of others but because we properly understand that we too will soon be in urgent need of an equally vital dose of charity in some other part of life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It seems like a tiny fact, just one more little blip of information that doesn’t really mean anything much, but in truth it sits on a major insight about friendship: in the paparazzi market, images of 24-year-old <em>Twilight</em> star Kristen Stewart vary greatly in price.</p>
<p class="p1">There’s a standard rate for a glamorous shot of Kristen in a Reem Acra gown on the red-carpet, arriving at the Oscars (where she was going to present the award for Achievement in Production Design).</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4167" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartA.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="The 85th Academy Awards - Arrivals - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, anyone who snaps her at the airport with a backpack, in her old clothes, going through security can charge six times as much for the resulting photos.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9728" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartC.jpg?resize=635%2C952" alt="EXCLUSIVE: Kristen Stewart takes to the friendly skies" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">A prelude to friendship</h5>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This isn’t just a matter for sub-editors. This is critical data about our society – as significant as a politician’s approval rating or the spot price for a barrel of North Sea Crude. It’s a factoid that’s worth paying attention to because it is deeply heartening. It tells us – in the decisive language of numbers – something moving and exciting about human nature.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The price is an index of our interest. We are six times more interested in Kristen in her jeans, walking through the terminal, than we are in seeing her looking formal on a red carpet. This seems weird at first because the red-carpet is meant to be the special occasion, a time when the star is at their most attractive. But in truth, we’re not that keen: we’d rather know the real person. Going through the scanner, Kristen had to remove her Doc Marten’s and the world got a glimpse of her wooly oatmeal socks. It was fascinating. We keep on thinking that what people want to see is the red carpet, big achievement formal side of us. But in reality, we crave intimacy. Not in the physical sense, but in the sense of friendship. Friendship is the oatmeal sock version of who we are.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One of the greatest British portraits of all time makes the very same move.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartD.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4170" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-310114-stewartD.jpg?resize=635%2C578" alt="PM-310114-stewartD" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Henry Raeburn’s<em> Skating Minister</em> takes a man who was mostly seen looking dignified and authoritative, standing at a pulpit and lecturing the congregation – and it makes him human. It was true 200 years ago, and it’s true today: we’d rather see the real person.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3389474442_7547f8719c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9727" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3389474442_7547f8719c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C562" alt="3389474442_7547f8719c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We prefer her like this – by a factor of 6</span></h5>
<p class="p2">It’s therefore such a pity how often our status fears go in the other direction. They keep on pushing us towards the official version of what’s supposed to be impressive – which isn’t true to how we feel. In our hearts, we want others to take their shoes off and show us their souls. But we keep on thinking that what we need to do – if we want to be liked and make friends – is get smartened up and do our own version of the grand entrance.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because it might sound merely sentimental to say all this, the brute evidence of the paparazzi price matters a lot. These are not sentimental people. The market isn’t being whimsical. It’s capturing the power of genuine demand.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know individually how much we like the true selves of others. But collectively we don’t feel confident, because we don’t trust that everyone else feels the same way as we do. The price of the images points us to a firm and reassuring truth: we can afford to approach our more intimate and more casual selves with greater confidence.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In general, we are very much alive to the benefits of exercise. And not only around physical fitness. In learning to speak another language, drive a car or play an instrument, we recognise the value of going over things again and again, of rehearsing, memorising and testing according to established principles. We willingly follow the advice of the tennis coach to take the ball a fraction earlier on the backhand or to overcome a tendency to maintain too upright a posture going into the shot. Ultimately what we are trying to do is to form good habits so that, with sufficient practice, we won’t have to think (for example) about how to reverse the car into a parking bay or return the ball from the left hand corner. It will simply be easy and natural.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2381" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-19767216-1.jpg" alt="Spain Madrid Open Tennis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1">He didn’t mind exercising to get to this moment</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, for major cultural reasons, we are extremely selective in our enthusiasm for areas where we accept the utility of practice, teaching, systematic education, rehearsal and repetition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Very strangely and sadly, exercise has come to feel alien in the area of our intimate emotional and cultural lives. Jane Austen – for instance – would have readily accepted that people have to learn how to have conversations, that there are rules to be practiced in relationships, and that compassion is something that can be learnt. She spoke movingly about what she termed ‘the training of the heart’. But we have subsequently developed a highly negative take on the role of teaching, rules and exercises in emotional, social and cultural life. It has come to seem as if rules will always be oppressive. The idea of learning how to have a relationship, be a friend or have a conversation now sounds unbearably stiff, too formal, pompous or just fake. So, today we train the cook, but leave the lover alone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2383" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/461278363.jpg" alt="ABC's &quot;The Taste&quot; - Season Two" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5>Here, we accept there are rules…</h5>
<p class="p1">People like to say that there are, at heart, no rules about conversation, bringing up a family or identifying a purpose to one’s life. There’s now a widespread dislike of generalisations and an assumption that no one knows the secrets of living well; we must simply make up the rules as best we can, there is no accumulated wisdom we can draw from. It’s about starting from scratch every time and cobbling together the answers through painful experiences, one mistake after another. Many influential 20th-century intellectual figures (Virginia Woolf, DH Lawrence, Sartre to start the list) were supporters of such spontaneity, naturalness and authenticity – and equal opponents of anything that looked like an ‘answer’ derived from Other People.</p>
<h5><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2384" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/82947255.jpg" alt="Napola Boys" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5>At one point, rules really did look like the problem</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Their praise of spontaneity was, at a certain point, very liberating and necessary. It was a plausible reaction to rigid, unimaginative and conformist societies – who in many areas followed extremely deficient rules. But our assumptions about training and exercise have stuck around even as the external environment has changed. Gradually, in part thanks to their influence, our society now is anything but oppressive or dogmatic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are now more likely to suffer from a very different set of troubles. We feel chaotic – overwhelmed by our own appetites, very unsure about what we should do with our lives, fearful of wasting opportunities and afraid we won’t accomplish anything, paralysed at times by unstructured freedom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is therefore a highly relevant moment to reconnect with the Ancient Greek idea that living well is crucially dependent upon education: upon learning emotional skills and good habits. This particular era of history seems ready for the founding insight of Greek philosophy: that the good life is something that can be taught.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4019" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour2.jpg?resize=635%2C625" alt="662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Across large swathes of existence (relationships, travel, family life, work, ambition, anxiety, attitudes to money …) there are things we can learn how to do more reliably. There are training exercises which can significantly improve how well parts of our lives will go.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This training falls into two big kinds: <strong>Exercises of Clarification</strong> and<strong> Exercises of Reinforcement</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Exercises of Clarification</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of our troubling experiences, as well as many hopeful ones, are cloudy and vague – even if they are strongly felt. Who do I envy? What career really excites me? What am I annoyed or anxious about? These are questions we don’t automatically know the answer to and can often get confused about (we shout at the wrong person, take the wrong job, miss opportunities…). Our instincts in these areas are hugely consequential for our lives – and the lives of those closest to us – and yet instinct will not be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An exercise in clarification is the deliberate practice of asking yourself searching questions about instincts and of getting into the habit of trying to answer them properly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, one may frequently feel upset or frustrated in a relationship – yet also hopeful that things can go better. It might help to have these systematic questions to hand:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do I most resent about my partner? Have I tried to explain this properly to them (rather than complaining bitterly or remaining silent)?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How would you like to be a better person in this relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What would you like to apologise about to your partner?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The emphasis is on clarification: bringing into focus half-formed thoughts, more closely defining suspicions, hopes and anxieties. In most cases, you know the answers already, sort of. But the answers are out of focus – and this is the fatal problem that proper mental exercise is designed to help us overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Exercises of Reinforcement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s a second species of exercise. Often enough our troubles cannot really be blamed on ignorance. We know what we should do. Only we don’t do it. Classically, this is the problem known by the Ancient Greeks as ‘akrasia’ – or ‘weakness of will’. We go wrong not so much because we don’t know, but because we lack the motivation to act on our best insights. So we need constant help in bolstering and reinforcing the wiser moments.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are numerous tactics for providing this assistance. For a start, it helps to hear another person say what we already kind of know; it gives the belief extra weight. It enhances our trust and makes us feel a little less alone. We aren’t looking for revelation, we’re looking for corroboration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also, hearing truths put in elegant language or images is beneficial. Wisdom sticks better in the mind when conveyed with the sensuous force of art – in a picture, a song or a poem. For example, Buddhist thought stresses our need to build up resilience to difficult events. But it does so not only through lectures or intellectual arguments, in some of its denominations, it asks us to meditate on beautiful images of bamboo trees (some of the thinnest, strongest plants on the planet), to strengthen our sense of how we should be ready to meet with the tempests of our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2387" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/c01s01a01i01.jpg" alt="c01s01a01i01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We also need big truths to be repeated to us. Once won’t be enough. Religions understood this. We might not agree with the messages they were trying to transmit. But they usefully pictured the mind like a bucket with holes in it. It can carry water, but only a short distance. Soon it has all leaked away. The insight that fired you up at 7.00pm – when you were driving home and the last rays of sunlight were falling across the trees of a suburban park and you felt a deep gratitude for existence and a longing to be more patient with your partner – will have vanished by 11.00pm. We need to keep going back and recovering the good ideas that are lost at every hour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2388" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107490482.jpg" alt="Life On Kandahar Air Base" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1">Now we need one for the mind</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We accept the need to exercise our bodies so as to get fit, but currently we are suspicious of any attempt to exercise the mind – in order to attempt to be wise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first thing we do in a gym is make diagnoses: we go to a different area to work on a different part of ourselves. This would be similar to what should happen in an ideal Philosophers’ Gym of the future. Instead of thinking that we need to work on our biceps, we might decide we need to work on our envy or on our confidence, our frustration or our capacities for gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Around current gyms, we understand the role of routine: we need to do the same thing many times to get results. We have developed some rather odd-looking but specially evolved exercise machines: various barbells, a contraption so you can flex your lower back muscles, routines with the exercise ball and so on… In the realm of the psyche there may be similar sets of odd-looking exercises, which we haven’t yet quite invented. There may be works of art you have to look at in certain ways, questions you have to ask yourself, texts to memorise, or situations to rehearse (being patient at the moment when you are irked; noting when you get defensive…).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2389" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486269289.jpg" alt="Inside the Gatorade Sports Science Institute at IMG Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an ideal Philosophers’ Gym, we might walk into a room of people being tested in mock frustrating conversations, or rehearsing moments to step down during domestic rows. In a side room, we might find people analysing recent instances of particularly stubborn anxieties or breaking down hopeful fantasies into realistic plans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It seems a folly to abandon our inner lives to individual initiative alone. All education is based on the idea of saving people time by transmitting the best that people who came before them have said and thought. We readily accept the need to train in physics, molecular biology, cooking and advanced aeronautics: we don’t insist on stumbling our way to plausible answers on how to land a plane or operate on the frontal cortex. We should therefore cease the folly of not offering people systematic help with the no less important challenges of Relationships, Careers, Children, Friends, Meaning, Loving and Dying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">The Philosophers’ Gym</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We suggest three initial exercises to start:</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There is no more ridiculed genre than the self-help book. Admit that you regularly turn to such titles to help you cope with existence and you are liable to attract the scorn and suspicion of all who aspire to look well-educated and serious. As if on a mission to deny the category even a shred of respectability, the publishers of self-help books deck them out with lurid covers while booksellers entomb them near the ‘Mind, Body, Spirit’ section, where they blur into an indistinguishable mass of sickly pink and purple spines.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t always like this. For two thousand years in the history of the west, the self-help book stood as a pinnacle of literary achievement. The Ancients were particularly adept practitioners. Epicurus wrote some three hundred self-help books on almost every topic, including <em>On Love, On Justice</em> and <em>On Human Life</em>. The Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote volumes advising his fellow Romans how to cope with anger (the still very readable <em>On Anger</em>), how to deal with the death of a child (Consolation to Marcia) and how to overcome political and financial disgrace (<em>Letter to Lucilius</em>). It is no injustice to describe Marcus Aurelius’s <em>Meditations</em> as one of the finest works of self-help ever written, as relevant to someone facing a financial meltdown as the disintegration of an empire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staug.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4099" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staug.jpg?resize=635%2C457" alt="Portrait of St Augustine of Hippo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity continued in this vein. The Benedictines and Jesuits poured out handbooks to help one navigate the perils of earthly life. In his medieval bestseller, <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, the theologian Thomas à Kempis recommended that one note down sentences from the text, learn them by heart and repeat them at moments of crisis. Great self-help writers were still dispensing advice down to the early nineteenth century. Consider that master of pithy and useful phrases, Arthur Schopenhauer, author of <em>On the Wisdom of Life</em>, who explained in 1823, ‘A man must swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more disgusting in the day ahead’. The assumption behind this long tradition was that the words of others can benefit us not only by giving us practical advice, but also – and more subtly – by recasting our private confusions and griefs into eloquent communal sentences. We feel at once less alone and less afraid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adviceinlove.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4101" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adviceinlove.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what explains the gradual decline in the prestige of self-help books that continues to this day? A key catalyst was the development of the modern university system that in the mid-19th century became the main employer for philosophers and intellectuals and started to reward them not for being useful or consoling, but for getting facts right. There began an obsession with accuracy and a corresponding neglect of utility. The idea of turning to a philosopher or historian in order to become wise (an entirely natural assumption for our ancestors) started to seem laughably idealistic and adolescent. Alongside this came a growing secularisation of society, which emphasised that the modern human being could do the business of living and dying by relying on sheer common sense, a good accountant, a sympathetic doctor and hearty doses of faith in science. The citizens of the future weren’t supposed to need lectures on how to stay calm or free of anxiety. Go to a university today in the hope of finding answers to life’s great dilemmas and the academics will laugh – or call for an ambulance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2251" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp2.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ROBBINS LIFE SELF IMPROVEMENT SEMINAR IN SAN FRANCISCO, AMERICA - 1993" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so the self-help field was abandoned to the many curious and often unfortunate types who thrive in it today: people who are reclothing the Christian message so as to promise us financial heaven if we believe in ourselves, have faith, work hard and don’t despair. Or else those with a passing acquaintance with Buddhism, psychoanalysis or Daoism. What unites modern practitioners is their fierce optimism. They make the grave assumption that the best way to cheer someone up is to tell them that all will be well. They are utterly cut off from the spirit of their more noble predecessors, who knew that the fastest way to make someone feel well is to tell her that things are as bad as, and possibly much worse than, she could ever have thought. Or, as Seneca put it so well, ‘What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4103" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp3.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need self-help books like never before, so it seems especially sad that our most serious writers are unalive to the possibilities of the genre and that the very idea of saying something is ‘useful’ to a reader has become synonymous with banality. ‘Twenty tips from Othello on relationships’ might seem like a silly idea for a book, but that has more to do with the sort of contents generally filed under such a heading than anything intrinsic to the idea. Imagine what this could have been if Carlyle, Emerson or Virginia Woolf had had a shot? In our current moral and practical confusions, the self-help book is crying out to be reborn and rehabilitated.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s one of the grandest and oddest words out there, so lofty, it doesn’t sound like something one could ever consciously strive to be – unlike say, being cultured, or kind. Others could perhaps compliment you on being it, but it wouldn’t be something you could yourself ever announce you had become.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, though it’s impossible ever to reach a stable state of wisdom, as an aspiration, wisdom deserves to be rehabilitated and take its place among a host of other, more typical goals one might harbour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2288" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinese-1.jpg" alt="CHINA-ECONOMY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s woven from many strands:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">REALISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are, first and foremost, ‘realistic’ about how challenging many things can be. They aren’t devoid of hope (that would be a folly of its own), but they are conscious of the complexities entailed in any project: for example, raising a child, starting a business, spending an agreeable weekend with the family, changing the nation, falling in love… Knowing that something difficult is being attempted doesn’t rob the wise of ambitions, but it makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic about the problems that will invariably come their way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">GRATITUDE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Properly aware that much can and does go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty, even extremely modest ones, of the kind that those with grander plans rush past. With the dangers and tragedies of existence firmly in mind, they can take pleasure in a single, uneventful, sunny day, or some pretty flowers growing by a brick wall, the charm of a three-year-old playing in a garden or an evening of banter among a few friends. It isn’t that they are sentimental and naive, precisely the opposite: because they have seen how hard things can get, they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and the sweet – whenever and wherever these arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pram.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4128" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pram.jpg?resize=635%2C399" alt="Giuseppe Ungaretti on a bench in a park smiles at a child in the cradle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FOLLY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are deeply sunk in folly: they have irrational desires and incompatible aims, they are unaware of a lot, they are prone to mood swings, they are visited by all kinds of fantasies and delusions – and are always buffeted by the curious demands of their sexuality. The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing co-existence of deep immaturity and perversity alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes. Aware that at least half of life is irrational, they try – wherever possible – to budget for madness and are slow to panic when it (reliably) rears its head.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriously. They hedge their pronouncements, they are sceptical in their conclusions. Their certainties are not as brittle as those of others. They laugh from the constant collisions between the noble way they’d like things to be, and the demented way they in fact often turn out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2290" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/folly.jpg" alt="Scientist Identifies Happiest Day of Year" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">POLITENESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are realistic about social relations, in particular, about how difficult it is to change people’s minds and have an effect on their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are therefore extremely reticent about telling people too frankly what they think. They have a sense of how seldom it is useful to get censorious with others. They want – above all – that things be nice between people, even if this means they are not totally authentic. So they will sit with someone of an opposite political persuasion and not try to convert them; they will hold their tongue at someone who seems to be announcing a wrong-headed plan for reforming the country, educating their child or directing their personal life. They’ll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others and will search more for what people have in common than what separates them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2291" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/turkey.jpg" alt="Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt (R)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SELF-ACCEPTANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise have made their peace with the yawning gap between how they would ideally want to be and what they are actually like. They have come to terms with their idiocies, flaws, ugliness, limitations and drawbacks. They are not ashamed of themselves – and therefore, don’t have to lie or dissemble in front of others. Without self-love or vanity, they can give those close to them a fairly accurate map of their neuroses and faults and of the reasons why they will be hard to live around (and therefore often aren’t such difficult companions).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2292" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mirror.jpg" alt="Eyes of the poet Alfonso Gatto are reflected in a rearview mirror" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FORGIVENESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are realistic about other people too. They recognise the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests and seek their own pleasures. It can make others appear extremely ‘mean’ and purposefully evil, but this would be to over-personalise the issue. The wise know that most hurt is not intentional, it’s a by-product of the constant collision of blind competing egos in a world of scarce resources.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are therefore slow to anger and judge. They don’t leap to the worst conclusions about what is going on in the minds of others. They will be readier to forgive from a proper sense of how difficult every life is: harbouring as it does so many frustrated ambitions, disappointments and longings. The wise appreciate the pressures people are under. Of course they shouted, of course they were rude, naturally they want to overtake on the inside lane… The wise are generous to the reasons for which people might not be nice. They feel less persecuted by the aggression and meanness of others, because they have a sense of where it comes from: a place of hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2293" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys.jpg" alt="Perry Street Prep Pride Rugby" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">RESILIENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know just how much can go wrong and things will still be – just about – liveable. The unwise person draws the boundaries of their contentment far too far out: so that it encompasses, and depends upon, fame, money, personal relationships, popularity, health… The wise person sees the advantages of all of these, but also knows that they may – before too long, at a time of fate’s choosing – have to draw the borders right back and find contentment within a more bounded space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ENVY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise person doesn’t envy idly: they realise that there are some good reasons why they don’t have many of the things they really want. They look at the tycoon or the star and have a decent grasp of why they didn’t ever make it to that level. It looks like just an accident, an unfair one, but there were in fact some logical grounds: they didn’t work as hard, they don’t have anything like the drive or mental capacity…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2300" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3135259.jpg" alt="Little Winners" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, the wise see that some destinies are truly shaped by nothing more than accident. Some people are promoted randomly. Companies that aren’t especially deserving can suddenly make it big. Some people have the right parents. The winners aren’t all noble and good. The wise appreciate the role of luck and don’t curse themselves overly at those junctures where they have evidently not had as much of it as they would have liked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise emerge as realistic about the consequences of winning and succeeding. They may want to win as much as the next person, but they are aware of how many fundamentals will remain unchanged, whatever the outcome. They don’t exaggerate the transformations available to us. They know how much we remain tethered to some basic dynamics in our personalities, whatever job we have or material possession we acquire. This is both cautionary (for those who succeed) and hopeful (for those who won’t). The wise see the continuities across those two categories over-emphasised by modern consumer capitalism: ‘success’ and ‘failure’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">REGRETS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our ambitious age, it is common to begin with dreams of being able to pull off an unblemished life, where one can hope to get the major decisions – in love and work – right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the wise realise that it is impossible to fashion a spotless life; one will make some extremely large and utterly uncorrectable errors in a number of areas. Perfectionism is a wicked illusion. Regret is unavoidable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But regret lessens the more we see that error is endemic across the species. One can’t look at anyone’s life story without seeing some devastating mistakes etched across it. These errors are not coincidental but structural; they arise because we all lack the information we need to make choices in time-sensitive situations. We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2295" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bench.jpg" alt="Couple Sitting on a Bench" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CALM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise know that turmoil is always around the corner – and they have come to fear and sense its approach. That’s why they nurture such a strong commitment to calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement. A day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. They are not afraid of having a somewhat boring time. There could, and will again, be so much worse…</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Today, like most days, you are anxious. It is there in the background, always present, sometimes more to the fore, sometimes less so, but never truly banished – at least not for longer than an evening. The anxiety appears to be about some very particular things: the party where you won’t know many people, the complicated trip you have to take to some unfamiliar hotels, the direction of your career, the drilling outside, the email problem, the claustrophobic interior of the plane, your digestive system…</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But considered from a broader perspective, the problem for us is larger, more damning and a great deal more fundamental. Beyond any specific thing we happen to be worrying about, looked at over time, a greater conclusion is inescapable: we simply are anxious, to our core, in the very basic make-up of our being. Though we may focus day-to-day on this or that particular worry creating static in our minds, what we are really up against is anxiety as a permanent feature of life, something irrevocable, existential, dogged – and responsible for ruining a dominant share of our brief time on earth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tortured by anxiety, we naturally fall prey to powerful fantasies about what might – finally – bring us calm. At certain points, especially in the north, the fantasies latch on to travel.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here, at last, there would be peace: under the clear blue sky, on the island eleven-and-a-half hours from here, seven time zones away, with the warm water lapping at our feet, and with access to a seaside villa on pontoons, with Egyptian cotton sheets and a refreshing breeze. It is just a matter of holding on for a few more months – and parting with an extraordinary sum.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2304" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kitchen11.jpg" alt="kitchen1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or perhaps we would be calm if the house could be as we really want it: with everything in its place, no more clutter, pristine walls, ample cupboards, stripped oak, limestone, recessed lighting and a bank of new appliances.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Or perhaps we will be calm when one day we reach the right place in the company, or the novel is sold, or the film is made or our shares are worth $5bn – and we can walk into a room of strangers and they will know at once.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2305" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/144728761.jpg" alt="Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Rings Nasdaq Opening Bell" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or (and this one we keep a little more to ourselves), there might be calm if we had the right sort of person in our lives, someone who could properly understand us, a creature with whom it wouldn’t be so difficult, who would be kind and playfully sympathetic, who would have thoughtful, compassionate eyes and in whose arms we could lie in peace, almost like a child – though not quite.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4163" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500.jpg?resize=635%2C580" alt="tumblr_myue1hLfym1t5nem3o1_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Travel, Beauty, Status and Love: the four great contemporary ideals around which our fantasies of calm collect and which taken together are responsible for the lion’s share of the frenzied activities of the modern economy: its airports, long-haul jets and resort hotels; its overheated property markets, furniture companies and unscrupulous building contractors; its networking events, status-driven media and competitive business deals; its bewitching actors, soaring love songs and busy divorce lawyers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet despite the promises and the passion expended in the pursuit of these goals, none of them will work. There will be anxiety at the beach, in the pristine home, after the sale of the company, and in the arms of anyone we will ever seduce, however often we try.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Anxiety is our fundamental state for well-founded reasons:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we are intensely vulnerable physical beings, a complicated network of fragile organs all biding their time before eventually letting us down catastrophically at a moment of their own choosing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we have insufficient information upon which to make most major life decisions: we are steering more or less blind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we can imagine so much more than we have and live in mobile-driven, mediatised societies where envy and restlessness will be a constant.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we are the descendants of the great worriers of the species, the others having been trampled and torn apart by wild animals, and because we still carry in our bones – into the calm of the suburbs – the terrors of the savannah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because visible objects and locations, oak tables and beaches, can only symbolise calm to our eyes rather than instil it in our psyches.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because the progress of our careers and of our finances play themselves out within the tough-minded, competitive, destructive, random workings of an uncontained capitalist engine.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- Because we rely for our self-esteem and sense of comfort on the love of people we cannot control and whose needs and hopes will never align seamlessly with our own.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of which is not to say that there aren’t better and worse ways to approach our condition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The single most important move is acceptance. There is no need – on top of everything else – to be anxious that we are anxious. The mood is no sign that our lives have gone wrong, merely that we are alive. We should be more careful when pursuing things we imagine will spare us anxiety. We can pursue them by all means, but for other reasons than fantasies of calm – and with a little less vigour and a little more scepticism.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should spare ourselves the burden of loneliness. We are far from the only ones with this problem. Everyone is more anxious than they are inclined to tell us. Even the tycoon and the couple in love are suffering. We’ve collectively failed to admit to ourselves what we are truly like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We must learn to laugh about our anxieties – laughter being the exuberant expression of relief when a hitherto private agony is given a well-crafted social formulation in a joke. We can laugh about the terrors of having a body:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2307" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase64fbdf5d47a1f62f43.png" alt="pngbase64fbdf5d47a1f62f43" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And about the absurd scale of our ambitions:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2308" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6437d174dce1ed1da7.png" alt="pngbase6437d174dce1ed1da7" data-recalc-dims="1" />And about how easily we lose perspective on everything:</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2309" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/anti-cap-245-sailboat-wreck-tea-cup.jpg" alt="anti-cap-245-sailboat-wreck-tea-cup" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should hug; not the forced intimacy or oppressive bonhomie of most modern hugs, but the melancholy sympathetic way Botticelli’s angels do it, having come down to earth to offer comfort to humans for the brute facts of earthly existence:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4165" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5.png?resize=635%2C528" alt="pngbase6478a976fc777ee3d5" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We must suffer alone. But we can at least hold out our arms to our similarly tortured, fractured, and above all else, anxious neighbours, as if to say, in the kindest way possible: ‘I know…’</span></p>
