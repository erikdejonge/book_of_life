				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re sometimes not too sure how we get into good friendships. It seems to happen rather mysteriously: we talk of somewhat randomly “clicking” with people. Trying to plan for it sounds like cheating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is something at the heart of many friendships that seems important to identify and &#8211; in a way &#8211; to get good at: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">vulnerability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8914" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z.jpg?resize=635%2C510" alt="205857798_ebc9a8a5ea_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s too easy to assume that what makes us likeable are our strengths, our accomplishments, the things we’re proud of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly this </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">impresses</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it isn’t what draws others to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We get close to someone the more they &#8211; and we &#8211; find ourselves able gracefully to depart from the official story of what human beings are like, and can start to show the awkward truths which underlie the cheerful facade. These are the truths with which we have been lonely for too long: how unlike ‘normal’ sexuality our sex lives actually are; how full of envy our careers are proving; how unsatisfactory our family can be; how worried we are all the time.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/487117524_a761fb1df6_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8912" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/487117524_a761fb1df6_o.jpg?resize=635%2C641" alt="487117524_a761fb1df6_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revealing any of these things places us in great danger. Others could laugh; social media would have a field day. That’s the point. We can only get close by revealing things that would, in the wrong hands, be capable of inflicting appalling humiliation on us. Friendship is the dividend of gratitude that flows from an acknowledgement that one has offered something very valuable to someone: not a fancy present, but something even more precious, the key to one’s self-esteem and dignity.</span></p>
<p>It’s deeply poignant that we should expend so much effort on trying to look strong before the world &#8211; when, all the while, it’s really only ever the revelation of the somewhat embarrassing, sad, melancholy and anxious bits of us that are what makes us endearing to others, and can transform strangers into friends.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our brains are brilliant instruments, able to reason, synthesise, remember and imagine at an extraordinary pitch and rate. We trust them immediately and innately &#8211; and have reasons to be deeply proud of them too.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, these brains &#8211; let’s call them walnuts in honour of their appearance &#8211; are also very subtly and dangerously flawed machines, flawed in ways that typically don’t announce themselves to us and therefore give us few clues as to how on guard we should be about our mental processes. Most of the walnut’s flaws can be attributed to the way the instrument evolved over millions of years. It emerged to deal with threats, some of which are no longer with us, and at the same time, it had no chance to develop adequate responses to a myriad of challenges generated by our own complex societies. We should feel pity for its situation and compassion for ourselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7785" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b.jpg?resize=635%2C644" alt="4734545741_d8ce3fb338_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Attempting to live requires us to adopt a focused and ongoing scepticism towards a great many of the ideas, schemes, plans and feelings generated by the faulty walnut that stands at the top of our spinal column.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are just some of the many things we need to watch out for:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut is influenced by the body to an extent it doesn’t recognise:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut is extremely bad at understanding why it is having certain thoughts and ideas. It tends always to attribute them to rational, objective conditions out in the world, rather than seeing that they might be stemming from the impact of the body upon its thought processes. It doesn’t typically notice the role that levels of sleep, sugar, hormones and other physiological factors play upon the formation of ideas. The walnut adheres to a psychological intepretation of plans and positions that are, at base, frequently merely physiological. Therefore, it can feel certain that the right answer is to divorce or leave the job rather than go back to bed or eat something to raise blood sugar levels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/888373079_404a5b6556_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7786" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/888373079_404a5b6556_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="888373079_404a5b6556_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut is influenced by its past, but can’t see its own projections:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut believes it is judging each new situation on its own merits, but it is inevitably drawing upon patterns of action and feeling shaped in previous years. This saves time, and has real evolutionary advantages, except that many situations in the present are in fact deceptive, resembling the past only enough to trigger a familiar response, while in fact having many unique characteristics that get overlooked. At moments of ambiguity, the walnut can jump to some catastrophic conclusions. It might, for example, assume that any older man who speaks in a confident way is out to humiliate them, when actually it was just one man, their father, who did this &#8211; or it will find it hard to get close to all women because one specific woman happened to be a source of trauma between the ages of 1 and 10. It’s deeply understandable, but very regrettable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The Walnut doesn’t like to stop and think:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut evolved for rapid, instinctive decision-making &#8211; and has a grievously hard time stepping back to address what we might term the big first order questions. It will always be keener to do than reflect, to act rather than analyse. Remember that philosophy is, at best 2,000 years old. We prefer to keep running a business the way it’s always been run rather than stop and ask: what would it mean to properly help our customers? We rush to book a holiday rather than pause and reflect on what we really enjoyed about past trips. We form an ambition to break into journalism because we enjoy being ‘creative’ rather than analysing the component parts of our interests. We hence miss our own vagueness, inconsistency and confusion. So bad is the walnut at thinking, it often needs another walnut nearby to help it along its way. Thinking generates anxiety and a desire to run fast in the opposite direction because of the difficult truths the walnut might unearth. But in the presence of another walnut, we can’t so easily bolt and turn back to the web. That’s why philosophy started as a conversation and psychoanalysis depends on two people unpacking one person’s thoughts and associations. Sadly, we rarely call on other walnuts to help us analyse, and usually pass the time with walnuts chatting idly about sport or the latest celebrity scandal. In short, the walnut is very good at seeing what others are up to, but finds it hugely hard to gain insights into itself. It can take it thirty years to gradually gain an insight that was obvious to a stranger within 2 minutes. The walnut seems to be a machine that’s not designed to look at itself (like our eyes can’t see the middle of our backs).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7787" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="50892860_3b4cf0f7f0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is bad at self-control and gets passionate about, and scared of the wrong things:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut constantly gets excited about things which aren’t good for it: sugar, salt and sex with strangers for a start. Advertising knows how to exploit this cognitive frailty to perfection. Our confusions can generally be traced back to targets that would once have been crucial and fitting for us to focus on. Our desires used to be reliable in simpler environments, but in the complicated conditions of modernity, they cause chaos. The same holds true for our fears: in the past, fears were simply bound to things that could kill us. Fears were a good idea to get us out of genuine dangers. But nowadays, many things excite our fear systems without there being any real threat. We have panic attacks before speaking in public for no good reason &#8211; while at the same time, the real, more subtle threats of modernity (global warming or another subprime mortgage financial crisis) evade our detection radars entirely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is egocentric, not polycentric:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut is primed to look at things from its own point of view. It often simply can’t believe that there are other ways of considering an issue. Other people can therefore seem perverse, or horrible to it &#8211; sparking outrage or self-pity. It’s only in the last second, from an evolutionary point of view, that the walnut has started to try to imagine what it might be like to be someone else (a symptom of this is that it’s learnt to take pleasure in novels). But this is still a fragile empathetic capacity, which tends to collapse, especially when the walnut is tired, and someone is trying to persuade it of a strange-sounding idea.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3786721866_332a789303_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7788" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3786721866_332a789303_z.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="3786721866_332a789303_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut is intellectually squeamish:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut doesn’t like uncomfortable information. It doesn’t want to hear about problems. It looks out for information that confirms its biases and choices. It hates being the devil’s advocate. It favours short-term comfort over long-term growth and evolution. If confronted with a disquieting fact, it will tend to repress or skirt it. The walnut places self-protection way above truth. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut isn’t an independent thinker:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut grew up dependent for its survival on the mood of the group or clan. It is therefore highly primed to fit in with common sense and prevailing opinion. It doesn’t generally like to use itself as a source of original data or insight. Other people’s opinions matter hugely irrespective of how foolish they might be &#8211; or indeed widespread. Because we came from small groups, one or two compliments can delight us; one criticism can sow panic. This is tricky in the age of Twitter. We get hypersensitive to what an absurdly small number of others believe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7789" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z.jpg?resize=635%2C470" alt="7040908861_f56d66f8b5_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">- The walnut misunderstands causality:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The walnut used to think it might have been responsible for the lightning in the sky and that earthquakes were a result of its own bad thoughts and deeds. It took a while for that skewed perspective to be overcome. But the walnut still projects personal dynamics and overproduces generalities based on things that have happened to it: it stays trapped by personal rather than statistical or objective experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CONCLUSION:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Being more vigilant about the flaws in our walnuts gives us a range of important advantages: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- we get better at noticing the potential of flaws in our own judgement &#8211; and therefore stand a higher chance of not making them. We can only start to avoid mistakes when we know mistakes are an active possibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- when we deal with other people, we can ask ourselves whether they might be acting from a walnut flaw, but not know it. This will make us both bolder about disagreeing with them and also kinder and more generous in the face of their less than sensible behaviours.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7791" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3556646524_a96d9fbf5b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- when we deal with large groups of people, we can be aware that the walnut does very weird things in packs &#8211; but that’s OK and no reason to panic if we find our ideas are meeting with resistance. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At heart, compensating for the faulty equipment that nature has given us is the task of what we call: education, culture and civilisation. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The flaws in the walnut are also what makes it imperative that we try to act with kindness and tolerance: we should at all times go easy on ourselves and others, for we’re trying to do some very difficult things around one another, with the use of a highly troublesome and only intermittently accurate tool.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Our societies are very interested in winners but don’t really know what to do about losers – of which there are always, by definition, far more.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a long time, around success and failure, the rhetoric tends to be very upbeat. We hear about resilience, bouncing back, never surrendering and giving it another go. But there’s only so long this kind of talk can go on. At some point, the conclusion becomes inevitable: things won’t work out. The political career isn’t going to have a come-back. There’ll be no way of getting finance for the film. The novel won’t be accepted by the thirty-second publisher. The criminal charges are forever going to taint one’s reputation. One’s stuffed up big time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Samuel_Beckett_Pic_1-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6025" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Samuel_Beckett_Pic_1-1.jpg?resize=635%2C556" alt="Samuel_Beckett,_Pic,_1 (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Where does responsibility for success and failure lie? Nowadays, squarely with the individual concerned. That’s why failure isn’t just hard (as it has always been), it is a catastrophe. There is no metaphysical consolation, no possibility of appealing to an idea of ‘bad luck,’ no one to blame but oneself. No wonder suicide rates climb exponentially once societies become modern and start to hold people profoundly responsible for their biographies. Meritocracies turn failure from a misfortune to an unbudgeable existential verdict on the state of one’s soul. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But not all societies and eras have seen success and failure in such a stark light. In Ancient Greece, another rather remarkable possibility – quite ignored by our own era – was envisaged: you could be good and yet fail. To keep this idea at the front of the collective imagination, the Ancient Greeks developed a particular art form: tragic drama. They put on huge festivals, at which all the citizens were expected to attend, to act out stories of appalling, often grisly, failure: people were seen to break a minor law, or make a hasty decision or sleep with the wrong person and the result was ignominy and death. Yet what happened was shown to be to a large extent in the hands of what the Greeks called ‘fate’ or ‘the Gods’. It was the Greeks’ poetic way of saying that things often work out in random ways, according to dynamics that simply don’t reflect the merits of the individuals concerned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/162596339.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5896" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/162596339.jpg?resize=635%2C457" alt="85th Annual Academy Awards - Show" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In <em>The Poetics</em>, the philosopher Aristotle defined the key ingredients of tragedy. The hero of the tragedy should be a decent person: ‘better than average’, often high-born but prone to making small mistakes, as we all do. At the start, it may not be obvious that it is an error they are making. But by an unfortunate chain of events, for which they are not wholly to blame, this small mistake leads to a catastrophe.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tragedy is the sympathetic, morally-complex account of how good people can end up in disastrous situations. It is the very opposite of today’s tabloid newspaper or social mediasphere, where the mob rushes to make judgements on those who have slipped up. Aristotle thought it extremely important that people see tragic works on a regular basis to counter their otherwise strong inclinations to judge and moralise. A good tragedy should, thought Aristotle, inspire both pity and fear: pity for the tragic hero based on an understanding of how easy it is to make the slip that leads to disaster; and fear for oneself as one realises how open our lives are to careering out of control. All of us could quite quickly come apart if ever events chose to test us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3304460.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5897" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/3304460.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="Captive Greeks" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tragedy is meant to be a corrective to easy judgement, it exists to counter our natural instincts to admire only the successful, to spurn all those who fail,  and to dismiss unfortunates as losers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re currently very uncomfortable around the idea of a good person not succeeding. We’d rather say that they weren’t good at all than embrace a far more disturbing and less well-publicised thought: that – in fact – the world is very unfair. But without the idea of tragedy, we make existence for everyone far crueller and far more judgemental than it really need be. It’s time to look back in time to recover an extremely important idea.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hindu sages, Christian monks and Buddhist ascetics all speak of reaching moments of &#8216;higher consciousness&#8217; – through meditation or chanting, fasting or pilgrimages.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_481693761.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5807" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_481693761.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Yogi man meditating on the Ghats" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, the way in which these spiritual people discuss their states of higher consciousness has a tendency to put a lot of secular types on edge. It can all sound maddeningly vague, wishy washy, touchy-feely – and, for want of a better word, annoying. What on earth do these gurus really mean?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We deeply sympathise with such frustrations, not being by nature particularly attracted to the ineffable or the mysterious. However, it seems that the idea of higher consciousness is in fact a very interesting one, which has nothing inherently to do with spirituality and can be defined simply enough in strictly rational and secular terms.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is how we see it: as human beings, we spend most of our lives functioning in states of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>lower consciousness, where what we are principally concerned with is ourselves, our survival and our own success, narrowly defined.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_158697230.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5808" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_158697230.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Consumers In The Christmas Eve Retail Rush" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ordinary life rewards practical, unintrospective, self-justifying outlooks that are the hallmarks of what we could call &#8216;lower&#8217; consciousness. Neuroscientists speak of a &#8216;lower&#8217; part of the brain they term the reptilian mind and tell us that under its sway, we strike back when we&#8217;re hit, blame others, quell any stray questions that lack immediate relevance, fail to free-associate and stick closely to a flattering image of who we are and where we are heading.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, at rare moments, when there are no threats or demands upon us, perhaps late at night or early in the morning, when our bodies and passions are comfortable and quiescent, we have the privilege of being able to access the higher mind – what neuroscientists call our neocortex, the seat of imagination, empathy and impartial judgement. We loosen our hold on our own egos and ascend to a less biased and more universal perspective, casting off a little of the customary anxious self-justification and brittle pride.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In such states, the mind moves beyond its particular self-interests and cravings. We start to think of other people in a more imaginative way. Rather than criticise and attack, we are free to imagine that their behaviour is driven by pressures derived from their own more primitive minds, which they are generally in no position to tell us about. Their temper or viciousness are, we now see, symptoms of hurt rather than of ‘evil’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154503892.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5810" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_154503892.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="City Lofts, Dock 9, Salford Quays, Manchester" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to explain others&#8217; actions by their distress, rather than simply in terms of how it affects us. We perceive that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism or aggression, but always – when we can manage it – love.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At such moments, the world reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort, full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others, but also a place of tenderness and longing, beauty and touching vulnerability. The fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">One’s own life feels less precious; one can contemplate being no longer present with tranquility. One’s interests are put aside and one may imaginatively fuse with transient or natural things: trees, the wind, a moth, clouds or waves breaking on the shore. From this point of view, status is nothing, possessions don’t matter, grievances lose their urgency. If certain people could encounter us at this point, they might be amazed at our transformation and at our newfound generosity and empathy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_176435178.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5812" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/GettyImages_176435178.jpg?resize=635%2C404" alt="Meteor Shower Over The United Kingdom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">States of higher consciousness are, of course, desperately short lived. We shouldn’t in any case aspire to make them permanent, because they don’t sit so well with the many important practical tasks we all need to attend to. But we should make the most of them when they arise, and harvest their insights for the time when we require them most.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Higher consciousness is a huge triumph over the primitive mind which cannot envisage any such possibilities. Ideally, we would be a little more alive to the advantages of this higher mind and strive to make our oceanic experiences somewhat less random and less clothed in unnecessary mystery.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Why does being ‘a good person’ have such a bad name? In the modern world, the idea of trying to be good or kind conjures up all sorts of negative associations: of piety, solemnity, bloodlessness and sexual renunciation. It’s telling that ‘wicked’ has even become a term of praise.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And yet the project of being good is as vital, or even more important, for the individual and society as is the project of being healthy. Yet while we have no problem with going to the gym to get fitter, it sounds deeply weird, even creepy, to suggest that one might ‘work’ at being better or nicer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowning.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4126" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/crowning.jpg?resize=635%2C673" alt="Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s because we imagine that practice has nothing to do with being good – and if it is involved, then it’s merely a route to being fake. We assume you just are good (or are not) but exercise is not involved. This seems profoundly mistaken. Just as we have physical muscles, so we have ethical ones, and they too must be put through their paces. Goodness has to be worked at.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the ethical gym of the future, we might regularly be put through our paces. We would have to imagine life through another’s eyes, practice giving way in arguments, emulate the diplomacy and tact of paragons of patience and learn to deflect despair through calculated doses of hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Aristotle thought that being good meant practising twelve key virtues, Christianity argued for seven.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There’s no scientific answer, but the key seems to be to have some kind of list with which to guide our efforts at being good. We all want better lives, until now, too few of us have shown much interest in being better people.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We live in a world saturated with disagreement. People are at odds about pretty much everything from when to order a taxi, go out to dinner to whether there should there be a caliphate; from the kind of orbit the International Space Station should assume; the right way to cook lasagna to whether Hungary is in Eastern or Central Europe, and how long a child should be allowed to play Minecraft on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">While disagreement <i>can</i> be civilised, interesting and productive, it is much too frequently a powerful source of misery: we get enraged and bewildered; we are appalled at the views of others and feel intensely bothered by them; we feel defeated, hopeless and lonely; we agonise, rehearse the conflict alone in our heads, worry, feel guilty, get upset…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/464487025.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5339" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/464487025.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Morecambe and Wise." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreement is especially pressing now, because of certain large societal forces that have been building for the last couple of centuries. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">1. Politics</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The developed world is now democratic. We’ve long been moving away from habits of deference and from hierarchies in which most people don’t feel it’s their role to have much of a view about a lot of things. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When everyone can vote it matters a lot what everyone thinks. Having opinions becomes more than a luxury, indeed, it’s a necessity in a well-functioning democracy: one needs to have opinions about everything from who should rule to where the nuclear power stations should be positioned. But while we are encouraged to have opinions, little attention is paid to what we do when &#8211; as seems to be the constant case &#8211; we find that these opinions clash bitterly with those of our fellow citizens.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">2. Relationships of Equality</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To ask any couple what they disagree about is one of the more fascinating and consoling exercises: we realise we’re not alone.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">At the same time, disagreement in relationships feels more troubling than in the past, because low expectations once made contentions both routine and in line with aspirations. One was less disturbed by disagreements because the idea of a relationship of total agreement, sympathy and mutuality wasn’t on the cards &#8211; it is a very recent invention, dating back (at best) to the mid-eighteenth century.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/527771563.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5341" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/527771563.jpg?resize=635%2C367" alt="Rinald and Armida" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5">There is also the issue of hierarchy. For most of history, we lived in patriarchies: it was the men who settled disagreements within families. Now there’s a profound (but historically still quite novel) sense of equality, between couples and also with children. We trust that couples should talk through their beliefs, they should know and be interested in, and respect, each other’s minds. No one can be the boss in any particular area.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">This extends to children: children are taken to be founts of spontaneous insight and novel perspective. Their opinions deserve to be listened to as well. So concerned are we to ensure that children’s egos are not prematurely crushed, we encourage them to have opinions about all aspects of life. It can – as a result – be extremely hard to come to a decision on anything, including what to have for dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The democratic cacophony and chaos within the family mirrors that in the political world beyond.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">No longer able to govern hierarchically, we are not yet able to reach understanding and manage disagreement. This is the moment we are at.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The closer we are to someone, the more disagreement has the power to upset us. And we are upset because a deep longing in love is to find someone who wholly agrees with us about everything.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If a distant cousin doesn’t have the same taste in films, we don’t care. If our lover doesn’t think a particular scene is funny, we might start to question the foundations of our union.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We demand much higher levels of agreement in personal relationships than in other parts of our lives, because we are looking for our views to be confirmed and understood at every step.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That is because we are vulnerable here as we are in few other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">3. Technology </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has made disagreement more vivid. We are very readily brought into contact with other people’s abrasive attitudes – which, until recently – we could never have encountered. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">If you follow a BBC report on a speech given by the leader of the opposition (for instance) you are alerted to the fact that someone by the name of Cockshield considers him to be an ‘ugly socialist maggot!’ and you get exposure to the opinion of a certain Phill Watts: ‘He does not care about Britain, he cares about his career and making money, he&#8217;s in it for four or five years if he wins and after that he gets a nice big pay check and an early retirement and a luxury life that is his real goal.’ </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In the past, the capacity to express disagreement was curtailed by fear of laying oneself open to the retaliation from the person one disagreed with. If one called someone a ‘thieving, lying worthless piece of shit’, one would be expected to be condemned by the community and possibly challenged to a duel. Now, one can throw out sentences like this on social media with zero cost and in total anonymity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In addition, there’s a feeling that being verbally abused online isn’t such a problem. One mustn’t be thin-skinned, one should be able to put up with the nasty comments of others. While our societies are very alive to certain forms of racism and misogyny, they are still remarkably sanguine about the ordinary forms of abuse that are traded on social media every minute.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/455928842.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5382" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/455928842.jpg?resize=635%2C417" alt="Outside The Brooklyn, NY Court House" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> We do not, as a society, take ‘being offended’ very seriously &#8211; and therefore offence is rife.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has also generated stronger opinions; it has emboldened people whose opinions might previously have been hedged by a doubt about whether anyone else agreed, by introducing them to people who agree with them and strengthen their convictions. Someone with a passing, slightly embarrassed sense that Pluto should be recategorised as a planet can now join multiple websites full of people who think of little else. The same applies to politics, pornography, religion etc. If you are a Marxist but also a Christian Fundamentalist you can inhabit a corner of the online world in which it is taken for granted that this is the only intelligent way to see the world. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So thanks to technology, we are exposed to the uninhibited disagreements of other people – and also the emboldening reassurance of fellow tribal devotees. In short, technology polarises and inflames. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> ***</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still, rather than despair, we must accept that disagreement will be constant and ubiquitous. We might fantasise about universal harmony, about reason prevailing spontaneously and about everyone being sweetly tolerant. But vicious disagreement is not going to go away by itself. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">So we need to learn how to disagree well, how to navigate through a life in which we will inevitably conflict with many people over expectations, demands, hopes, convictions, priorities and attitudes. We need to deal well with disagreement so we can cope better in our own lives and make our own contributions (however modest) to a saner society.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><strong><span class="s2"> HELPFUL MOVES</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DON’T RUSH OVER DISAGREEMENTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreements are often aggravated by a refusal to give them the time they would need to be properly untangled, because we assume that they aren’t inherently difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We think it should be ‘easy’ to agree on certain things &#8211; who should run the country or what to do about pollution or how to arrange the bedroom. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An unwarranted notion that something is ‘common sense’ is the fuel that aggravates many disagreements.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We should take inspiration from the patient way in which Socrates, the first great philosopher, untangled the knots in thinking in the minds of his fellow Ancient Athenians. It might take an hour to go through someone’s ideas of justice or goodness or love.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5359" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg1.jpg?resize=635%2C414" alt="Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A fatal assumption of the obviousness of things particularly bedevils domestic life. Here couples are routinely to be found not only disagreeing, but also feeling that their disagreements are small and should be dealt with fast. How silly to spend an hour arguing over the temperature of the bedroom. How absurd to disagree (again) about what time it’s best to order the taxi.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We work with an unhelpful picture of seriousness. There&#8217;s a particular kind of bad mood that follows when something one expected to be easy turns out not to be. One is at once seriously angry and unable to take one&#8217;s anger seriously. Reduced to stalemate, what follows is nagging and shirking. Nagging: that repeated unsympathetic and unpsychological attempt to force the other party into acquiescence, without any attempt to understand their position (as one might try to do if one accepted that something was hard). Nagging assumes the partner could only be disagreeing out of wilfulness and therefore that prodding and poking can be the only recourse. And shirking: that sullen refusal to respond to the poking while maintaining an underhand, despairing reluctance to put forward any convincing rationale for one&#8217;s resistance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The two parties hope the problem – so boring to them both – will simply go away. Yet there are, of course in reality, no &#8216;small&#8217; issues. Philosophies of life stir and collide beneath the surface of apparently petty squabbles. Irritations are the outward indications of stifled debates about competing conceptions of existence. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If we’re going to disagree, and we will, we should at least do our disagreements the honour of spending a lot of time on them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DISAGREEMENT IS NORMAL</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To continue a little further with something that pertains particularly to relationships: it’s easy to be embarrassed about how much disagreement there is in the average relationship. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We think it’s weird, but it’s not. It’s just that our idea of the normal is skewed unfairly towards harmony. So it would be hugely helpful to see more evidence of couples disagreeing. Generally, we see other people&#8217;s relationships only from the outside: we see couples walking comfortably round the market buying apples or bantering at a drinks party. We hardly ever get to see what they are like together in their trickier moments, what goes on when they get very upset, in what ways do they make each other deeply frustrated: how they drive each other mad. How many things they disagree on, and with what passion and intensity, and also, with what tragic-comic results.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By total contrast, we know our own relationships from the inside. The difference between these perspectives makes for a damaging distortion. Our sense of what a &#8216;good enough&#8217; relationship looks like is unfairly biased. We need to help ourselves to a more accurate, more informed picture of normal relationships. Despite all the books and the films: art lets us down in terms of holding up an adequate mirror to our daily follies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Pretty high levels of conflict, meanness, folly and disappointment are standard. They are part and parcel of good enough relationships. A good relationship isn&#8217;t one in which the couple get along well most of the time. It&#8217;s one in which they&#8217;ve learned to accept that painful difficulties and frustrations are normal.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That this piece of knowledge is not yet very widespread explains the ongoing high incidence of divorce. We are not only unhappy, fatefully, we believe that our unhappiness is anomalous and a sign of error: and so we escape our perceived &#8216;unnecessary&#8217; troubles by leaving one relationship and starting another. And end up with a different set of sorrows.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>DON’T IMPORT ENERGY FROM ELSEWHERE INTO YOUR DISAGREEMENTS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Many of our disagreements are broadly about intellectual matters: the future of the euro, immigration, debt, censorship, education policy… </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You might find yourself taking a passionate stand on the economy of Peru, the importance of George Orwell, whether the Chinese reached America in the 15th Century, the status of women in 18th century France … (Everyone’s list is unique). These are not inherently unworthy topics – but the intensity that gets invested in them can be disproportionate to what is really at stake. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In cooler moments you might wonder why you get so worked up about them. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It’s here we encounter the phenomenon of <b><i>Energy Imported from Elsewhere</i></b>: in this dynamic, the fuel for a disagreement is not coming purely from the topic under debate. The intensity comes from things that are going on elsewhere in your life. At the time we don’t realise that this is what is going on – which makes it very hard to calm a disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Energy gets imported in at least <b><i>five </i></b>distinctive ways: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">One: Anger is redirected and concentrated</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You are angry about something, or someone &#8211; but for some reason that anger can’t find a good outlet. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It could be someone senior at work (to whom you can’t express your annoyance).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/105698990.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5348" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/105698990.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Wall Street Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A friend who has let you down but you don’t want them to see how hurt you are.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Multi-polar frustrations: the train was late, your shoe hurts, you feel tired – but there’s no one in particular to blame.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The anger that belongs in these other places gets imported into the disagreement. It gets discharged on a convenient (but otherwise inappropriate) person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Two: We are arguing with the past</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes we’re disagreeing with people who are dead or gone. The present disagreement is a proxy for an issue from the past. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You could never get your father to see the merits of your career choice, so you try to convince him via getting worked up with the person sitting next to you at dinner.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5362" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-250314-kerrC.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="200364690-008" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was an acquaintance at college whose political ideas irritated you; you are always trying to prove them wrong via lecturing strangers at drinks parties.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your ex-partner was always going on at you for being selfish; now you try to win the argument against them by mocking ‘bleeding hearts’ to anyone who will listen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Three: Frustrated sexual desire gets channelled into disagreement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There’s someone you are attracted to (though you might be reluctant to admit it); you find them exciting &#8211; but they don’t seem much interested in you. Disagreement offers a way of making contact; you contradict them, you make them acknowledge the importance of a certain fact; you rather forcibly try to dislodge one of their pet theories. The energy isn’t coming just from the overt topic – it’s borrowed from thwarted desire. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Four: We are trying to compensate for a feeling of humiliation</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In an unequal world, some have more than us. It might be more money, more status, better looks or more education. And we are easily made to feel lesser – even if it’s not at all what the other person intends. The pent up fear of humiliation can get re-directed towards argumentative aggression. Argument becomes an alternative to a fight we’re not allowed to have.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Five: We long for clarity in an ambiguous world</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Often we have to live with huge amounts of uncertainty and ambiguity. In most cases, we just don’t know what the right answer is.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">A major project at work might not succeed, you have to grapple with issues where there’s no obvious right or wrong – no one knows yet; should you stay in a relationship or leave – it can be agonisingly hard to weigh the pros and cons; how should you deal with a friend who is being difficult but who you like very much. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> We have a deep longing to find things that are simple and clear – and often, topics over which we disagree passionately provide the perfect opportunity. You find someone who is totally wrong (over the Euro or immigration). You feel you are completely right. The decisiveness might not really be justified – but you need to find something to be completely right about – given how much you worry about what is right in other areas.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The more you are aware of this possibility, the more you can see it happening, in your own life and in the behaviour of others. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The Repatriation of Energy is a major task of maturity. We need to return emotions to where they really belong. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The idea that energy can be imported into a disagreement from elsewhere helps one: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Grasp when someone else is grappling with an issue that’s actually off the page. We can be more charitable to them. Their apparent venom or excessive heat is less disturbing. We understand that it’s really about something else and that’s very, very normal. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Be readier to apologise and reign yourself in. Ask yourself: am I importing energy? Because you understand that – without meaning to – you will sometimes be getting bothered by something quite different from the topic of disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-200314-cryA.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5351" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PM-200314-cryA.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="BEFORE MIDNIGHT - Jan 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Break deadlocks. Disagreements that seem stubborn could be managed if we could repatriate the energy on both sides. He says: I want the bedroom at 22 degrees Celsius. She says: I want it at 18. The repatriation solution looks elsewhere: it suggests that why people get so stubborn or entrenched in their positions can have other causes. For instance: he’s less willing to compromise on this, because he’s got to accept too many compromises at work. And she’s determined to win this one, because she always felt that her sister got to decide how things would be when they were children. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Saying that a disagreement is fuelled by imported energy can sound patronising. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There’s a danger that we’ll make an analysis of the origins of someone’s strong views which will inflame them further.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">They will ardently deny it has anything to do with their mother or situation at work – they will insist on the ‘higher’ cause (global politics etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The offence is unfounded: there’s nothing necessarily ‘high’ about passion derived from intellectual issues or ‘low’ about passion from more biographical issues.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Still, it’s not wise always to tell the other person what you think. Your diagnosis can’t necessarily be shared. But having it in mind, will stop you from fruitless antagonism. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>TRAUMA: AUDIT OF THE BIOGRAPHY OF IDEAS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The word trauma sounds dramatic, but all of us carry experiences of deep disturbance and threat around certain things. And these traumas often have a powerful, usually unacknowledged, impact on the way we think now.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our culture is under the spell of objective disagreement. We like to feel that we’re discussing facts and sifting evidence and constructing rational arguments. But when the pure debate about ideas is going badly – and disagreement seems bitter but fruitless – it can help to discuss the origins of ideas in our own lives. The ideal is to turn the conversation away from what this person thinks now and explore how it has come about that they hold the views they do. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study one</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Consider someone who is violently anti-conservative: anything that seems to support the status quo, or that is favourable to business, meets with extreme hostility. Arguing the other side (not everything that exists is bad, business is a major human activity) gets nowhere. Every suggestion you make is rejected. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Probing their background and early experiences might reveal that their father’s career was thrown into disarray in a period when a Conservative government was in power. It was a terrible time for their family. Their parents were very worried; their father felt humiliated. The government’s policies were implicated; cuts to state expenditure were a key factor in their father’s job being axed. It’s entirely understandable they feel the way they do. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study two</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You meet someone who is violently opposed to modern architecture in any form and insists that classical architecture is the only good kind. They sound slightly crazy on this topic. Instead of trying to persuade them that there might be at least a fair number of great modern buildings, you might ask about their early experiences of architecture. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"> It turns out that in their adolescence &#8211; when life felt dangerously chaotic &#8211; they’d been drawn to buildings that seemed very calm, quiet and dignified, and that these were all classical in style. There was a particular part of the city they lived in that they loved for this reason. Then a dramatic, assertive modern building went up just there (just about the time their parents divorced). It felt like a personal attack, it seemed to be destroying an imagined refuge.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459653584.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5352" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/459653584.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Thanksgiving Service At St Paul's" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The idea each of these people dislikes (conservatism, modern buildings) represents a<b><i> fear</i></b>. And the positions they espouse (Socialism, classicism) represent to them an <b><i>imagined solution</i></b>. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This is typical about many topics over which we disagree.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Once we accept this, we might still not see eye-to-eye about economics or architecture. But the person who opposes us no longer appears merely stubborn and narrow-minded: they have a fear and they have gravitated to an <b><i>imagined solution</i></b> – and we need to be aware of both of these moves&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By understanding the history that an idea or position occupies in someone’s mind, we grow better able to see some of the slightly haphazard, unfortunate associations it has picked up in their biography – but that don’t intrinsically belong to it. Modernist buildings are not really an attack on this person&#8217;s well-being. Conservatism doesn’t, on the whole, mean that people’s parents lose their jobs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>UNFORTUNATE INTRODUCTIONS TO IDEAS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Another way in which we can have difficulties reaching agreement is that we frequently encounter ideas via people. This means that certain dispositions get unnaturally tainted, depending on who introduced us to an idea, with negative auras which are then very, very hard to shift using the normal means of conversation. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We might have crucially encountered a line of thought via negative or frightening people; or (alternatively) it might have been unnaturally boosted by being advocated by someone who we loved and trusted – and now feel a need to be loyal to, so loyal as to preclude any disagreement with them or departure from their original ideologies. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case studies:</span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A very engaging, now dead uncle was immensely critical of trade unions and used to be very witty about their failings. You’ve never been able to take labour unions quite seriously since then and instinctively regard them with suspicion. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A lovely art teacher really admired Andy Warhol, who in their eyes was the consummate 20th-century artist. Doubts about his genius now strike you as provincial and offensive, and a betrayal of a very nice old friend.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1275384221.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5360" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/1275384221.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="Ron Galella Archive - File Photos 2011" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You knew an awkward, terribly shy person at college who was a devout Catholic. Without quite realising it, that’s become your standard picture of religious belief. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You knew an awkward, terribly shy person at college who was devoted to astronomy. Without quite realising it, this has become your standard picture of scientists. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Taking an audit of one’s own psychological intellectual history reveals the debt that one’s ideas owe to the accidents of personal experience. It’s not the issue in itself that we are responding to; we see it through a distorting filter.  We are blurring concepts and people. Our intellectual life runs the risk of being held hostage by these accidental associations, which don’t do any justice to the issues involved. </span></p>
<p class="p8"><strong><span class="s2">Exercise: </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">List ways in which an early trauma or personal association might have affected your own convictions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Now allow the concept to grow apart from the people who may have first introduced you to it.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We try to imagine the nicest person who might hold this view and how and why. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If one is anti trades-union, imagine a charming, civilised person who is all for them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/170400357.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5355" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/170400357.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="One Campaign's Agit8 Event At Tate Modern - Day 1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If one is anti-conservative, imagine the case being made by someone who is kindly and astute.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you despair of modern architecture, think of the defence that could be made for it by a serious, sweet natured and sensitive individual </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We don’t necessarily end up changing our own convictions. What changes is our mental picture of the disagreement. To feel that the other view can be held by an honourable and wise person doesn’t have to mean you give up your own beliefs. But it does mean that you can have a much more productive and interesting time. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>SURRENDER THE PLEASURES OF SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In theory we are not meant to like strong disagreement – the situation in which we tell ourselves the other person is very, very wrong in their opinions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But there’s a dark truth: instead of feeling uncomfortable, sometimes we actually like it very much. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It happens quite often around politics: one has the idea that those on the other side are terrible people – not simply in error but also cruel, selfish, short-sighted, stupid and dangerous. They are very bad people indeed. Leaving aside the truth of the matter about whether (say) Catalonia would be better off apart from Spain, whether integration with Europe is good or bad for the UK, the nature and urgency of climate change or the status of religious belief, these are all topics around which some people end up loathing and looking down on those on the other side. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Why is this actually rather tempting? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>Reason one:</strong> we get a reassuring encounter with our own convictions. We get a powerful feeling of being right (which is much more appealing than the sense that everything is murky and confusing). It is an antidote to melancholy and ambiguity. If the ‘enemy’ is evil, we must be good. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><strong>Reason two:</strong> the disagreement (in which we feel righteous and indignant) provides a conveniently precise – local – target for otherwise wide-ranging disappointment. Instead of feeling broadly dissatisfied with life and oneself there is now an explanation: this awful person, or these awful people.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">However pleasing self-righteousness can be, it’s deeply depressing in its effects, because it means one is actually giving up on the practical possibility of changing people’s minds or having one’s own mind changed. One is refusing to learn or to teach.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In order to reverse out of a position of self-righteousness, we need to perform an unusual manoeuvre. We need to remember what it was like not to have our present conviction. We need to imagine what it’s like not to agree with oneself. We need to empathise with someone who might not find what we think to be ‘obvious’ in any way apparent.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Successful persuasion relies on a memory of what it was like not to agree with one’s current stance.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marriage.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5356" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/marriage.jpg?resize=635%2C405" alt="Exhibition - 2013" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A standard exercise should run like this: pick a topic that you most easily feel you are absolutely right about (i.e. environment, taxation, drugs laws, pornography&#8230;). Argue against yourself in the most intelligent and sophisticated and sympathetic way that you can muster.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Disagreements often involve labelling the person one is in conflict with: ‘fascist’, idiot, bigot, neat freak, selfish. Such names cut us off from an account of what might really be going on in the head of the other person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If we want to cope better with disagreement (and feel less threatened by it, more at ease with it, and have a better chance of reaching an agreement) we need a more benevolent picture of the other person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>THE USES OF ART IN SOLVING DISAGREEMENT</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One way to lessen disagreement is to get people reading more novels and watching more of certain sorts of films.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The stories we need are those that explain how someone who at first seems utterly unworthy or our regard or understanding is, in fact, properly deserving of sympathy and empathy. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Charles Dickens was immensely effective at this. For example, in <i>David Copperfield</i>, he showed his Victorian contemporaries that (for instance) a convicted pickpocket was not necessarily some alien creature; but that there were many fearsomely plausible pathways to such conditions. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Over the course of the novel, we learn that David Copperfield is not the wretched and unsympathetic character that most middle-class Victorians would automatically have assumed he was if they’d spotted him in the street. They get to understand how a decent person – how might you, his reader – end up in his situation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_2059415a-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5379" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_2059415a-1.jpg?resize=635%2C449" alt="DAVID COPPERFIELD, Elizabeth Allan, Freddie Bartholomew, Jessie Ralph, 1935." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We can very usefully make the same kind of move around beliefs that we (perhaps vehemently) disagree with.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We need to ask the Copperfield Question: how could a good person end up here? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We sometimes get nervous around the move because it can feel too much like condoning that conviction. If I understand how a decent, nice person could be a Nazi or an admirer of Stalin, am I not edging towards saying it’s OK to be either of those things? </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">That fact is, you are not. On the contrary, you are now much better placed to see how to disengage them from those convictions. You have a better chance of teaching them. Because you understand what it is you have to do; and what they are motivated by. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Unfortunately, the media does not help, because generally it does the opposite of what good novels and films do. It builds up caricatures.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/486255457.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5365" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/486255457.jpg?resize=635%2C537" alt="Ukip's Nigel Farage Campaigns Before European Elections" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The media provides composite pictures of characters like the recent immigrant, the politician, the CEO and so on. And we use these shorthands to navigate our way through a complex world. They’re often not very good portraits.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And yet the media could be brilliant – and do what Dickens did with pickpockets: namely, humanise those with whom we can’t at first sympathise.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN CREATING ENEMIES</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">One major way in which technology makes it harder to understand your enemies (and so makes disagreement harder to deal with well) is by enabling high levels of anonymity.  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">People are nasty online for three basic reasons. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>First, the fear of not being heard at all</b> </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This encourages turning up the volume: by being shrill, abrasive, curt, rude… all of which are intensifiers, they attempt to get a message across distances which are smaller than they might imagine. And the fact is that their target is indeed liable to be hurt. From the perspective of the attacker, an insult might be the psychological equivalent of a raised voice. But for the person on the other side, it may provoke deep hurt and mental collapse.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Second, the sense of being anonymous</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We feel unobserved and therefore released from the constraints that arise when we are conscious that our friends and acquaintances or even just strangers will see what we are up to. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>Thirdly, it’s not a person on the other end</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We feel that the individual we are disagreeing with is not a whole person in our minds (just as the whole of ourselves is not being engaged by the encounter). We are ready to say things and express ourselves in a manner that we never would if we were speaking to someone face to face.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4798960691.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5377" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/4798960691.jpg?resize=635%2C367" alt="TURKEY-POLITICS-CORRUPTION-INTERNET-TWITTER-MASS-MEDIA" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Traditionally, violent disagreement in politics was tempered by a pivotal figure found in places like London, Paris, New York and Washington DC: the hostess.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Certain unfortunate associations of class, money and taste now separate us from any sympathy for this character, but we’d be wise to see what role hostesses used to play – which is that they would, at the end of a day of fierce disagreements in business and politics, draw adversaries together in the living room or by the bar – and introduce them to one another as people, rather than just as ideological cut outs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The role of the hostess was to introduce one to a sense that the enemy was a whole person, with compatible interests and tastes in other areas. They too might have kids, love football and take an interest in jazz. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Technology has put us at the opposite end of the spectrum from the moves of the hostess. Distance and dehumanisation have made us incomprehensible to one another. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>SNOBBERY</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Part of the reason we disagree with certain ideas and people in a very rigid and unhelpful way is that we are, in areas, desperately snobbish.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Snobbery is here defined as a tendency to judge people and ideas by certain criteria which blind us to their full complexity. The snob might decide that all right wing people are nasty or all Romanians are untrustworthy or everything to do with Existentialism is great (or terrible). </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We need to be aware of these snobbish blocks in which certain of our opinions are encased.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If Socrates applied (incognito) for a university post today, he’d get rejected. No Ph.D, no publications, teaching experience only in the market square, hasn’t been awarded any research grants. Or if Jesus turned up (in disguise, under an assumed name) at the Vatican, he’d be regarded as a heretic. They would be high profile victims of snobbery. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Snobbery is the powerful tendency to assume that good things – the things we need – have to come with certain kinds of packaging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/78623574.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5367" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/78623574.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="Socialites attend a country club wedding" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We are very sensitive to, and censorious of, certain cases of snobbery. We castigate the social snob who can’t imagine that someone is delightful if they didn’t go to a particular kind of school or have illustrious ancestors. Or who will write you off on learning you income bracket, where you live or seeing what kind of car you drive. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But snobbery is far more widespread than this. At heart, snobbery is an error of thinking. We disagree with things in too large blocks and disagree in rigid ways. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When we analyse snobbery this way we can see that it applies in some surprising cases.  It’s the same problem, only we haven’t given it the right name yet. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We say: no one from Oxbridge can be nice.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Or: everyone on the left is a dreamer.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Or: right wingers are nasty…</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">These are entrenched positions – which impoverish us. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>HUMOUR</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Intense disagreement tends to be marked by the absence of one very important quality: humour.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Humour is desperately important and useful because what it can do is introduce what is generally missing from passionate disagreements: perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What is a joke? It frequently features a redescription of a serious situation from an oblique or distant perspective, which teases out the latent absurdities or exaggerations in our normal view of it. Our laughter will be evidence that we acknowledge that we have drifted from moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Humour can be far from ‘silly’: it is an agent of moderation.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Conflict can be intensified by provocative descriptions. Think of language like this which stokes disagreement and the desire for vengeance:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">‘The brutal unbelievers are desecrating the sacred soil of the motherland’. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There is a long tradition of this kind of talk, what we might term rabble rousing rhetoric, and which exploits exactly our capacity to lose perspective.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But any description can change our perspective. And if it can do so for the worse (making the conflict or disagreement more intractable, more terrifying) it can also do so for the better &#8211; taking the heat out of it. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This is what (dark) humour often does. It brings out the latent absurdity in a situation which has unfairly grown violent or heated. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A couple squabbling over what time to order a taxi might be calmed by their child who steps in to hold up a picture of their Death Clock on an iPad:</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s4"><a href="http://www.deathclock.com/">www.deathclock.com</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Take this redescription of World War one: </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Because some people in large buildings are worried about what other people might be thinking of them and are anxious not to look foolish, pieces of paper are sent to lots of people in small buildings telling them to put on special kinds of clothes and walk in a certain way and travel, mainly, to France. Then they must live for quite a long time in the ground. Should they see anyone wearing hats of a special shape they must try to insert some metal under the skin of that person. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">George Bernard Shaw’s take on patriotism makes the same kind of move: a deflationary, but accurate, redescription:“Patriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it&#8230;” </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Imagine seeing this photo: with the caption: ‘You can’t see any borders from up here.’</span></p>
<p class="p9"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/s127e006561.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5368" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/s127e006561.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="s127e006561" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This to shake fierce nationalists from some of their conviction.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This absolutely isn’t to say that there might not be times when we need to be perfectly serious – and times when it is good to be elevated. The point is just that humorous deflation is a significant resource when disagreement is going badly. We’ve inherited essentially a legal attitude to conflict (which tries to work out who is right and what the evidence is). But often what we need is not to decide who is in the right but to defuse a conflict. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Laughter is a step away from hardened opposition. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>THE ROLE OF SEDUCTION AND REASSURANCE</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When people don’t agree with us, it is natural to respond in three ways:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To get angry with those on the other side: they are stupid.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To try to make them feel guilty for their wrong opinions: they are bad people.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">To get pedantic and lecture them in great detail: they are ignorant.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Those who oppose you may (sometimes) indeed be stupid, bad and ignorant. But telling people they are stupid, bad and ignorant has a very poor record as a means of changing people’s minds – which is, after all, what you want to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It tends, on the contrary, to harden attitudes and make people resent you. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Anger, pedantry and guilt are unsuccessful strategies because they ignore a crucial factor in disagreement. The person on the other side is holding on to a certain position in part because they are scared, disappointed and worried. They don’t want to be bullied, they are alarmed by our stance on an issue which seems so far from what they’d hoped, they’re wondering why they ever agreed to be with us – or why their social life includes people who have such opposed views to theirs.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Our disagreement is provoking fear and anxiety in them – and that’s in part why it’s very unhelpful to disagree back with them in a way that’s too hard, aggressive or impatient. Such moves don’t do anything to reduce the fear or soothe the anxiety. If we really want people to agree we should, instead, make use of reassurance and seduction. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Reassurance </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It’s easy at once to imagine that the person who is disagreeing violently in a relationship is <i>mean</i> or odd. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And hence one feels sorely tempted to make them <b><i>see</i></b> just how mean and odd they are – in the simple (and terribly natural) conviction that this will lead to a good outcome. If only they could be made to see how appalling they are, then they’d become nice. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><strong><span class="s2">Case study: Refugees in Australia </span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Recently (August 2014) the Refugee Council for Australia put out a statement: </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">As we continue to push away those who seek our help, we risk becoming known as a mean and small-minded nation indifferent to the global challenges of forced displacement. It is high time for Australia to make a real contribution. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">The Council for Refugees is describing the majority view as ‘mean and small minded’ &#8211; which could be true &#8211; but it isn’t likely to win support. In fact, it makes it extremely easy for the government (which is backed by the majority) to paint the Council as arrogant, disloyal and out of touch. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">In spite of the efforts of the Council and a large number of parallel pressure groups &#8211; <em>The Sydney Morning Herald</em> reports that “A strong majority of Australians, 60 per cent, want the government to “increase the severity of the treatment of asylum seekers.”</span></p>
<p class="p10"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456115410.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5369" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/456115410.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Protesters Gather Outside The Australian Embassy In Cambodia Ahead Of Refugee Deal" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What’s missing in attempting to calm the disagreement of anti-asylum seekers is a more sympathetic understanding of <i>why</i> people take the view they do on such a topic: an acknowledgement that those who hate asylum seekers might be afraid and worried, rather than mean and unintelligent. The fears have to be acknowledged and taken seriously first, before anyone can change their mind. If you don’t do that your advocacy simply adds to the anxiety and makes the other person <i>less</i> likely to agree with you. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reassurance doesn’t mean saying ‘I know you are afraid’ – which can sound patronising. It starts with a genuine understanding of what the anxieties are – being swamped, ignored, envy that another will get special treatment when you don’t. And then offering a defence against these bad outcomes. Or explaining in terms that work for the other person why these things are not, in fact, going to happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We understand this intuitively when dealing with children. If a child is afraid there is a monster under the bed, we don’t think it’s wise to tell them not to be idiotic, cease complaining and grow up. We might examine what bothers them. We look under the bed, and get them to do so too. We might give them a bell to ring to bring us running if a monster should appear. We ask them about anything that might have bothered them during the day. We might even try cutting the legs off the bed. We don’t share the anxiety, but we do the child the honour of taking it very seriously. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Reassurance is also crucial in intimate disagreements. There’s a fatal tendency to see the single out-of-control disagreer (one’s partner) as mean – which mars many attempts to make headway in domestic life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Case study: the sofa</span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">A: ‘I think we should change the cover on that sofa; I was thinking of this &#8230;’ </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">B: ‘No, no, no. That’s totally disgusting, I hate that. Why are you doing this to me. You are always doing these terrible things .’</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">A: What have I done, I’ve only made a suggestion? </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">B: ‘Fuck off.’ </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The disturbingly intemperate person is not generally mean, they are, above all else, panicked and <b><i>scared</i></b>. Though as yet it is not at all clear what it is they are worried about. Panic here means an inability to calmly explain what it is that is really bothering you. It feels so urgent and so serious that the mind races to aggression. But somewhere, under the aggression, are genuine worries that perhaps can be identified and resolved. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">For instance, the agitated one might be (under the surface):</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Anxious about losing control of their life. It’s a real worry, but exaggerated in this one instance. So the move would be to trade off this choice for letting them have their way on something else. It&#8217;s not really the sofa cover they object to.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/129369066.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5370" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/129369066.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="Couple reading weekend newspapers at home, UK" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The proposed cover reminds them of one in a shared house they lived in as a student, in a very unhappy year. They don’t hate you, just a memory. They might be able to adjust, with some sympathetic encouragement. Or possibly not. But it’s a different, less confrontational, issue. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By taking seriously the possibility that the person you disagree with is scared, there’s a huge opportunity to shift the disagreement to more hopeful territory. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong><span class="s2">Seduction </span></strong></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In romantic terms, seduction involves being very, very attentive and nice, making the environment just right, saying sweet and exciting things. Seduction can be cynical. But at its best it is a generous art of helping another person overcome their nervousness. Ideally, the seducer helps the one they seduce. When we are seduced (ideally, again) we don’t go against our own best interest; on the contrary, we are deftly assisted to what we really do want, but didn’t have the confidence to pursue. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The honourable seducer knows that people get held back by shyness, nerves and self-doubt. And takes great pains to lull these unhelpful forces. Essentially the seducer possesses a highly important kind of confidence: they know that someone who is not yet convinced can be won over by consideration, warmth and tenderness. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Seduction has a role to play in public debate. Consider what can go wrong in its absence. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><strong><span class="s2">Case Study </span></strong></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">In 2009, the UK government announced that it was considering cuts to the public founding of Humanities courses. They were testing public opinion to see what kind of support for, or opposition to, such a move there might be. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">The government view was that the Humanities were a luxury, enjoyed by the few and therefore not something that really deserved to be paid for by public funds. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Many people were disturbed by this. <i>The Guardian</i> attacked this as ‘dark philistinism’. The Academy of the Humanities vilified the policies as ‘sterile and outdated.’ The National Union of Students complained that the policy was ‘short-sighted, reckless, socially and culturally barren and fixated on a mean and narrow ideology. They also noted, that the mainstream media had been entirely silent. It may have been the case that the policy was ‘philistine’ and ‘culturally barren’. </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s2">Although highly charged, those opposed to the cuts failed to move public opinion to their side. The following year many Humanities courses lost their public funding entirely. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The cause may have been a good one. But the advocacy was not at all seductive. It did not set out to woo people who might be a bit reluctant or not yet convinced.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/458165368.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5371" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/458165368.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Humanities students close a supermarket in the center of" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">There was no attempt to seduce someone who was a bit suspicious of the Humanities to see there might be a point in funding them.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At the root of seduction is the insight: In any disagreement, one must try to explain to the other person (or other group) what is so attractive and appealing about our position – rather than focusing on what is bad or wrong with theirs. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>STRATEGIC PESSIMISM</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Sometimes we can’t make headway in disagreement and therefore need to do that most unfamiliar and rather downbeat move: learn to live with disagreement. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This can feel extremely disappointing. There are some topics we tend to feel are too important for compromise. Typically, they are big political and social matters, which might include:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Climate change</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The economy</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Immigration</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Education</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">If you have strong opinions on these things, you are unlikely to think it’s just fine when others hold very different views. It feels crucial that the truth, as you see it, should prevail. You want things to change in the world. You might be very confident of the rightness of your own position. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">But what lends us this belief that the truth can prevail, that other people can be won around, that disagreement works?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When we disagree violently with some people (who we think of as fools and idiots), we are generally in a rather dark and gloomy mood about things. It would feel odd to describe us at this point as being <b><i>optimists</i></b>.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">And yet that’s precisely what we are and it is an optimism that is deeply dangerous – and something we should try to wean ourselves from. The passionate desire to get people to think as we do is born out of a naive belief that agreement can eventually be found on all great issues and that harmony is the natural state of things between people. Of course, right now we may be in a bit of a fight, but, so the optimistic arguer believer, with a few more assaults on the issue, the argument can be ironed out.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">At a political level, it is this sort of optimism which has belied great moments of institutional intolerance. The Soviet Experiment was so violent in part because it was so optimistic about agreement: it genuinely believed that – with a little more prodding and pushing – an entire nation could be made to agree with the principles of Lenin. One has to be a rather optimistic leader to set about torturing members of the opposition into agreement. The Gulag was an act of optimism.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">By contrast, modern democratic states are notably pessimistic in their structure about agreement. They know there will always be disputes and therefore, they have learnt to accommodate them. Citizens have the right to disagree, no one can coerce anyone else into belief, we’re often left alone to think what we want. There isn’t a constant quest for total universal approval.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158782062.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5374" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/158782062.jpg?resize=635%2C426" alt="US-POLITICS-ECONOMY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">All this is the fruit of pessimism. Pessimism takes as its starting point that agreement between people is actually not the normal order of things. Given how humans are, the possibility of large groups of people thinking the same thing is highly unlikely. We shouldn’t be surprised or indeed too depressed or angry about this – no more than we’d be sad about bad weather or the onset of a bad cold. These things happen. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Once disagreement starts to be seen as utterly normal, and agreement the rare and beautiful exception, we can stop being so surprised and therefore so passionately annoyed when we meet with someone who doesn’t see eye-to-eye with us.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The strategic pessimist also grasps that it’s very unlikely that one can ever rationally persuade people of something: people’s opinions are formed over long years, through emotional dynamics, and ten minutes of conversation over dinner is entirely unlikely to make any difference.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The pessimist therefore shifts the focus away from an attempt to convert to an attempt to endure and manage disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This involves two responses. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The first at the political level is:</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>a) Human Rights</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The modern state seeks to create structures that can contain and moderate disagreement.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">This gets expressed through the language of human rights. This means certain rights to liberty and freedom for the individual are guaranteed. The state cannot coerce, convince or bully the individual.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Citizens are also expected to leave one another alone. One has a lot of freedom from interference.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><b>b) Manners</b></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">What human rights accomplishes at the political level, manners accomplishes at the private level. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The mannered person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us. They believe deeply in getting on around other people. It is not that they are afraid of ruffling anyone’s feathers per se – but they just doubt whether it is ever really a constructive move and they are not interested in merely symbolic victories. They would prefer to have civil relations with someone rather than tell them frankly what is on their mind. They’re alive to how difficult it is for us to take on board challenging information from someone else. They accept an important role for secrets and white lies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461039834.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5372" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/461039834.jpg?resize=635%2C472" alt="Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu - Director General of UNESCO Irina Bokova" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The ideal hope is that disagreement can be resolved. Good manners aim at a lesser, but practically crucial goal: how to cope when disagreement won’t go away. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Politeness is a set of tactics for artificially reducing the feeling of conflict, in the absence of real agreement. Instead of being open and honest about how we feel, the well-mannered person will:  </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Thank someone to whom we do not feel especially grateful. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Smile, when they feel bored.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Laugh when they are not amused.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Say that an idea is interesting, when they think it is unimpressive.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Keep their opposition quiet.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Good manners are pessimistic; they build on an acceptance that </span>we can cope with not everyone agreeing with us (especially when we are in the right).</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">It might be too hard to reach agreement with this person.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">We have limited energy and should save it for the most important occasions.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Not every disagreement is worth resolving, even if the other person is dead wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Social peace is mostly better than conflict.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Being misunderstood is a normal part of life.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The key point is that rather than focus on the point of disagreement, manners encourage us to skirt round it, avoid it, and keep it out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your sister’s partner has a whole lot of ideas with which you strongly disagree. But you don’t see them very often. They don’t really listen to you. The fall out with your sister could be awful. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Your mother has some cherished views about art, religion and sex which you find deeply unconvincing. But they are very, very important to her. To try to talk her out of them would be cruel. You need to avoid disagreement in order to avoid needlessly hurting her. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">An old friend from college has some whacky convictions. But you don’t want to stop seeing them. They are a cherished link to that period of your life. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">A work colleague – at a reception – reveals some views about politics with which your are in profound disagreement. But, you are going to have to work with them all next month on a major project. It is crucial you maintain a viable working relationship. </span></p>

<p>Any occasion to improve ourselves should be seized upon. We need resolutions: they are promises we make to our better selves. In the future, we should try to worry less, forgive more, look at things through other people&#8217;s eyes and, most of all, learn to appreciate what we have.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modern society often tells us that we should learn to feel good about ourselves. Low self-esteem is out. We should be celebrating our goodness, talents and potential. Enough of having to feel ashamed of who we are and what we do.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerA1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4105" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerA1.jpg?resize=635%2C386" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Religions couldn’t agree less. All of them carve out moments in the diary when they want us to take stock of all the bad stuff we’re likely to have done, all the unthinking evil and carelessness we’re responsible for – and then they ask us to say sorry. We should look back over our behaviour and do that most unfamiliar and pre-modern thing: atone; that is, apologise for what an idiot and low-key monster one has been over the past few months.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerB1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4106" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerB1.jpg?resize=635%2C529" alt="ASH WEDNESDAY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Every year, Christians around the world mark Ash Wednesday; a central moment of atonement. Believers go to a priest and get a cross drawn on their forehead made out of the ashes of palm trees. It’s a public symbol of one’s commitment to saying sorry for the bad stuff one has done, a sign that one has entered a period of reflection and apology. It’s a deeply charming and useful ritual, from which the more self-satisfied bits of the secular world could learn a lot.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerC.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3803" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerC.jpg?resize=635%2C438" alt="Ash Wednesday Maryland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Religions accept that all of us are bad: that we are tempted to deceive, steal, insult, egoistically ignore others and be unfaithful pretty much all the time. The question is not whether we experience shocking temptations or do bad things, but whether we are able once in a while to rise above our awful sides, acknowledge them and say sorry for them. A public invitation to atone is meant to encourage us to inch towards moral improvement. Ash Wednesday teaches us that the faults we have are inevitable facts about being human and we must therefore admit to them candidly and attempt to rectify them in the light of day. It’s as if religions know that feeling that you’re meant to be innocent and good all the time is not helpful if you’re trying to become a better person. It makes us paralysed with guilt over our failure to measure up to impossibly high standards of integrity. It just makes us hypocrites. Far better to be told that we’re all bad, all likely to be mean and thoughtless, and then asked to say sorry – rather than cling on to ideas of our original purity. Confessions of universal sinfulness, symbolised by a black cross on your forehead, turn out to be a far better starting point from which to take the first modest steps towards being an OK person.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerD1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4109" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/PM-140314-sinnerD1.jpg?resize=635%2C558" alt="Ash Wednesday" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thinking one is great and kind all the time is simply not a good basis for actually being so. Whatever you think of religion, it understands this bit of our psyche pretty well.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Feeling grateful about the good aspects of our lives is something we all know we should do a bit more often. And yet there’s often something curiously uncomfortable, even maddening, about being reminded to do so.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In part, that’s because the call to be more grateful stands in deep conflict with a central drive in human nature: ambition. We know in theory that we should be grateful for what we have, but day to day, we are dominated by striving: for better relationships, working lives, communities and nations. The advocates of gratitude sound like they are recommending that we be content with how things already are. Mediocre situations could (these people seem to be saying) be so much worse. People in developed nations, irritated by the ineptitudes of their governments, should be more grateful that their politicians are not like those in Zimbabwe. Someone fed up with having a cough should be very glad they don’t have bronchitis…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2361" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/141759341.jpg" alt="Londoners Enjoy Spring Sunshine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1">Don’t remind me to be grateful</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This sort of thinking is deeply at odds with the underlying attitudes of modern societies. Capitalism stimulates constant ambition and longing and rewards astute, intense assaults on excellence. Restlessness is the precondition of progress. Nothing should be good enough for very long. The idea of being content with what we have and who we are has come to feel strange and dangerous. At best, gratitude appears like the consolation prize – the loser’s counsel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Furthermore, encouragement to be ‘grateful’ is not always the kindly act it seems. It may just be another person’s convenient way of disguising their fear of competition or their refusal to engage with the stress and turmoil of aspiration. The insistence that we be more grateful could just be a jealous friend’s way of sidestepping our anxieties while ennobling their lack of effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s why it is so deeply important to hear exhortations to be grateful – to appreciate what we have and to recognise the value of simple, natural things – from people who understand a lot about striving and effort and who have not fallen into gratitude simply from a lack of initiative or strength. To trust the message, we have to trust the motives, experiences and character of the person telling us to be grateful – just as the reminder to be faithful in love gains weight when it comes from someone who has had every option to explore multiple partners. To be convincing, gratitude needs to be in a constructive dialectical relationship with aspiration. The call to gratitude isn’t for everyone at all times. It is a corrective for those among us who are in danger of overplaying ambition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel.jpg?resize=624%2C480" alt="Rom_Capitol_Marc_Aurel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"></h5>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">The Roman Emperor and philosopher, Marcus Aurelius, was a most convincing guide to gratitude  &#8211; because he knew so much about power and success. We therefore take note when he points out that we should be deeply grateful for a sunny day, a tasty piece of fruit and a summer evening when it’s warm enough to sit outside without extra layers. In his hands, we recognise that gratitude does not have to be a polite way of opting out of ambition.</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is equally important to know that the advocates of gratitude aren’t merely being naïve when they tell us to stop and appreciate flowers or a pretty sky; they know about suffering and darkness and are speaking up only because they have been to hell and back and concluded that in the end, what makes the journey worth it are a few outwardly humble but deeply significant things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why do we grow ungrateful in the first place? Fear may have something to do it. There is in many of us a fear of enjoying the present moment – as if to pause to appreciate a flower or the rapid movement of clouds over the horizon might make us ‘soft’ and leave us open to fatal complacency and grievously sap our will to take on bigger challenges. We are prone to make an odd and deeply unfortunate connection between safety and a mood of anxious dissatisfaction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our mood is also frequently affected by who and what we are implicitly comparing ourselves with. And though we’re not generally clear what our comparison points are (we build them up unconsciously and don’t take the opportunity to question them often enough), we are prone to comparisons that are deeply unfair to our achievements and strengths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Much of the problem comes down to our images of what is ‘normal’ – distributed through society by the media. Take someone who might be deeply dissatisfied with their appearance on the basis of the models they have seen. But the beauty of models is as rare as the violence of mass murderers. The problem is, we tend to think there are far more murders than there are. Three stories of stabbings in a week make it feel as if everyone is knifing everyone else. We have to remind ourselves that, though people do get stabbed and some have perfect faces, these things are extraordinarily rare. We recognise symptoms of panic when the frequency of bad things is exaggerated. We don’t yet recognise the dissatisfaction that arises when the frequency of very attractive things (superlative relationships, careers, bodies) is overplayed. We grow ungrateful because we are, among other things, very poor statisticians.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonB.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4116" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-290114-huntingtonB.jpg?resize=635%2C386" alt="Rosie Huntington-Whiteley looking fashionable while out and about in NYC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Not normal at all</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to fight images of false glamour, to throw the spotlight on people, scenes and activities which deserve far more prestige than they are currently given. Of course, it can be hard to see beauty and interest in the things we have to do everyday and in the environments where we live. We have jobs to go to, bills to pay, homes to clean and keep running and we deeply resent the demands they make on us. They seem to be pulling us away from our real ambitions, getting in the way of a better life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Art, and art galleries, seem far away from all this: they are for a day off, somewhere to visit on holiday. But art can occasionally usefully remind us that the circumstances of our lives are not as discredited and uninteresting as we are used to thinking. Art can be a prime agent of gratitude, a corrective of false glamour, when we learn to look at our world as certain great artists have looked at theirs. Take the Dutch 17th-century painter Pieter de Hooch, an artist deeply alive to the value of simple moments of domestic life, of the kind most of us know from our own routines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-110314-houseworkA2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4118" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/PM-110314-houseworkA2.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="PM-110314-houseworkA2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">We have been in similar situations before, by the washing machine, without gratitude</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The linen closet itself could easily be resented. It is an embodiment of what could, under an unhelpful influence, be seen as boring, banal, repetitive… But the picture moves us because we recognise the truth of its message. If only, like de Hooch, we knew how to recognise the value of quiet domesticity, many of our burdens would be lifted. It gives voice to the right attitude: the big themes of life – the search for prosperity, happiness, good relationships – start with the way we approach little things. It’s a hard message to hold on to, because we are constantly being told other things. This painting is small in a competitive, status-conscious world – but that many people revere it is hopeful, for it signals that we know, deep down, that de Hooch is onto something important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2368" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/T12219_10.jpg" alt="A View from an Apartment 2004-5 by Jeff Wall born 1946" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">A View from an Apartment 2004-5 by Jeff Wall born 1946</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Canadian photographer Jeff Wall, like Pieter de Hooch several centuries before, is alive to the charm of an ordinary day, hanging out at home, sorting stuff out. Here too there are reasons for gratitude</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To say that we should be more grateful is not to deny a role for future effort. It is to recognise that there are already at this point some very good reasons to be a little more satisfied with who we are and what we have. A failure to draw pleasure from our current circumstances is an indication of a problem which will likely dog us even if we reach the pinnacle of all our ambitions. Our problem is not not having enough: it is not daring to relax our guard long enough to draw pleasure from any advantage per se.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/169021616.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4996" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/169021616.jpg?resize=635%2C430" alt="Tour of California - Stage 7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">The ultimate road to gratitude</h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a flexibility about how we tell our stories. It isn’t just one thing that has ever happened to us, there are different angles from which we might come at the same material (what we call being depressed is, at heart, an inability to alter our narrative methods). Compared with some ideals of success, our lives have of course invariably been disasters. We made some serious errors, we lacked courage, we were lazy, we unwittingly upset important people, we messed up… But it is in the end no great achievement simply to locate and fixate on failure. There should be prestige too in being able to identify a forgiving, hopeful perspective; in knowing how to be a friend to oneself. We need moments of gratitude because our greatest responsibility is to endure; to identify reasons not to end it prematurely when it might at first glance make so much sense to do so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The ultimate corrective is to compare oneself with the dead. By that final standard, so many aspects of life are to be cherished, even what we now consider imperfections. We are constantly undermined by our failure to retain the purity and drama of that insight – which might strike us at a funeral or when driving past a smash up on the motorway – and put it to powerful use in the ordinary bustle of life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is by redrawing our unconscious frames of comparison more accurately that our lives start to appear in a more benign, and more valuable, light. Gratitude is the dividend that is due to us when we forego false images of normality and begin to assess our lives against stark but liberating statistical realities.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Most weeks, someone mistreats us in a greater or lesser way: they overlook a commitment they’ve made, they let us down logistically, they betray our hopes or deceive our trust. And on a macro scale, similarly sombre dynamics play themselves out on the public stage: politicians act dishonourably, business leaders plunder and fool us, the young show no respect, and criminals bully and terrify the vulnerable.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are so many good reasons to settle into an unforgiving mood. For a start, most of the bad things we see are so far removed from anything we could ever contemplate doing, it feels like there is simply no point attempting to understand or to empathise with the wrongdoers. We shake our heads and wonder how some people get to be the way they are. We use words like weirdo and pervert. The conclusion is that these people must just be ‘bad’ and that it is a delusion of the liberal mind to insist on anything more complex. Furthermore, forgiving enemies, though it looks charitable, appears to be the last resort of the weak, something one tries to do when a lack of will power has left one with no other option but to look past the offences of our enemies. A certain bullish unforgiving attitude promises protection against chaos and social disintegration. A civilisation cannot survive too much softness towards evil.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in the end, a lack of forgiveness is a mood, a filter we apply to reality, and like most moods, it needs regular audiences with its opposite – and because forgiveness is ultimately the harder of the pair, the one that comes least naturally to all of us, it is the emotion that calls for most attention: it is the one we need consciously to exercise and rehearse, as we would the flexing of an underused muscle. We should do so because we cannot sustain relationships or working lives or be members of a community and the carers of children without regularly being able to draw on significant reserves of forgiveness. Not getting bitter, not seeking revenge, not telling others everything on one’s mind, not trying to get equal even when one has every right to do so; these constructive moves need all the support and encouragement a society can muster.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The path to forgiveness always begins in the same place: with the recognition of one’s own sinful nature. Certainly one may never have done this or that truly dreadful thing upon which one’s sense of outrage currently rests. But, so the forgiving attitude insists, one has done something, indeed many things that are on a continuum with, or in some ways related to, the horrors one is currently condemning with force. One might never have cheated on a tax form, physically hurt anyone or directly stolen someone’s property, but one has – inevitably – told lies and hurt, deceived and humiliated, bullied and evaded; one has been guilty of a thousand everyday sins endemic to us all. A clean conscience is only a possibility for the callously unimaginative. To get by, we all need to rely on the forgiveness of countless others – ex-partners, parents, colleagues, friends – people who did not at a variety of moments exact the full revenge that might have been their due. Our survival is predicated on a great many others having – at key moments – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To adopt a forgiving attitude involves going beyond a pat belief in purely ‘evil’ motives. The very category of evil fragments awkwardly upon closer examination. What we call evil invariably reveals origins in hurt, weakness, tiredness, madness, desperation and folly. Understood fully, we are always more demented than bad. The furious, swearing father isn’t a monster; he is someone who did not gain sufficient reassurance in childhood, who is carrying untold anxieties from work, who is exhausted, who is a fool and who in his calmer moments, harbours a capacity to be deeply ashamed of his short temper and appalled at having damaged those he loves. Empathy towards the perpetrator doesn’t entail that one has for even a moment forgotten the victim, simply that one is committed to doing justice to psychological reality. The roots of awful behaviour lie – far more often than the unforgiving can admit – in terror and anxiety. Faced with the antics of our species, one should be moved more to profound pity than to indignation, more to sorrow than to fury.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2354" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/81195132.jpg" alt="Children play on a swing set on a summer day" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know how to practise this attitude, for we already do it all the time quite naturally with children. Faced with an example of a child’s violence or unreason, we know to ask at once whether they are tired or have eaten enough, whether they are worried or are being hurt by someone else. We don’t need to learn the lessons of forgiveness from scratch, we need merely to expand the range of people to whom we are willing to apply them. At moments of tension in domestic life, we should take a moment to think of those pictures of one’s partner as a six-year-old, perhaps on a swing in the garden or waiting with a nervous smile outside school. It becomes harder, crucially harder, to be outraged and miffed by their present conduct once one has been reminded of where this person began.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It also helps to recognise that forgiveness is not just the recourse of the weak. It reaches its most admirable and moving form precisely when it manifests itself in the strong, when it is recognised as a sign of maturity and inner confidence, a symptom of greatness of heart and sanity of mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Forgiveness deserves glamour. Religions once knew this. Buddhism, Judaism and Christianity all sought in different ways to induce and reinforce our tentative inclinations to forgiveness. The poetry read out in synagogue on the Jewish Day of Atonement, the song cycles of Eastern Buddhism, the tender melancholy of Bach’s St John’s Passion, these were meant to fill the hearts of their audiences with compassion for the follies of humankind. If we now seldom feel moved to forgiveness, we should recognise what a gap the disappearance of religion from public life has created and what help we may need from the surrounding culture to access the most constructive parts of our own nature. We need our tentative propensity to forgiveness to be publicly endorsed and rehearsed – not least in art.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2355" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/640px-Entrega_de_las_llaves_a_San_Pedro_Perugino.jpg" alt="640px-Entrega_de_las_llaves_a_San_Pedro_Perugino" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is often a fear that to forgive is to risk the good order of society. But in reality, if one always seeks to extract full justice, civilisation (and, at a more minor level, marriages, relationships, friendships and business ties) will not be able to continue. History shows that well-functioning societies require heroic moves of forgiveness on the part of groups that have been horribly wronged, in order that life can progress and other matters attended to. One needs to learn the art of overlooking, the genius of pretending not to have noticed. It means giving mean people too great a role in life never to forgive them, it allows them to hold our minds indefinitely hostage to their sadism. It allows the enemy to win. Forgiveness constitutes the true victory over the bad and is the ultimate marker of strength and courage.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It is one of the seven virtues of Christianity. It used to have a central place in Roman ethics and Judaism as well. Today, we remain deeply impressed by the idea of charity, but often from a distance, without probing the concept too deeply, with little attempt to practise it systematically. It’s something we might have recourse to when we’re moved by a documentary on the TV or have some loose change left over after the holidays.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1074" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/timetogive.jpg" alt="Retailers Hope For A Good Christmas Despite The Current Economic Gloom" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At its most basic, charity means: giving someone something they need but can’t get for themselves. And normally that’s understood to mean something material. We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving money.</span></p>
<p class="p2">The heroes of Christianity are exemplars of such charity. Outside the city, Saint Francis comes across a poor man. His garments are thin and ragged. Winter is coming on and coats are expensive. The saint is moved to charity.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4122" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/poorknight1700-616x1024.jpg?resize=635%2C511" alt="poorknight1700-616x1024" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But, at its core, charity goes far beyond finance. It is about recognising that a person needs help with something that they can’t do for themselves – and that their helplessness is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is part of the human condition. We freely give because we appreciate how often we wouldn’t have made it if other people had not – at key points, in different contexts – cut us some slack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is in relationships that charity becomes particularly necessary. Here we don’t generally require the charity of money, cloaks and free meals. What we are short of is charity of interpretation: that is, a charitable perspective on our weaknesses, eccentricities, anxieties and follies – failings that we are unable to explain or win sympathy for, that we merely act out, with immaturity and hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1076" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sweat.jpg" alt="Poor Dad" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It might be that one person in a couple has badly messed up in their professional life. They made a significant decision at work that played out badly. They got severely criticised; there was talk of court action. For months, they were very agitated, and hard to live with. They couldn’t articulate their fears. They were sullen and irascible. Their partner might have added stern admonitions to those of the regulator, the senior management and people on Twitter… They could have concluded that their partner was inept, greedy, maybe a bit unprincipled.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But instead, a charitable soul does the work the partner has not been able to do. They do the explaining for them. They understand enough about their past to have a picture of where their impatience and over-ambition came from. They hold in mind what happened with their parents and with the move to another country and with the brother who died too young. They lend a picture of who the ‘beggar’ is that is sufficiently generous and complex as to make them more than just the ‘fool’ or ‘weirdo’  they could so easily have been dismissed as.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4124" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/hug1.jpg?resize=635%2C355" alt="Romantic Paris" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The genuinely charitable person gives generously from a sense that they too stand in need of charity. Not right now, not over this, but in some other area. They know that self-righteousness is merely the result of a faulty memory, an inability to hold in mind – at moments when one is totally right – how often one has been deeply and definitively in the wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Charity remembers how there might still be goodness amidst a lot of evil. Charity keeps in mind that if someone is tired and stressed, they are liable to behave appallingly. Charity is aware that when someone shouts an insult they are not usually revealing the secret truth about their feelings. They are trying to wound the other because they feel they have been hurt – usually by someone else, whom they don’t have the authority to injure back.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Charity is interested in mitigating circumstances; in bits of the truth that can cast a less catastrophic light on our follies.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In financial matters, charity tends always to flow in one direction. The philanthropist may be very generous, but usually they stay rich; they are habitually the giver rather than the recipient. But in life as a whole, and especially in relationships, charity is unlikely ever to end up being one-sided: who is weak and who is powerful changes rapidly and frequently. You are likely to be, as it were, a patron in one area and a beggar in another. So we must be kind not only because we are touched by the suffering of others but because we properly understand that we too will soon be in urgent need of an equally vital dose of charity in some other part of life.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It’s one of the grandest and oddest words out there, so lofty, it doesn’t sound like something one could ever consciously strive to be – unlike say, being cultured, or kind. Others could perhaps compliment you on being it, but it wouldn’t be something you could yourself ever announce you had become.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nevertheless, though it’s impossible ever to reach a stable state of wisdom, as an aspiration, wisdom deserves to be rehabilitated and take its place among a host of other, more typical goals one might harbour.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2288" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/chinese-1.jpg" alt="CHINA-ECONOMY" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s woven from many strands:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">REALISM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are, first and foremost, ‘realistic’ about how challenging many things can be. They aren’t devoid of hope (that would be a folly of its own), but they are conscious of the complexities entailed in any project: for example, raising a child, starting a business, spending an agreeable weekend with the family, changing the nation, falling in love… Knowing that something difficult is being attempted doesn’t rob the wise of ambitions, but it makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic about the problems that will invariably come their way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">GRATITUDE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Properly aware that much can and does go wrong, the wise are unusually alive to moments of calm and beauty, even extremely modest ones, of the kind that those with grander plans rush past. With the dangers and tragedies of existence firmly in mind, they can take pleasure in a single, uneventful, sunny day, or some pretty flowers growing by a brick wall, the charm of a three-year-old playing in a garden or an evening of banter among a few friends. It isn’t that they are sentimental and naive, precisely the opposite: because they have seen how hard things can get, they know how to draw the full value from the peaceful and the sweet – whenever and wherever these arise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pram.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4128" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pram.jpg?resize=635%2C399" alt="Giuseppe Ungaretti on a bench in a park smiles at a child in the cradle" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FOLLY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise know that all human beings, themselves included, are deeply sunk in folly: they have irrational desires and incompatible aims, they are unaware of a lot, they are prone to mood swings, they are visited by all kinds of fantasies and delusions – and are always buffeted by the curious demands of their sexuality. The wise are unsurprised by the ongoing co-existence of deep immaturity and perversity alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes. Aware that at least half of life is irrational, they try – wherever possible – to budget for madness and are slow to panic when it (reliably) rears its head.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriously. They hedge their pronouncements, they are sceptical in their conclusions. Their certainties are not as brittle as those of others. They laugh from the constant collisions between the noble way they’d like things to be, and the demented way they in fact often turn out.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2290" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/folly.jpg" alt="Scientist Identifies Happiest Day of Year" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">POLITENESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are realistic about social relations, in particular, about how difficult it is to change people’s minds and have an effect on their lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">They are therefore extremely reticent about telling people too frankly what they think. They have a sense of how seldom it is useful to get censorious with others. They want – above all – that things be nice between people, even if this means they are not totally authentic. So they will sit with someone of an opposite political persuasion and not try to convert them; they will hold their tongue at someone who seems to be announcing a wrong-headed plan for reforming the country, educating their child or directing their personal life. They’ll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others and will search more for what people have in common than what separates them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2291" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/turkey.jpg" alt="Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt (R)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">SELF-ACCEPTANCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise have made their peace with the yawning gap between how they would ideally want to be and what they are actually like. They have come to terms with their idiocies, flaws, ugliness, limitations and drawbacks. They are not ashamed of themselves – and therefore, don’t have to lie or dissemble in front of others. Without self-love or vanity, they can give those close to them a fairly accurate map of their neuroses and faults and of the reasons why they will be hard to live around (and therefore often aren’t such difficult companions).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2292" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/mirror.jpg" alt="Eyes of the poet Alfonso Gatto are reflected in a rearview mirror" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">FORGIVENESS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are realistic about other people too. They recognise the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests and seek their own pleasures. It can make others appear extremely ‘mean’ and purposefully evil, but this would be to over-personalise the issue. The wise know that most hurt is not intentional, it’s a by-product of the constant collision of blind competing egos in a world of scarce resources.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise are therefore slow to anger and judge. They don’t leap to the worst conclusions about what is going on in the minds of others. They will be readier to forgive from a proper sense of how difficult every life is: harbouring as it does so many frustrated ambitions, disappointments and longings. The wise appreciate the pressures people are under. Of course they shouted, of course they were rude, naturally they want to overtake on the inside lane… The wise are generous to the reasons for which people might not be nice. They feel less persecuted by the aggression and meanness of others, because they have a sense of where it comes from: a place of hurt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2293" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/boys.jpg" alt="Perry Street Prep Pride Rugby" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">RESILIENCE</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know just how much can go wrong and things will still be – just about – liveable. The unwise person draws the boundaries of their contentment far too far out: so that it encompasses, and depends upon, fame, money, personal relationships, popularity, health… The wise person sees the advantages of all of these, but also knows that they may – before too long, at a time of fate’s choosing – have to draw the borders right back and find contentment within a more bounded space.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">ENVY</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise person doesn’t envy idly: they realise that there are some good reasons why they don’t have many of the things they really want. They look at the tycoon or the star and have a decent grasp of why they didn’t ever make it to that level. It looks like just an accident, an unfair one, but there were in fact some logical grounds: they didn’t work as hard, they don’t have anything like the drive or mental capacity…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2300" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/3135259.jpg" alt="Little Winners" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the same time, the wise see that some destinies are truly shaped by nothing more than accident. Some people are promoted randomly. Companies that aren’t especially deserving can suddenly make it big. Some people have the right parents. The winners aren’t all noble and good. The wise appreciate the role of luck and don’t curse themselves overly at those junctures where they have evidently not had as much of it as they would have liked.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise emerge as realistic about the consequences of winning and succeeding. They may want to win as much as the next person, but they are aware of how many fundamentals will remain unchanged, whatever the outcome. They don’t exaggerate the transformations available to us. They know how much we remain tethered to some basic dynamics in our personalities, whatever job we have or material possession we acquire. This is both cautionary (for those who succeed) and hopeful (for those who won’t). The wise see the continuities across those two categories over-emphasised by modern consumer capitalism: ‘success’ and ‘failure’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">REGRETS</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In our ambitious age, it is common to begin with dreams of being able to pull off an unblemished life, where one can hope to get the major decisions – in love and work – right.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the wise realise that it is impossible to fashion a spotless life; one will make some extremely large and utterly uncorrectable errors in a number of areas. Perfectionism is a wicked illusion. Regret is unavoidable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But regret lessens the more we see that error is endemic across the species. One can’t look at anyone’s life story without seeing some devastating mistakes etched across it. These errors are not coincidental but structural; they arise because we all lack the information we need to make choices in time-sensitive situations. We are all, where it counts, steering almost blind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2295" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bench.jpg" alt="Couple Sitting on a Bench" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1">CALM</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The wise know that turmoil is always around the corner – and they have come to fear and sense its approach. That’s why they nurture such a strong commitment to calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement. A day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. They are not afraid of having a somewhat boring time. There could, and will again, be so much worse…</span></p>
