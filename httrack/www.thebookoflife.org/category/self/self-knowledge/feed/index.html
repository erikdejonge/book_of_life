				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Ancient Greece, the philosopher Socrates famously declared that the unexamined life was not worth living. Asked to sum up what all philosophical commandments could be reduced to, he replied: ‘Know yourself.’</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing yourself has extraordinary prestige in our culture. It has been framed as quite literally the meaning of life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9892" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Socrates_and_Alcibiades_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg-1.jpg?resize=550%2C635" alt="Socrates_and_Alcibiades,_Christoffer_Wilhelm_Eckersberg (1)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This sounds, when one hears it, highly plausible, yet so plausible it’s worth pausing to ask a few more questions. Just why is self-knowledge such a prestigious good? What are the dangers that come with a lack of self-knowledge? And what do we in fact need to know about ourselves? How do we come to learn such things? And why is self-knowledge difficult to attain?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we speak about self-knowledge, we’re alluding to a particular kind of knowledge &#8211; generally of an emotional or psychological kind. There are a million things you </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">could</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> potentially know about yourself. Here are some options:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> On what day of the week were you born?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Were you able to pick up a raisin between your fore-finger and thumb when you were five months old? </span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Are you more an introvert or an extrovert?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> How does your relationship with your father influence your career ambitions?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What kind of picnic person are you: morning or evening? River-bank, park or hill?</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9902" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k.jpg?resize=559%2C612" alt="14383273638_bce4fe94c6_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of us would recognise that questions 3 and 4 are ones worth knowing; the others, not so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, not everything that we can know about ourselves is all that important to find out. Here we want to focus on the areas of self-knowledge that matter most in life: the areas concerned with the inner psychological core of the self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key bits of self-knowledge we’ll be interested in are:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what kind of person are you characteristically attracted to in love</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what difficult patterns of behaviour are you prey to in relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what are your talents at work</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what problems do you have around success/failure</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- how are you about feedback</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what do you do when you have been frustrated by life</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- what kind of taste do you have</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- can you distinguish between your passing bodily-based emotions and your more rational thoughts</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8894271237_e995848419_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9904" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8894271237_e995848419_z.jpg?resize=427%2C640" alt="8894271237_e995848419_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have solid answers to these issues, you’ll be able to speak of yourself as someone with an adequate degree of self-knowledge.</span></p>
<p><b>ONE: WHY AND WHERE DOES SELF-KNOWLEDGE MATTER?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge is important for one central reason: because it offers us a route to greater happiness and fulfilment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lack of self-knowledge leaves you open to accident and mistaken ambitions.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with the right sort of self-knowledge, we have a greater chance of avoiding errors in our dealings with others and in the formulation of our life choices.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3171111654_f6d6a53495_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9906" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3171111654_f6d6a53495_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3171111654_f6d6a53495_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at some examples of areas where self-knowledge matters</span></p>
<p><strong>LOVE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, all sorts of problems may occur:</span></p>
<p><em>1. Choosing the wrong partner: We try to get together with people who don’t really suit us, because we don’t understand our needs</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When first looking out for a partner, the requirements we come up with are coloured often by a beautiful non-specific sentimental vagueness: we’ll say we really want to find someone who is ‘kind’ or ‘fun to be with’, ‘attractive’ or ‘up for adventure…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It isn’t that such desires are wrong, they are just not remotely precise enough in their understanding of what we in particular are going to require in order to stand a chance of being happy – or, more accurately, not consistently miserable.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4173018804_32c461c5d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9911" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4173018804_32c461c5d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4173018804_32c461c5d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of us are crazy in very particular ways. We’re distinctively neurotic, unbalanced and immature, but don’t know quite the details because no one ever encourages us too hard to find them out. An urgent, primary task of any lover is therefore to get a handle on the specific ways in which they are mad. They have to get up to speed on their individual neuroses. They have to grasp where these have come from, what they make them do – and most importantly, what sort of people either provoke or assuage them. A good partnership is not so much one between two healthy people (there aren’t many of these on the planet), it’s one between two demented people who have had the skill or luck to find a non-threatening conscious accommodation between their relative insanities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The very idea that we might not be too difficult as people should set off alarm bells in any prospective partner. The question is just where the problems will lie: perhaps we have a latent tendency to get furious when someone disagrees with us, or we can only relax when we are working, or we’re a bit tricky around intimacy after sex, or we’ve never been so good at explaining what’s going on when we’re worried. It’s these sort of issues that – over decades – create catastrophes and that we therefore need to know about way ahead of time, in order to look out for people who are optimally designed to withstand them. A standard question on any early dinner date should be quite simply: ‘And how are you mad?’</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/285967033_1bb1bc0648_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9913" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/285967033_1bb1bc0648_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="285967033_1bb1bc0648_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem is that knowledge of our own neuroses is not at all easy to come by. It can take years and situations we have had no experience of. Prior to marriage, we’re rarely involved in dynamics that properly hold up a mirror to our disturbances. Whenever more casual relationships threaten to reveal the ‘difficult’ side of our natures, we tend to blame the partner – and call it a day. As for our friends, they predictably don’t care enough about us to have any motive to probe our real selves. They only want a nice evening out. Therefore, we end up blind to the awkward sides of our natures. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On our own, when we’re furious, we don’t shout, as there’s no one there to listen – and therefore we overlook the true, worrying strength of our capacity for fury. Or we work all the time without grasping, because there’s no one calling us to come for dinner, how we manically use work to gain a sense of control over life – and how we might cause hell if anyone tried to stop us. At night, all we’re aware of is how sweet it would be to cuddle with someone, but we have no opportunity to face up to the intimacy-avoiding side of us that would start to make us cold and strange if ever it felt we were too deeply committed to someone. One of the greatest privileges of being on one’s own is the flattering illusion that one is, in truth, really quite an easy person to live with. With such a poor level of understanding of our characters, no wonder we aren’t in any position to know who we should be looking out for.</span></p>
<p><em>2. We repeat unhealthy patterns from childhood, always latching on to people who will frustrate us in familiar but grievous ways</em></p>
<p>We believe we seek happiness in love, but it’s not quite that simple. What at times it seems we actually seek is familiarity – which may well complicate any plans we might have for happiness. We recreate in adult relationships some of the feelings we knew in childhood. It was as children that we first came to know and understand what love meant. But unfortunately, the lessons we picked up may not have been straightforward. The love we knew as children may have come entwined with other, less pleasant dynamics: being controlled, feeling humiliated, being abandoned, never communicating, in short: suffering. As adults, we may then reject certain healthy candidates whom we encounter, not because they are wrong, but precisely because they are too well-balanced (too mature, too understanding, too reliable), and this rightness feels unfamiliar and alien, almost oppressive. We head instead to candidates whom our unconscious is drawn to, not because they will please us, but because they will frustrate us in familiar ways. We get together with the wrong people because the right ones feel wrong – undeserved; because we have no experience of health, because we don’t ultimately associate being loved with feeling satisfied.<strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We fail to explain our feelings to our partners &#8211; because we don’t understand ourselves well enough. We act out our feelings rather than spell them out, often to destructive effect. (we break the door rather than explain we are mad with anger).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are unaware of the effects of our words on others. We don’t notice how often we say critical things to them or how often.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t anticipate and signpost our feelings: when we start to get over-excited and talk too fast, we should know it’s time to go for a walk round the block because otherwise there’s liable to be an explosion&#8230; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We project&#8217;, that is, we respond to events in the here and now according to patterns laid down in childhood; in our heads, our partners become mixed up with other people from our emotional history (a humiliating mother, a distant father etc…).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re governed by the past: old unfortunate habits keep their grip. We don’t see what’s happening and so we can’t do anything about it.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9916" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5979638083_cd2e9112e9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s a lot we can do once people are able to tell us what’s problematic about themselves. We don’t need people to be problem free &#8211; we need people to be able to explain where the problems are.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>WORK</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many ways in which a shortfall of self-knowledge is an obstacle to flourishing around work: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We only have a few short years in which to come up with a convincing answer about what we want to do with our lives. Then, wherever we are in the thought-process, we have to jump into a job in order to have enough money to survive or appease society’s demands for our productivity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, we are too vague about our ambitions; we don’t know what to do with our lives and &#8211; because money tends to be such an urgent priority &#8211; we lock ourselves into a cage from which it may take decades to emerge.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are too modest: we miss out on opportunities: we don’t know what we are capable of.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are too ambitious: we don’t know what we shouldn’t attempt. We lack a clear sense of our limitations, wasting years trying to do something we’re not suited to.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t grasp the ways in which we are difficult employees or bosses. We might &#8211; among other problems &#8211; be crazily defensive, or resistant to trusting anyone or too eager to please.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t perceive our hidden attitudes to success and failure. It may be that we see ourselves (wrongly) as not cut out for the bigger roles or when things start to go well, we become manically prone to make a blunder. Perhaps we’re unconsciously trying to avoid rivalry with a parent, or a sibling by tripping ourselves up. Family dynamics have an enormous, subterranean influence on how effectively we operate at work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIVING WITH OTHERS</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without self-knowledge, we are, in general, a liability to be around:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t realise the effect we tend to have on other people: without at all meaning to, we might come across as arrogant or cold, or as tending to hog attention or as needlessly shy and hesitant or as getting furious in dangerous ways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may fall prey to unnecessary loneliness: not understanding what we really need and what makes us hard to get to know.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulties of empathy: not acknowledging the more vulnerable or disturbed parts of oneself; means not seeing oneself as being ‘like’ other people in crucial ways. It’s hard to understand the deeper bits of others without having explored oneself first.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6252253136_8896c836f1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9920" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6252253136_8896c836f1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6252253136_8896c836f1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SPENDING MONEY UNWISELY </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of what we spend money on is a hunch about what will make us happy. But without self-knowledge, we’ll have a hard time figuring out the relationship between what we purchase and how we feel.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holidays and travels will leave us disappointed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impulsive purchases will soon be regretted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll be prey to fashion: not knowing ourselves, we’ll be at the mercy of what consumer society tells us to want.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We might become inadvertent snobs: liking things because others like them rather than for deeper personal reasons.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Self-knowledge has always been important. But now it’s more so than ever. This is a result of political and social progress. When life was much more constrained by tradition, rigid social hierarchy and rigorous codes of manners, there was less need for self-knowledge to guide action. Now, if we are to exploit the independence and freedom we’ve been offered (in love, work and social lives), there is all the more reason to get to know ourselves in good time.</p>
<p><b>TWO: WHY IS SELF-KNOWLEDGE SO HARD TO COME BY?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pay a high price for lack of self-knowledge. So why is it in short supply? Why is it hard for us to know ourselves in these ways? It’s not laziness or stupidity that explains it. There are several huge cognitive frailties that make it hard for us to have certain kinds of insight about ourselves. There are six reasons why self-knowledge is tricky for creatures with the kinds of minds we have.</span></p>
<p><strong>One: The Unconscious</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human beings have evolved into creatures whose minds are divided into conscious and unconscious processes. Digesting lunch is unconscious; reflecting on what you’d like to do this weekend is conscious.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12120008_430a33f548_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9923" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12120008_430a33f548_o.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="12120008_430a33f548_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for this division is bandwidth. We simply couldn’t cope if everything we did had to be filtered through the conscious mind.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, we start off as children with fierce difficulties around self-awareness. Nature has structured us so that self-awareness comes very late on: you only have to study how children are to know that an awareness of self is a very late evolution of character.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4641589419_3d5c41d860_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9927" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4641589419_3d5c41d860_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4641589419_3d5c41d860_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, we can argue that we suffer because a little too much of how we behave happens unconsciously &#8211; when we would benefit from a closer grasp on what was going on. The default balance between conscious and unconscious tends to be wrong, we are incentivised to let too much of who we are happen in the unconscious.</span></p>
<p>As a general point, we need to make heroic efforts to correct the imbalance and bring more of our lives into the conscious realm.</p>
<p><strong>Two: The Emotional and the Rational Mind</strong></p>
<p>A traditional way of conceiving of our minds is that there’s a small rational bit and a far larger, more dominant emotional bit.</p>
<p>Plato compared the rational bit to a group of wild horses dragging the conscious mind along.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20845692109_a7965fc16c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9929" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20845692109_a7965fc16c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="20845692109_a7965fc16c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays, neuroscientists tell us about three parts of the brain:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the reptilian</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the limbic </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- and the neocortex</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reptilian is, as the name sounds, the earliest and the most primitive. It’s interested in basic survival and responds immediately, in knee-jerk ways, unconsciously and rather aggressively and destructively. It’s what’s engaged if a lion surprises you in the jungle.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6947070424_36a7375aa8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9931" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6947070424_36a7375aa8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="6947070424_36a7375aa8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The limbic part of the brain, a later development is concerned with emotions and memories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The neocortex, a very late development, is where our higher reasoning faculties lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t have to buy into the precise terminology here to understand the drift: a lot of our lives is dominated by automatic, over-emotional, distorting responses by the ‘lower’ parts of the mind; and only occasionally can we hope to gain rational perspective through our higher faculties.</span></p>
<p><strong>Three: Freudian Resistance</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it isn’t just the case that things are unconscious by accident. It was Sigmund Freud’s great insight that they remain unconscious because of a squeamishness on our part: there is &#8211; in his term &#8211; extraordinary ‘resistance’ to making a lot of our unconscious material conscious.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unconscious contains desires and feelings that deeply challenge a more comfortable vision of ourselves. We might discover &#8211; if we got to know ourselves better &#8211; that we’re attracted to a different gender, or have career ambitions quite different from those our society expects of us. We therefore ‘resist’ finding out too much about ourselves in many areas. It shatters the short-term peace we’re addicted to.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4164759025_da547a9341_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9933" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4164759025_da547a9341_z.jpg?resize=635%2C442" alt="4164759025_da547a9341_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, of course, for Freud, we pay a high price for this. Short-term peace is unstable, it is, to use another word of his, ‘neurotic’, and cuts us off from the benefits of long-term honesty about aspects of our identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Too often we say of thoughts, it’s ‘safer not to go there’. One simply pushes feelings and ideas aside. Resistance means we are escaping the humiliation of admitting to particular appetites and desires &#8211; especially when these are at odds with what we’d like to be like or how others want us to be. We reduce our immediate suffering. But the cost is that we can’t properly aim for what would truly make us happy.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: Other people won’t tell us</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many aspects of our identities that it is simply hard for us to see without the help of another person. We need others to be our mirrors, feeding back their insights and perspectives on the elusive, hard-to-see parts of ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, getting hold of data from others is a very unreliable process. Very few people can be bothered to undertake the arduous task of giving us feedback.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5532251255_e655e70829_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9937" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5532251255_e655e70829_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C512" alt="5532251255_e655e70829_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either they dislike us too much and therefore can’t be bothered. Or they like us too much, and don’t want to upset us.</span></p>
<p>Our friends are too polite; good intentions lead them to keep their less pleasant observations to themselves. Our enemies have so much to tell us: it’s not always the people we like who see certain aspects of us most clearly. It might be someone we’re at loggerheads with who has the sharpest sense of what’s not quite going right in our character (a way, for instance, of letting people down after a long period of seeming to go along with their plans; a very annoying habit of sitting on the fence). But they are not likely to be good at sharing their wisdom with us. They either won’t take the trouble, or will brush us off with the sort of sharp insults that will make us defensive and closed to the wiser aspects embedded within their harsh assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Five: We haven’t lived enough</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many bits of self-knowledge only come through experience. Think of ourselves as being like a biscuit mould: it’s only by pressing ourselves against the dough of life that we get to see what shape we actually are.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8041914781_d2deb1560b_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9939" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8041914781_d2deb1560b_b.jpg?resize=635%2C572" alt="8041914781_d2deb1560b_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge therefore isn’t something we can always do in isolation, retreating from the world to look into ourselves.</span></p>
<p>We acquire knowledge dynamically, by trying things out and colliding with others &#8211; which always carries a risk, and takes time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In careers, for example, we can’t know what we might want to do with our lives simply by asking ourselves this question. We need to head out into the workplace and try things out. We need to spend a week at an architect’s office, or go and meet someone in the diplomatic service etc.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5015628145_70684eaae0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9942" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5015628145_70684eaae0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="5015628145_70684eaae0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge can only evolved as a result of dialogue with the world.</span></p>
<p><strong>Six: We are fatefully vague about stuff</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our thoughts about many things are marked first and foremost by vagueness. Our intellectual muscles are &#8211; by nature &#8211; rather weak. Our initial reactions to things are frequently of the order of ‘yum’ or ‘yuk’. We have pronounced pro or contra feelings towards something but struggle to say more. We say things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to be creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I loathe big business</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m feeling out of sorts</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">He annoys me</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These reports might be true, but they are not very high-quality items in terms of self- knowledge. They’re not accurate enough to help guide action. It’s not that they are wrong, the problem is they are too vague. They don’t get to grips with what is really the issue. They circle in the big, general territory but don’t land anywhere specific.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t a personal problem. It’s universal. The first reports from our conscious minds are just by nature horribly vague &#8211; and in need of sustained analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Seven: Introspection is low on prestige and unfamiliar</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Introspection is the name we give to the close study of one’s feelings and ideas.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17444642555_fa91a08408_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9944" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/17444642555_fa91a08408_z.jpg?resize=635%2C385" alt="17444642555_fa91a08408_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, it isn’t given high prestige in our society. We’re rarely encouraged to unpack our thoughts. The notion of what it means to have a conversation with a friend rarely includes trying to make progress in sorting out feelings. Psychotherapy &#8211; the prime arena for analysing oneself &#8211; interests barely 1% of the population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of increasing the self-knowledge of a society is to help make the idea of introspection a little more glamorous; it should be thought of as a very plausible concept to spend a weekend on or host a dinner party around.</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: HOW TO GET MORE SELF-KNOWLEDGE &#8211; AND IN WHAT AREAS</b></p>
<p><b>ONE: &#8211; RELATIONSHIPS</b></p>
<p><b>i: Repetition Compulsion</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not terribly flexible when it comes to falling in love. We have types. There are patterns: each of us tends to have a characteristic sort of person we go for &#8211; a more or less sketchy template of the sort of person we find very attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The template is highly individual, but if we could open up people’s heads we might find things like:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the <em>B</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">yronic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> type &#8211; dark hair (frequently tousled), reserved but intense; naughty</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9948" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5999173176_e863594e0d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">serene type &#8211; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">calm, unruffled, angst-free</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9946" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C318" alt="6472122961_c6477930d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cheeky</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> type &#8211; bouncy, unpretentious, free  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9949" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5991451389_05c65484eb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We’re used to seeing our types in terms of the positives. But, in fact, every type also carries a lot of negatives as well. The people we tend to go for may be attractive to us not only for some very nice reasons but also because they bring with them some special kind of trouble or difficulty to which we are especially prone. Most of us are involved in the compulsion to repeat kinds of suffering in our personal lives, normally based on a suffering in early childhood.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Putting the same templates in darker terms, it might turn out that someone is drawn to:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9948" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5999173176_e863594e0d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5999173176_e863594e0d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a chaotic, selfish, volcanic person who seems always to be on the verge of losing their temper and is never on time (Byronic)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9946" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6472122961_c6477930d1_z.jpg?resize=635%2C318" alt="6472122961_c6477930d1_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone who will be wrapped up in themselves and slightly depressed (serene)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9949" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5991451389_05c65484eb_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5991451389_05c65484eb_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an infantile person with poor self-management skills who needs a lot of looking after (cheeky)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We need self-knowledge in love because were so prone to repeat unhealthy patterns. We leave a relationship hoping to leave behind a particular set of problems &#8211; which we find again in the next relationship. These patterns normally derive from childhood experience whereby love was mixed in with various kinds of suffering. The father whose attention and affection we craved was also often annoyed (annoyance, ever since, has proved desperately interesting to a part of us); the mother who we loved was often preoccupied and always heading out to do more exciting things while leaving us behind (our partner is in a high stress job and doesn’t often call&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now when we’re searching for affection and closeness we look out for some quite negative, even damaging things, since we have learned to think that this is how love works. We don’t notice it, so the pattern keeps on guiding our behaviour in unfortunate ways. The psychoanalytic theory of </span><b>repetition compulsion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> means that you’re also being drawn to something problematic. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are rather bossy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are critical</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are in some way rather inadequate and in need of help</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">they are agitated and irritable</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means first of all </span><b><i>seeing</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the pattern. It means understanding the negative aspects of the type of person we tend to get involved with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culturally we are resistant to this kind of self-knowledge. We’re not used to the notion that we might be drawn to people for bad reasons. We want to say: I hate it when people don’t listen or I really don’t like irritable and agitated individuals. And of course that is true. We don’t like it when people behave these ways.</span></p>
<p><b>But we do much too often end up with them!</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>– Think of a celebrity or actor that you find attractive.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6998770173_1ec427ce93_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9953" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6998770173_1ec427ce93_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="6998770173_1ec427ce93_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are some good things you find attractive about them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What might be the bad reasons you are drawn to them? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are the difficult sides of people you’re oddly rather drawn to? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Sketch a ‘type’ you find attractive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What are the bad reasons you find this type attractive? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What have the consequences been in your life?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Gaining self-knowledge about the darker aspects of one’s own pattern of attraction allows us to be more strategic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking for a new relationship:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Realise that emotional appeal is not necessarily &#8211; for us &#8211; the best guide to who we could have good relationship with.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pick up at a much earlier stage that one might be making this mistake and recognising that it is a mistake.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6946571627_eab30ba24a_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9955" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6946571627_eab30ba24a_k.jpg?resize=635%2C341" alt="6946571627_eab30ba24a_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a long-standing relationship: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accept that we shouldn’t simply blame the other person for certain annoying characteristics &#8211; such as their distance or irritability. We can admit that this was part of what drew us to them in the first place.   </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It helps identify the kind of compensating maturity one needs; if you are drawn to quite critical people, you can’t always then blame them for being critical.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ii: PROJECTION </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our minds have a strong natural tendency to PROJECTION, that is, to elaborate a response to a current situation from incomplete hints &#8211; drawing upon a dynamic set up in our past and indicative of our unconscious interests, drives and concerns.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at this image, which appears as part of a famous PROJECTION TEST:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Projection-Image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9957" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Projection-Image.jpg?resize=550%2C650" alt="Projection-Image" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>If you ask, what’s going on here, we all could read different things into the image. People might say something like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a father and son, mourning together for a shared loss, maybe they’ve heard that a friend of the family has died. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a manager in the process of sacking (more in sorrow than in anger) a very unsatisfactory young employee.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I feel something obscene is going on out of the frame: it’s in a public urinal, the older man is looking at the younger guy’s penis and making him feel very embarrassed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thing we do know &#8211; really &#8211; is that the picture doesn’t really show any of these things. It is an AMBIGUOUS image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The picture simply shows two men rather formally dressed, one slightly older. </span><b>The elaboration is coming from the person who looks at it.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And the way they elaborate, the kind of story they tell, may say more about them than it does about the image. Especially if they get insistent and very sure that this is what the picture really means. </span><b>This is projection.</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don’t just do this around images; the same thing happens with people. In relationships, projection kicks in when there are ‘ambiguous situations’.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, your partner is quietly chuckling at a text message. They don’t offer to share it with you. They quickly send a reply. You start to feel very agitated. It looks like your partner is having an affair. They have just received a message from their lover reminding them of some very intimate joke (which might even be about you and your failings); you partner eagerly responds. They don’t love you. You are abandoned, betrayed. You are now very angry with you partner; you feel victimised. But actually, nothing like this is really going on at all. The message was from an over-conscientious colleague at work, and your partner found it comic they should be bothering about such trivia and didn’t think it was even worth mentioning. In fact, the distress you felt derived from when you were at school: you discovered that the person you thought was your best friend was actually saying mean things about to others. You are still wounded by this, though you hate to admit it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3158139232_68f84029ec_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9962" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3158139232_68f84029ec_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3158139232_68f84029ec_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The structure is </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We observe something but in honest truth it’s not entirely clear what it means. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We read into the situation a set of motive, intentions, attitudes &#8211; which are usually distressing to us and give rise to anxiety and anger.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The anxiety or fear actually relate to an earlier experience. But we don’t realise this. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are frightened by, or angry about, what’s happening now. Even though really we shouldn’t be.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projection is always about telling ourselves a story in answer to the question: what did</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">really mean? That might be, for instance, be a situation as well as a person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we are projecting it doesn’t FEEL as if we are doing anything complicated or special. On the contrary it feels just as if we are seeing things as they are. So, typically we dislike the suggestion that we are ‘projecting’. It feels as if it is an insult to our ability to perceive how things really are. Admitting the possibility that one might be projecting is humbling. But it could be worth it because projection brings a lot of trouble into our lives. We’re venting our anger on the wrong individual. And maybe in the process hurting someone very unfairly. We are afraid of the wrong person. Our fear of someone in the past gets in the way of making a friend or ally of someone today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means recognising one’s projections and attempting to repatriate. The active issue isn’t here and now: it’s some unfinished business from the past that’s still bugging us. </span></p>
<p><b>EXERCISE </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– In the images below what do you think is going on? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Say (without thinking too much) what you believe is happening. Write it down on a piece of paper, while others do the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then, as a class, go around and compare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then ask yourselves what your possible explanation says not about the picture &#8211; it’s ambiguous &#8211; but about you. What parts of you have ‘projected’ into the ambiguous image?</span></p>

<p><b>TWO: &#8211; CONFRONTATION AND CRITICISM</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area where a lack of self-knowledge bites is around how we characteristically behave with others, friends, family and colleagues. There are a number of themes here.</span></p>
<p><strong>i: Confrontation Styles </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daily life offers us constant frustrations where we have a choice as to how we might respond. All of us exhibit a variety of ‘confrontation styles’, but we’re often unaware which kind we generally go in for &#8211; and what the costs and consequences are.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Someone promised you a document by midday. It’s now 1pm. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- It’s your birthday next week, but your partner hasn’t said anything about it. You’d ideally love to go out.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9965" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z.jpg?resize=635%2C406" alt="9724845490_02e74c4cb4_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- There’s a drilling sound coming from next door &#8211; again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-  A work colleague has been muscling in on one of your clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do you feel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how would you typically react?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are 4 key varieties of possible responses: passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive or assertive:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Passive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you feel it’s just how life goes, some things you have to accept; if you make a fuss, it just makes everything worse. After all, it’s not that bad really. Sometimes you really resent these things, but you make yourself put up with them.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Aggressive:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m bloody annoyed. Where is that document? Why hasn’t my partner mentioned a party? Why should I suffer because the neighbours are incompetent, stupid, greedy or too lazy to do their DIY at some reasonable hour? If they don’t get their act together you’re really going to show them who’s boss. They can shape up or ship out as far as you are concerned.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Passive-aggressive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A curious toxic mixture of passivity and more aggressive feelings. One tells oneself things like: ‘I don’t make a big fuss about my birthday &#8211; and of course my partner has a lot on their plate always.’ But secretly one is fuming. Or one thinks, ‘X is a perennially unreliable fool,’ but when their document eventually comes in at 5pm, one says, ‘Great to get this!!’ and leaves it at that… There’s a lot of hostility around but it is indirect. The passive aggressive person keeps their anger veiled just enough so as to be able to deny it to others and to themselves. They don’t feel they are being negative or aggressive. They see themselves as hard done by. What they hate most of all is to make a fuss &#8211; but that doesn’t prevent them being very upset. Often, the upset which hasn’t emerged with the person who caused it will later find a way out with a more innocent party. Passive aggressive people who didn’t make their feelings clear in the office will, when they get home, frequently take it out on the kids, the partner or the dog. Passive-aggression has its roots in low self-esteem. One simply doesn’t feel one is allowed to make a direct critique. Direct criticism takes confidence. At the same time, one can’t be happy either. Therefore, the compromise is a veiled compromise attack.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Assertive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: you are clear about when someone has behaved badly towards you or is causing a problem. You aren’t happy about it. But your main aim is to fix the problem. You don’t need to take revenge or try to get the other person to feel guilty. You can go up to them and confidently make your point. You aren’t ashamed of yourself or guilty for making a fuss. You think it’s normal to treat people well &#8211; you do &#8211; and if someone else falls below your standards, you’re not embarrassed to tell them so in plain terms. It won’t be a catastrophe, just a few unpleasant moments, but that will allow the relationship to improve over the long-term. No festering wounds here.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very few of us are assertive. One estimate is that no more than 20% of the population manage to be direct in a mature way about their ailments. That means there’s a lot of subterranean anger, a lot of people who are being shouted at even though they aren’t really responsible.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/587483238_3ed5b750e9_b.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9967" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/587483238_3ed5b750e9_b.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="587483238_3ed5b750e9_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason why passive-aggression is something we’re not aware of doing &#8211; and therefore need to increase our self-knowledge around &#8211; is that there are lots of inhibitions to being ‘straight’ around things one’s annoyed about:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might feel one doesn’t deserve to make a fuss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might have a sense of shame/inner conviction of being bad which prevents one from taking the high ground ever, even when one deserves to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- one might feel that other people will respond volcanically and catastrophically if one makes any complaint against them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These assumptions are all worth questioning.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is from something called the Ascendance-Submission study by the American psychologist Gordon Allport:</span></p>
<p>1. Someone tries to push ahead of you in line. You have been waiting for some time, and can&#8217;t wait much longer. Suppose the intruder is the same sex as yourself, do you usually:</p>
<p>– remonstrate with the intrude</p>
<p>– &#8216;look daggers&#8217; at the intruder or make clearly audible comments to your neighbour</p>
<p>– decide not to wait and go away</p>
<p>– do nothing</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9974" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z.jpg?resize=635%2C346" alt="18299824758_1bcb26d62c_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>2. Do you feel self-conscious in the presence of superiors in the academic or business world?</p>
<p>– markedly</p>
<p>– somewhat</p>
<p>– not at all</p>
<p>3. Some possession of yours is being worked upon at a repair shop. You call for it at the time appointed, but the repair man informs you that he has &#8220;only just begun to work on it.&#8221; Is your customary reaction:</p>
<p>– to upbraid him</p>
<p>– to express dissatisfaction mildly</p>
<p>– to smother your feelings entirely</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another American psychologist, Dr Saul Rosenzweig, came up with the Picture Frustration test, which shows a number of frustrating situations and invites us to fill in the blanks:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9969" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500.png?resize=454%2C579" alt="tumblr_l4vvx12fmI1qzfduso1_500" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might you respond to this scenario? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try this out + discuss what other moments in life you respond in similar ways&#8230;</span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Criticism</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Criticism is always challenging,  but people respond to it in a variety ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be hugely beneficial to get a better grip on your characteristic response/behaviour around criticism &#8211; in order to be able to modulate it, and advance towards the more mature varieties.</span></p>
<p><strong>Possible Responses to Criticism</strong></p>
<p>1. They must be entirely wrong:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the response colloquially known as ‘defensive’ &#8211; whereby a criticism unleashes a disproportionately strong defence against it. The original criticism isn’t heard, for its destinee is so taken up with shoring up their position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One thinks: &#8220;I am OK, I don’t generally make mistakes. If they are annoyed with me, it’s likely that they are being too demanding, or they’re jealous, or they’re trying to kick me down. The problem is theirs.&#8221;</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p>2. They must be entirely right and I don’t deserve to exist:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here one thinks that a local criticism (of a book, a document, something one said over dinner) is in fact pointing to a global problem. Very quickly, the local criticism brings about a crisis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t deserve to exist. I am a wretch. They have seen through the facade. It is true, I am meaningless, petty, stupid and dull&#8230;’</span></p>
<p>3. They might be right AND I can be OK</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here one is able to contain the criticism to the issue at hand. One is able to distinguish between a criticism of some aspect of oneself and a wholehearted assault on one’s identity. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15836610049_033b782406_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9977" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15836610049_033b782406_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15836610049_033b782406_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>One of the most popular forms of self-knowledge exercises among psychologists involve an invitation to finish sentence stubs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea is to answer fast, without thinking too much, thereby allowing the unconscious mind to have its say before it is censored.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some sentence stubs to complete around the issue of criticism:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When someone points out a piece of work of mine is less than perfect, I…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- When my boss says something to me, I think…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- Bosses who criticise typically&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try to work out your Criticism style:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– are you defensive</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– or do you feel globally attacked</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– or locally attacked?</span></p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One’s response to criticism is formed in childhood.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the task of all parents to criticise their children and break bad news to them about their wishes and plans &#8211; but there are evidently different ways of going about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The best sort of criticism leaves a child feeling that the criticism is local &#8211; but that they remain loved and adored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the suggestion is that everyone makes mistakes, especially the parents, and that criticism is a well-meaning and in no way threatening aspect of daily life.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5308268074_0936a164b2_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9980" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5308268074_0936a164b2_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="5308268074_0936a164b2_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are also scenarios where the child is criticised and no one notices that the criticism cuts too deep. There is no suggestion that this is ONLY a limited criticism. The child falls prey to the belief that they are entirely worthless. Throughout adulthood, the slightest critique can re-evoke this perspective.</span></p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did you learn about criticism in your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did your mother/father make you feel when they criticised you?</span></p>
<p><b>THREE: &#8211; CAREER</b></p>
<p><strong>i: Vagueness around one’s ambitions</strong></p>
<p>When thinking about aspirations, hopes and what it would be good to do, there’s a very strong tendency to end up saying things like:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to help other people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to be creative</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I want to do something that matters</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22568358497_7e0de42273_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9983" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/22568358497_7e0de42273_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="22568358497_7e0de42273_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The statements might be very true and the sentiments admirable. The problem with them is that they are vague. They don’t point in any particular direction: they don’t guide action or do much to help make a decision. Vagueness is a sign of the difficulty we have around self-knowledge. It shows that in some important aspect of life we don’t yet know ourselves very well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we improve self-knowledge around ambitions? </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>1. Dare to name some people you envy and or admire &#8211; however grand and implausible. One of the causes of vagueness is that (after the age of about eleven) we feel embarrassed to mention very high status individuals as inspiration; we sense that we’ll be seen as pretentious or naive. But it’s important to list them because they are the grandest version of the person you want to be. It could be Michelangelo or Lady Gaga or Goethe or Bill Gates. The point isn’t that you necessarily want to be them or just like them. It’s that there is something about them that you want to learn from.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9985" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="8798894510_9b0f93c18d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>2. Moving from person to trait. Analyse what it is about them that you admire…</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It needn’t be the thing they are most famous for. The cause of vagueness here is that we get hung up on people. We focus on the person &#8211; and there are so many different things about them that are impressive. So simply naming them leaves it vague what it is we’re trying to learn from this person’s example. </span></p>
<p>3. How could that quality be more present in your life…</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another cause of vagueness is inflexibility. We can see how that quality played itself out in that person’s life. But what we really want to know is what else can be done with it. The person we’re thinking about is only giving a hint.  </span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Attitudes to ambition</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many </span><b>obstacles to doing well at work</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, getting the kind of partner we feel we deserve; or getting on top of our financial and creative lives: competition from able rivals, not enough room at the top, prejudice, limited talents. But some of the most serious barriers to success come from within our own heads. We suffer from problematic attitudes to success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are held back by anxiety around success. These anxieties mean that we are not purely seeking to succeed. Without realising it, we are also quite invested in aspects of failure.  </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Success makes you envied. They’ll think I’m showing off, big-noting myself. I really don’t want to be the target of other people’s envy. Better to remain on the sidelines. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inner feudalism: there are sorts of people who are allowed to succeed and do big things in the world; unfortunately, I’m not one of them; things like that just don’t happen to people like me.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3240991428_4691b3a4bc_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9987" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3240991428_4691b3a4bc_o.jpg?resize=635%2C373" alt="cyberuly@yahoo.it" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the danger of over-investment in the idea of ‘success’. It’s natural to want to do well-enough around work. But career can be a magnet for other hopes that don’t really belong in this area. One comes to believe that if only things go well in terms of career or money, many other problems will be solved too. It’s a line of thought that is strongly encouraged by contemporary society. Meritocratic attitudes invite the misleading thought that how you do at work is a measure of your global worth; advertising relentlessly projects the thought that psychological qualities like friendship, good relationships, serenity and a sense of fun are tied to financial prosperity (and hence to career success). These kinds of thoughts are not explicitly running through our heads but reflection on our behaviour may indicate that we act as if we believe such things as: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I succeed at work, I will deserve to be loved. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will stop feeling lonely when I’ve made it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The holiday will be great &#8211; if only we stay in luxury.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High status means happiness.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15037815133_5a787fca61_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9990" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15037815133_5a787fca61_z.jpg?resize=635%2C507" alt="15037815133_5a787fca61_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once such beliefs have been made explicit they can be put to the test. For instance: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">other people can succeed, but not me.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is it true? Examine it like a statement in court. What evidence supports this? What are all the things that could be said in its favour and assess their plausibility.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some people are born lucky &#8211; this can’t be right.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">talent is unequally distributed &#8211; true, but many of the people who you think are successful are not more talented than you.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">there are prejudices which favour some and disadvantage others &#8211; yes, but (usually) only to some extent, they are not decisive</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– If I succeed, what will happen is… (both negative and positive)  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– By succeeding, I’d love to please…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– The person who might (secretly) be most dismayed by my success would be…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– People who are successful are typically…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– I wouldn’t want to be a success because..</span></p>
<p><strong>iii: The meaning of your life</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the middle of daily life, impressed by the expectations of other people and bombarded with ideas from the media and advertising (which are unlikely to have one’s own best interest at heart), it’s completely unsurprising that we get confused about how much something really matters to us. </span></p>
<p><b>EXERCISE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you were on your deathbed, what would you regret not doing…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exercise is designed to tease out underlying ambitions that you are reluctant to explore. They might seem too challenging or embarrassing to admit to anyone else. The point isn’t necessarily to explain them to others but to give them more attention in the privacy of your own head. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why, in fact, do you hold back from doing these things?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How might those obstacles be addressed?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What specific practical steps you could take?</span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The death-bed exercise also helps reveal the true hierarchy of our needs.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things that have only a very limited contribution to make to our flourishing come to seem much more important than the really are.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We underrate the importance of things that are familiar or maybe not especially exciting.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>FOUR: &#8211; </b><b>WHAT OTHERS CAN KNOW OF US (AT ONCE)</b></p>
<p>When it comes to other people, we are all a bit like mind-readers. Mind-readers astonish their customers by telling them things about their lives &#8211; you have had a quarrel with your parents recently; you were close to a sibling when you were a child, but in recent years you have drifted apart and that makes you sad. And the visitor is left wondering: how did they know this about me. It must be magic. They can sometimes tell us after a minute things that it’s taken us years to find out about ourselves. They might note that we react defensively when mentioning our parents &#8211; as if we feel we are about to be accused of something; though this characteristic is one we are reluctant to recognise in ourselves. Mind-reading just shows up that knowledge about us is surprisingly obvious and easy for an outsider to get hold of &#8211; much easier than for us inside. Strangers are surprisingly good at guessing things about us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One consequence is that we find it difficult to grasp how other people see us. The gap between self-perception and the point of view of others is richly comic: pomposity for example occurs when someone can’t see that other people don’t share their high opinion of their own merits; and there’s a satisfaction in seeing this person being forced by events to a much lower and more accurate picture of themselves. But mostly, of course, it doesn’t seem especially funny: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t realise</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that you are taxing other people’s patience</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other people often feel you hog the limelight</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you come across as arrogant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you seem excessively diffident</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">you are often trying to hint that you have done everything anyone else has done; as if it would be painful to you to be impressed by anyone</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2163760529_914e576884_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9998" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2163760529_914e576884_z1.jpg?resize=635%2C459" alt="2163760529_914e576884_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The point isn’t that other people are always right. The point isn’t that one should feel cross with other people for not rightly appreciating one’s better intent. (‘Of course, I didn’t mean to be arrogant? Can’t they tell the difference between honest assertion and showing off?’)  It’s just that it is really helpful to know how we impact on other people since this allows for strategic adjustment. Once we know we can try to change for the sake of getting on better with others &#8211; being a little less assertive at certain points or making an effort to ask other people questions about themselves.</span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pair up with someone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get them to say 5 nice things about this person, based on very little knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, one negative thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did they know this negative thing? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swap roles. </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Write down the kind of animal you might see yourself as being. And list three attributes that you feel you share to some extent with this kind of creature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Then ask another person to draw the animal they see you as being, and to pick out three characteristics that help explain why. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– What do you learn from their choice and their reasons?</span></p>
<p><b>FIVE: &#8211; FAMILY DYNAMICS</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>i: Overall Picture: How you feel about your family</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you really feel about your family? Especially the things that you don’t say for all sorts of reasons: you might hurt particular people; you feel guilty because, after all they have been very good to you in some ways; you feel disloyal; you fear that people will feel sorry for you in ways that make you awkward; you fear that people will regard you with contempt. Such thoughts are likely to remain shadowy. We have unconscious &#8211; or barely unconscious attitudes in relation to family that are liable to play serious havoc with our lives. Possibilities include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attitudes to a younger brother are governing one’s feelings about never having enough.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Feelings about an older sister have led to problems around envy.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A general tendency to be deferential around authority might be traced to an excessive need to please one’s parents.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21756049429_d12330162a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10002" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21756049429_d12330162a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="21756049429_d12330162a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A key psychological exercise is to draw your nuclear family; putting in parents + siblings + house + a sun + a tree.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then examine the drawing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Draw your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask: Who is big?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who is small?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where is everyone standing?</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2068811986_a2d5a76167_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10004" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2068811986_a2d5a76167_z.jpg?resize=635%2C513" alt="2068811986_a2d5a76167_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some typical themes in analysis:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- who you draw yourself next to is who you are closest to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- who are you are most distant from is put faraway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the size you have drawn yourself is the size of your self-esteem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- the house is an extension of yourself: it is the ego. Is it in good shape? Optimistic? Ordered?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Windows imply a degree of communication/passage. Does it have a door?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is only a start, and it’s not science &#8211; but the exercise is useful nevertheless, trying &#8211; like the sentence stubb exercise &#8211; to catch our unconscious slightly unawares in order to reveal its structure.</span></p>
<p><strong>ii: Blame and self-knowledge:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may not be aware of the extent to which we assign problems in our lives to our parents. </span></p>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>1. What do you blame your parents for?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we are looking for an ego response: how they hurt me, the mistakes they made etc.</span></p>
<p>2.<b> </b>Why do you think they were the way they were?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very different sort of question. It asks you to step outside of yourself and ask not, how did they hurt me or disappoint me &#8211; but rather, what were the pressures and difficulties they were under. It interrupts the circuit of hurt-blame, replacing it with hurt-understanding.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4739023417_679e49c25f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10031" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4739023417_679e49c25f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Father Holding Daughter's Hand" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blaming one’s parents isn’t &#8211; of course &#8211; always a mistake. It’s just that doing so can get in the way of a better understanding of the nature of a problem. And hence of what it is possible to do about it.</span></p>
<p><b>SIX: &#8211; TASTE AND YOUR IDEA OF HAPPINESS</b></p>
<p>We aren’t used to the idea that interior decoration can tell us anything very intimate about ourselves. But aesthetic preferences can yield revealing insights. That’s because personal taste reflects other things about us.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may be disturbed by unfortunate associations to certain kinds of objects or environments. At a particular age you might have seen a film in which a character who deeply appealed to you, lived in rather grand classical mansion; ever since then you’ve had quiet &#8211; but quite strong &#8211; positive feelings about such places. Understanding the attraction leads back to the prior question: what it was about that character that you found so appealing? Or it may be that a rather fearsome relative was very critical of mess, which touched off a rebellious opposite in you; you find a bit of clutter and a confusion of colours homely and endearing (which that person definitely was not). Analysing the response helps uncover the further concerns &#8211; the loves, antipathies, hopes and fears &#8211; that helped to shape your taste.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are drawn to things we don’t have enough of. Aesthetic preference is often connected to the pursuit of balance. If we are typically stressed and anxious, we might be very attracted to serene environments. A person who has been assailed too often by boorish people, might be very attracted to things that suggest refinement, order and harmony: the lack of which has been painfully brought home to them.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We find neglected parts of ourselves in objects: in daily life we may give little attention or respect to aspects of our own nature that &#8211; however &#8211; hint at their existence in our tastes. The thrilled response to a grand interior in another wise demure individual suggest a bolder, more ambitious side to them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider these different interiors:</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">minimalist</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which one do you hate?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which one are you drawn to?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The underlying theory is that we are drawn to visual styles which capture what is MISSING in our psyches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, the person attracted to calm-minimalism doesn’t feel calm inside. They feel on the verge of being overwhelmed &#8211; and look to a taste that can CORRECT their inclinations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly with the bohemian style &#8211; this is favoured not by bohemians, but by people deeply frightened of their native impulses towards conformity and rigidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use visual decoration styles to correct/rebalance ourselves.</span></p>
<p><b>SEVEN: &#8211; </b><b>Wisdom and the search for moments of Higher Consciousness</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, self-knowledge is concerned with describing more accurately how one feels. It follows the path of introspection. You try work out what you actually feel when you look at the sky or watch a film or feel bored in a meeting.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21141215321_880450686e_k.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10019" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21141215321_880450686e_k.jpg?resize=635%2C637" alt="21141215321_880450686e_k" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s another side to self-knowledge: becoming more aware of how the self-machine works: of how your mind operates and distorts things. For instance, you learn that eating a lot of chocolate makes you feel a bit queasy afterwards. Eating chocolate doesn’t feel as if it will do that. It’s so delicious you can’t resist another square. But gradually you just learn that this is how your particular machine work: if you put in a lot of chocolate it starts to create problems. Just as we can learn how the body works, we can also learn how the mind works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the major implication of evolutionary theory is that the human brain itself has evolved over a very long period of time. The body, we readily accept, carries many indications of its long, long developmental story. The kind of eyes we have, the way our knees work or how our lungs extract oxygen from the air are not unique to humans. These kinds of organs and joints evolved long before humans were around.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So too with our brains. Hence the usefulness of talking about a ‘</span><b>reptilian’ </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">part of the brain, even though it isn’t absolutely correct scientifically (we don’t literally have the brain of lizard encased within our skulls). We have instincts and response patterns that evolved to suit being chased by predators or needing mate no matter what, that are more suited to existence in the pleistocene era than to life in a modern metropolis (or rural farming community).</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reptilian brain is interested only in survival and responds instinctively and fast. It is out for itself, it has no capacity for empathy or morality. It is deeply and constitutionally selfish.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we also have a more evolved mature brain (scientists call it the </span><b>neocortex</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">) which is able to gain a distance from immediate reptilian demands. It can observe rather than submit to the sexual impulse: it can study, rather than obey, selfish desires etc.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10023" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="4810398735_9c854f4bb7_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The picture of ourselves &#8211; as having a sophisticated mind sitting on top of a primitive one &#8211; is very helpful because it makes sense of some of our troubles and of our potential for addressing them. The primitive brain is very concerned with safety and reproduction. It is impatient. It’s violent in asserting itself. It has no interest in reasons and explanations. It cannot comprehend what an apology is. In some of our worst moments, the primitive brain is doing the work. From its point of view, smashing a glass on the table might be an ideal way of getting someone to agree with you; being insulting, aggressive and boorish might look like a great way of getting to have sex with someone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That we can behave very badly is, therefore, entirely unsurprising. But it means also that such bad behaviour cannot possible be the whole story about us. Having a divided brain &#8211; a reptilian and non-reptilian mind &#8211; means that the task is always to get the higher part of the mind to be more in charge and to take over whenever things get complicated. If we understand this about ourselves than we don’t have to go around thinking that we are totally worthless and awful because we did a genuinely very stupid and pretty nasty thing. The evolutionary story gives a more helpful explanation. You are not thoroughly bad at all. You just have a current problem: </span><b>your modern brain is not as strong as it needs to be &#8211; and your reptilian brain is far too strong.</b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It defines the nature of the task: I need to get my non-reptile brain to be more prominent. And I need to learn to distinguish which of my hopes, fears and desires belong to the reptilian mind &#8211; and which are soundly founded in the higher rationality of the more evolved mind.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1606966927_7e92985360_z1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10024" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1606966927_7e92985360_z1.jpg?resize=631%2C420" alt="1606966927_7e92985360_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we can call </span><b>higher-consciousness</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> occurs as we flex the muscles of our modern brain; and manage to free ourselves from the hold of the reptilian brain, gaining perspective over our immediate impulses and moods.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another kind of language, we’d say we had been able to ‘free ourselves’ from the ego and to survey our lives and the world free of the immediate imperatives of being ourselves.</span></p>
<p><b>There are FIVE key ways this happens.</b></p>
<p><strong>One: Fostering a capacity to observe one’s cruder impulses</strong></p>
<p>Very occasionally, perhaps late at night, when the pressures of the day have receded, we have access to what feel like moments of wisdom &#8211; they usually don’t last very long but for a short period of time we have access to crucial ideas or insights about the way we operate, which is free of the normal subjectivity, defensiveness or self-justification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning &#8211; and for pretty much the whole day &#8211; you are in a rush. At dinner, your partner makes a comment about how you eat too fast or how you tune out when they are talking about their work &#8211; and immediately you get defensive; you insist you don’t do these things, you say they are hypercritical, that they don’t care and are always coldly judging you. You are furious and might slam the door.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12911788265_09662c1d0c_h.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10029" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/12911788265_09662c1d0c_h.jpg?resize=635%2C496" alt="12911788265_09662c1d0c_h" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then lying awake in the middle of the night you have a powerful sense that quite often you move too fast defend yourself whenever your partner says anything a bit critical. You can picture yourself doing it. They start to speak, it’s so familiar, and immediately you are crouching, ready to deflect the blow. And so you don’t really hear what they have to say. You admit &#8211; very, very privately &#8211; that you do quite often stop paying attention when they talk about work; it’s not merely that you have stopped listening to all the ins and outs of life in their office; it’s that you have stopped paying attention to the way they are speaking, to what it means to them and why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, they’ve got a point. But you feel compelled to say they don’t. And truth be told you know you do eat too fast. Yes, it’s annoying to have it pointed out. But you realise that being a bit critical is a way your partner tries to show affection and care; it’s a possessive gesture on their part. You want to say you’re sorry, hug them, do it differently. In the dark it all makes sense.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8186451012_04fe7b325b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10026" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8186451012_04fe7b325b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="8186451012_04fe7b325b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The midnight insight was right. It was a moment of self knowledge. It was a moment of ‘higher consciousness’ when it was possible to stand back from experience and see it more clearly. You felt sufficiently safe and calm to observe your own behaviour without rushing to either condemn or defend it. You became wiser about yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such states of mind are, however, intermittent. Most of the time we have to be very intent on defending our patch, on fighting our cause. We lack the calm to observe our primitive mind in action.</span></p>
<p><strong>Two: Developing a capacity to interpret the behaviour of others, rather than merely react to it automatically</strong><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the time, we respond immediately (and rather powerfully) to the behaviour of others.</span></p>
<p>They honk the horn at us, we get furious and honk back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They say something mean-sounding, we insult them right back.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5122715574_8743ae767f.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10036" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5122715574_8743ae767f.jpg?resize=500%2C337" alt="5122715574_8743ae767f" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The natural instinct is to meet the primitive with the primitive. Our own reptile nature wants to attack their reptile selves and beat them back into their hole.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there is, of course, another option &#8211; one of the great marvels of evolution and civilisation (morality and religion too).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The civilised, higher move is to understand that they are behaving badly </span><b><i>for a reason which they are in no position to tell you about, so under pressure are they from their more primitive minds.</i></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe they have had a hard day. Maybe they are worried about something. Perhaps they have felt squashed and sidelined in their career and now having someone squeeze in in front of them on the road is too much to bear. Instead of simply seeing them as the dangerous enemy, we can recognise that they are</span><b> distressed</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and that their bad behaviour (the impatient horn the swearing behind the windscreen) is a symptom of hurt rather than of ‘evil’.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10032" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8691742996_5053244d52_z-2.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="8691742996_5053244d52_z (2)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s an astonishing gradual evolution to develop the ability to do this &#8211; to explain other people’s behaviour as caused by their distress, rather than simply to see it in terms of how it affects us. There must have been a first time in human history this happened. And in each life there is perhaps a similar awakening. But often it is so hard for this higher consciousness to break through; we are so deeply caught up in our own troubles that we find it almost impossible to be generous in our assessment of why others are causing us trouble:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try out these ideas (they sound foreign); they are examples of higher consciousness:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sales assistant is being curt with your request, perhaps because his relationship is breaking up. It isn’t about you.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the snobbish person at the party is, ultimately, insecure (although they look self-confident and have just ignored you).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the lout who scratches your car is terrified of being exposed as sexually inadequate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the boaster at the bar is convinced that he can never be loved.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5782138278_c0c4433169_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10039" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5782138278_c0c4433169_z.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="5782138278_c0c4433169_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Three: Developing a capacity for universal love</strong></p>
<p>Once we are able to interpret someone’s pain-inducing behaviour as having roots in their own pain, we’re on the threshold of a remarkable steps. It then appears that in truth, no one in this world is ever simply ‘nasty’. They are always hurt &#8211; and this means that the appropriate response to humanity is not fear, cynicism or aggression, but love.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we relinquish our egos, and loosen ourselves from the grip of our primitive defensive and aggressive thought-processes, we are free to consider humanity in a much more benign light. We might even, at an extreme (this might happen only very late at night once in a while), feel that we could love everyone, that no human could be outside the circle of our sympathy.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3870006964_4d20288227_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10043" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3870006964_4d20288227_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="3870006964_4d20288227_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We attain a state reported by certain yogis, christian ascetics and buddhist monks &#8211; wherein we feel that we have loosened ourselves from the self: we are looking at the world as if we were not ourselves, without the usual filter of our interests, passions and needs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the world, at that moment, reveals itself as quite different: a place of suffering and misguided effort, a place full of people striving to be heard and lashing out against others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fitting response is universal sympathy and kindness.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have taken self-knowledge in a new and interesting direction. Being so aware of ourselves that we can remove the ‘lower self’ from the windscreen through which we look at things &#8211; and therefore look at things in a truer and unegoistic way.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10045" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C490" alt="15462528043_17bcfbdb2f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For years you have had to fight your corner: you have had to grab at every opportunity, defend yourself, look out for your interests. You have to feed and clothe yourself, pay the bills, manage your education, deal as best you can with your own moods and demons. You have to assert your rights, justify your actions and your choices. Being alive is all there is. You are understandably obsessed with your own life &#8211; what option do you have?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there are moments when one’s own life feels less precious, or less crucial &#8211; and not in a despairing way. And without the support of any imagined afterlife.  It might be that the fear of not-existing is &#8211; if only for a little while &#8211; less intense. Perhaps looking out over the ocean at dusk or walking in woodland in winter, or listening to a particular piece of music Bach’s double violin concerto, that it would be alright not to exist; one can contemplate a world in which one is no longer present with some tranquility and still feel appreciative of life. In such rare moments of higher consciousness, one’s mortality is less of a burden; one’s interests can be put aside;  you can fuse with transient things: trees, wind, waves breaking on the shore. From that higher point of view, status doesn’t seem important, possession don’t seem to matter, grievances lose their urgency; one is serene. If certain people could encounter you at this point they be amazed at the transformation.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4242313004_536e04d2d9_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10041" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/4242313004_536e04d2d9_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="4242313004_536e04d2d9_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These higher states of consciousness are short lived. We have to accept that. We shouldn’t aspire to make them permanent &#8211; because they don’t sit so well with many of the very important practical tasks that we need to attend to. We don’t need to be always in them. But we do need to make the most of them. We have to harvest them and preserve them so that we can have access to them when we need them most. The problem is that when we are in these higher states of mind we have highly important insights; but we lose access to them when we return to the ordinary conditions of life. And so we don’t get the benefit of the insight that was there in those special moments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past, religions have been very interested in this move. The Christian churches, for instance, cottoned onto the fact that at times we can recognise that we have been unfair and disloyal to others. It’s a huge triumph over the primitive mind which has little time for such possibilities. They established rituals designed to intensify, prolong and deepen these fragile insights. There was, for example, highly charged words of a special prayer, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confiteor:</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I confess to Almighty God and to you my brothers and sister </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that I have sinned through my own fault, in thoughts and in my words, in what </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have done and in what I have failed to do&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that, ideally, on a very regular basis people would have a powerful experience of recognising that they might have been cruel, harsh, thoughtless, greedy or mean. It didn’t necessarily always work, of course, but the idea is highly significant. It’s an attempt to make this kind of experience less random. To give it more power in our lives and to make the best use of it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21413523192_d19249fbc6_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10049" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/21413523192_d19249fbc6_z.jpg?resize=635%2C431" alt="21413523192_d19249fbc6_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ideal, which is obviously separable from Christianity and involves not occult belief, is that the higher parts of the mind should be more reliable and more powerful.</span></p>
<p><strong>Four: Developing a suspicion about your own feelings</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Normally we are used to the idea of gaining self-knowledge by asking ourselves ever more closely: </span><b><i>how do I feel about this?</i></b></p>
<p>The idea is that you know ‘who you really are’, by studying your feelings.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this suggestion here is something different, indeed the opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we advise is a capacity to stand aside from feelings in order to recognise their potentially deceptive nature. It means acknowledging a fundamental distinction between what we might </span><b><i>feel</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about a situation &#8211; and what it might actually </span><b><i>be.</i></b><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heliocentric.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10051" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Heliocentric.jpg?resize=570%2C480" alt="Heliocentric" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The classic example of this historically is when humans learnt for the first time to accept that even though the earth </span><b>feels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> flat, it </span><b>is </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">in fact round. In other words, when humans learnt to be suspicious about their feelings, trusting instead to the data of their rational minds &#8211; overruling feeling for the sake of reason. This has come very very late on in human evolution, and in day-to-day life, most of us operate in a pre-Copernican way, especially as regards our emotional lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One exception though, from which we can learn a lot, is children. When we deal with small children, we rather easily override our reptilian responses and aim for a higher interpretation. We look beyond what seems, and try to picture what is.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a child who is whiny and then goes up to its parent and hits it and says, I hate you.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2537892547_b563e18052_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10053" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2537892547_b563e18052_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="2537892547_b563e18052_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primitive response is to hit back. The more sophisticated one is to ask: what is going on beneath what I can see of the child’s behaviour?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, because it’s 6pm and they haven&#8217;t had a nap and had a bit of a cold, one will quite naturally ascribe the bad mood to these factors. The higher mind will have interpreted the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However wise this might be, we find it hard to perform the exercise on ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We too might be feeling tired and hungry. But we don’t ask ourselves what role this might be playing in our sudden sense that everyone hates us and that our careers are a disaster.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These seem like entirely reasonable conclusions to draw from real facts. But, in reality, they are the outcome of a very tired and hungry mind trying to deal with existence. After a snack and a lie down, our views will be very different.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2285728600_33d397fd36_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10061" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2285728600_33d397fd36_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2285728600_33d397fd36_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, our minds are filled with ideas that seem to be rationally founded but actually are not, that owe much to lower physical processes that are denied or unrecognised.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-knowledge means becoming much better at realising how many of our mental processes (extending to things like our views on politics and our assessments of our careers and our lovers) can be explained by:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- not having drunk enough water</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- not having had enough sleep</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">- lacking something to eat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you haven&#8217;t slept well for a few nights and you&#8217;ve been working too hard, a few not too tactful comments from your partner can leave you considering divorce. It feels as if your relationship is in tatters, that you need to take a life-changing, dramatic and risky step; that the compromises, accommodations and love of the last few years have all been wasted. The problem looks enormous. But actually it isn&#8217;t. All that&#8217;s wrong is that you are tired. It&#8217;s shockingly hard for us to distinguish between a need of the body and a harrowing emotional conflict.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8727887079_23fa242666_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10057" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8727887079_23fa242666_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8727887079_23fa242666_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or it might be that, having skipped breakfast, a tricky work meeting leaves you determined to resign. Things will be tough, certainly, but anything is better than continuing to sell your soul to these mindless fools. The problem looks as if it is huge &#8211; one&#8217;s career has taken a calamitous turn. Yet the real cause may be no more than depleted blood-sugar levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being told that one&#8217;s view of existence is &#8211; at this moment &#8211; not the product of reason but of indigestion or exhaustion, is utterly maddening. Especially when it is true. We want to believe our woes are essentially all high flown &#8211; intellectual, moral and existential &#8211; when they are often no more, but also no less, than a disturbance of the body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should be careful of over-intellectualising. To be happy, we require big things (money, freedom, love), but we need a lot of semi-insultingly little things too (enough sleep, a good diet, a sunny sky). Babies know this well. They&#8217;re usefully unintellectual. They&#8217;re on hand to remind us of some profound truths.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10176739514_18419fff1f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10059" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/10176739514_18419fff1f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="10176739514_18419fff1f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The operative question, then, isn’t always ‘how do I feel?’ Self-knowledge might equally derive from asking: how do I function? What role are emotions playing in my life? And it can lead us, crucially, at times to discount them despite their strength. This is the higher capacity to stand aside from one’s feelings.</span></p>
<p>When you are tired, dehydrated or hungry, stressed or frightened these states of mind alter your perception of reality. The sense become misleading. Other people’s behaviour is liable to look more menacing than it is; we find it harder to grasp their more complex motives. Threats look bigger than they are; sources of security or pleasure look smaller, more fragile and more distant than in truth they are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The higher position is to recognise that this is a way the self functions. This is what tiredness, dehydration and such states do to us. So we know to be suspicious of certain states of mind, we have to learn not to act on them. Wisdom means getting better at asking: is this reality or might I be seeing things in a distorted way, due to a lack of lunch or 2 hours less sleep.</p>
<p><b>PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATION: ORDERING OUR MINDS RATHER THAN EMPTYING THEM</b></p>
<p>Even though our minds ostensibly belong to us, we don’t always control or know what is in them. There are always some ideas, bang in the middle of consciousness, that are thoroughly and immediately clear to us: for example, that we love our children. Or that we have to be out of the house by 7.40am. Or, that we are keen to have something salty to eat right now. These thoughts feel obvious without burdening us with uncertainty or any requirement that we reflect harder on them.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a host of other ideas tend to hover in a far more unfocused state. For example, we may know that our career needs to change, but it’s hard to say much more. Or we feel some resentment against our partner over an upsetting incident the night before, but we can’t pin down with any accuracy what we’re in fact bitter or sad about. Our confusions sometimes have a positive character about them but are perplexing all the same: perhaps there was something deeply ‘exciting’ about a canal-side cafe we discovered in Amsterdam or the sight of a person reading on a train or the way the sun lit up the sky in the evening after the storm, but it may be equally hard to put a finger on the meaning of these feelings.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10063" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="2273707836_81d67f2c2b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfocused thoughts are constantly orbiting our minds, but from where we are, from the observatory of our conscious selves (as it were), we can’t grasp them distinctly. We speak of needing to ‘sort our heads out’ or to ‘get on top of things’, but quite how one does something like this isn’t obvious – or very much discussed. There is one response to dealing with our minds that has become immensely popular in the West in recent years. Drawn from the traditions of Buddhism, the practice of meditation has gripped the Western imagination, presenting itself as a solution to the problems of our chaotic minds. It is estimated that 1 in 10 adults in the US has taken part in some form of structured meditation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adherents of meditation suggest that we sit very quietly, in a particular bodily position, and strive, through a variety of exercises, to empty our minds of content, quite literally to push or draw away the disturbing and unfocused objects of consciousness to the periphery of our minds, leaving a central space empty and serene. In the Buddhist world-view, anxieties and excitements are not trying to tell us anything especially interesting or valuable. We continuously fret without good purpose, about this or that random and vain thing – and therefore the best solution is simply to push the objects of the mind to one side.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11752252314_204952945b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10065" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/11752252314_204952945b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="11752252314_204952945b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buddhist meditation has been so successful, we are liable to forget another effective and in some ways superior path to finding peace of mind, this one rooted in the Western tradition: Philosophical Meditation. Like its Eastern counterpart, Philosophical Meditation wants our thoughts, feelings and anxieties to trouble us less, but it seeks to sort out our minds in a very different manner. At heart, it doesn’t believe that the contents of our minds are nonsensical or meaningless. Our worries may seem like a nuisance but they are in fact neurotically garbled but important signals about how we should direct our lives. They contain complex clues as to our development. Therefore, rather than wanting simply to empty our minds of content, practitioners of Philosophical Meditation encourage us to clean these minds up: they want to bring the content that troubles us more securely into focus, and thereby usher in calm through understanding rather than through evacuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does one bring the confused objects of the mind into focus? There are instructions for Philosophical Meditation, just as there are for Buddhist Meditation (a little artificiality in these matters may just be what we need to lend the process discipline). The first priority is to set aside a bit of time, ideally 20 minutes, once a day. One should sit with a pad of paper and start by asking oneself a very simple set of questions: what is it that I am regretful, anxious or excited about at present? One is invited to download the immediate contents of one’s mind. One will by nature be a little unsure of what our feelings mean, so it is best simply to write down – without thinking or censoring ourselves – one or two words around each feeling. It’s a case of tipping out the contents of the mind onto the paper as unselfconsciously as possible. One might, for example, write down: Darren, Cologne trip, weekend, shoes, Mum, face at train station… The task is then to try to convert each of these words from an ambiguous and silent worry, regret or thrill into something one can understand, grasp, order and eventually better control. Success in this meditation relies on a skilful process of questioning. Imagine these thoughts as ineloquent and muddled strangers, who are full of valuable ideas, but whom one has to get to know in a roundabout way, by directing just the right questions at them.

<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2757337391_f0de45b060_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10068" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2757337391_f0de45b060_z.jpg?resize=635%2C554" alt="2757337391_f0de45b060_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Philosophical Meditation brings us calm not by removing issues, but by helping us to understand them, thereby evaporating some of the paranoia and static that might otherwise cling to them. When confused objects of consciousness become clearer, they stop bothering us quite so much. Problems don’t disappear, but they assume proportion and can be managed. For example, we may make ourselves at home with an array of administrative worries that had been clumsily concealed under the vague title of ‘the Cologne trip’. The word ‘Darren’ might disclose someone we envy, but who holds out a fascinating run of clues as to how we might make a new move in our career. The word ‘weekend’ yields feelings towards one’s partner which are both resentful and yet capable of being discussed and perhaps worked through in the evening. Sorting out our minds doesn’t just feel comforting (like tidying our homes), it also spares us grave errors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused excitement can be highly dangerous when it involves career ambitions. Imagine someone with a tendency to experience excitement when reading <em>Vogue</em> or <em>Gourmet Traveller</em> – and who then declares, without much attempt to analyse the feeling, that they want ‘to work in magazines’. It may seem reasonable enough for them to send off a CV to the magazine company HQ. After many efforts, they may be offered a lowly internship. It might take a few years and a lot of heartache before they realise that it wasn’t really the magazines themselves that were the true object of their attraction to begin with. Actually what was really speaking to this person was the idea of working in a close-knit team in an area that wasn’t finance (where Mum, a caustic and forbidding figure, puritanical in matters of sex and money, spent her career). Philosophical Meditation can, among other things, save us a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13903354509_d6a32bed18_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10073" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/13903354509_d6a32bed18_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="13903354509_d6a32bed18_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar dangers play out when one is upset or anxious. Imagine that yesterday you had dinner at the house of a conspicuously successful friend. They’d just got back from a holiday in the Maldives and were telling you about their latest business venture in pharmaceuticals. You left feeling restless and annoyed, but you didn’t know why. Your own life felt flat and dispiriting. Vague plans about what to do swirled around in your head. Maybe you could have a brilliant idea and start a business. Somehow you wanted your life to be more like your friend’s. But what is a brilliant idea in business? How does one get going? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then your partner said something about having set up a dinner with her mother. At that moment, from somewhere mysterious in you, you felt a wave of anger – and shouted something about the house always being left in such a mess. After all, there was a set of dirty plates in your field of vision. But your partner said you were crazy, the house wasn’t that messy anyway, and how long would it take to tidy away a few plates in the first place…? She walked out of the room crossly and so tonight, you’ll be sleeping on the sofa again for a whole set of reasons that it’s now becoming very hard to disentangle, let alone discuss with any degree of maturity.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2653370805_916f7c7b40_o.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10077" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2653370805_916f7c7b40_o.png?resize=635%2C423" alt="2653370805_916f7c7b40_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Countless agonies and mistakes stem from not properly analysing our confused inner experiences. We pick the wrong job; get together with the wrong person, run away from the right person; spend our money on the wrong things and don’t do justice to our talents and deeper aspirations. Acting without Philosophical Meditation is like being allowed to embark on a trip without checking the equipment or the map. We trust the feelings without duly acknowledging that they may prompt us in some catastrophic directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The longing to empty the mind, to calm turbulent thoughts isn’t completely opposed to the exercise of cleaning up the mind, decoding, analysing and ordering its contents. It’s just that at the moment, as societies, we have allowed ourselves to get overly seduced by the promise of tranquility, so that we always strive to empty the mind, instead of attempting to understand its contents. We see our agitation as the result of thinking too much, rather than of not having – as yet – thought enough. It’s time for our societies to take on board the promises and advantages of Philosophical Meditation.</span></p>

<p><b>THE ART OF CONVERSATION: </b></p>
<p><b>HOW CAN ONE IMPROVE and SPEED UP SELF-KNOWLEDGE</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the key ways in which we can get to know ourselves and others is through conversation. Unfortunately, we tend to have a ‘Romantic’ conception of conversation. We believe that in the right setting – distressed old wooden tables, food from Liguria, bruschetta – conversation will flow naturally, without special effort.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6268209746_06e24576aa_b1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10087" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6268209746_06e24576aa_b1.jpg?resize=635%2C549" alt="6268209746_06e24576aa_b" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reality is that conversation is an achievement, something we might need to learn. Key to it is having the right questions to hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Approach self-knowledge as a game. It can be fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at some very good questions to ask via the 100x question packs done by the School of Life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example:</span></p>
<p>What would you most like to be complimented on in a relationship? Where do you think you’re especially good as a person?</p>
<p>Which of your flaws do you want to be treated more generously?</p>
<p>What would you tell your younger self about love?</p>
<p>What is one incident you would like to apologise to a lover or friend for?</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9564599905_534e9ca52d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10081" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9564599905_534e9ca52d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C370" alt="9564599905_534e9ca52d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Finish the following sentences:</p>
<p>When I am anxious in a relationship, I tend to….</p>
<p>The other then tends to respond by….</p>
<p>which makes me…</p>
<p>When I argue, on the surface I show ……, but inside I feel….</p>
<p>Without thinking too hard, let’s finish these sentence stems about our feelings towards one another:</p>
<p>I resent…</p>
<p>I am puzzled by…</p>
<p>I am hurt by…</p>
<p>I regret…</p>
<p>I am afraid that…</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2157057475_af66695f52_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10083" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2157057475_af66695f52_z.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="2157057475_af66695f52_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>I am frustrated by…</p>
<p>I am happier when…</p>
<p>I want…</p>
<p>I appreciate…</p>
<p>I hope…</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
<p><b>What does the wise person end up knowing about themselves?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, what individuals know is specific to them. But we can still identify the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">kind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of things they know. If someone gains a lot of self-knowledge how would this show up in their behaviour? How would self-knowledge impact on their lives? Self-knowledge isn’t so much a set of statements that one gives assent to. Rather it’s a set of capacities for dealing better with one’s needs and weaknesses and generally being better at handling oneself. The wise, self-knowing person &#8230;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Would be less prone to blame others for their troubles. They get upset, they get bothered, they feel anxious; things still go wrong. But self-knowledge admits the full extent of responsibility. So annoyance doesn’t get channelled into being angry with the wrong person &#8211; who isn’t really to blame.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d likely be less frustrated at work: it’s not that they have the perfect job. They know themselves well enough to seek out the kind of work they can do comfortably; they don’t push needlessly to get ahead; they can cope fairly well with criticism, so they don’t get unduly anxious in a competitive environment.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d panic a bit less: panic is caused by fear; and mostly the fear is psychological, rather than physical &#8211; fear of humiliation of rejection or being bored. Great self-knowledge diminishes these fears.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’d be less prone to envy &#8211; because envy often comes from not quite knowing what you really need.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-10085" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C454" alt="197026314_5da7c6eb8b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t stress quite so much about money; that’s because they are more alert to what really matters to them; they are less given to impulse spending; they are better at saving.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They might have fewer crushes. They don’t project wildly onto others and so are less likely to suppose that a stranger glimpsed on a train or at the next table is their ideal soul-mate.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are good at apologising, partly because they can fully appreciate that they are at times very annoying &#8211; even if unintentionally so &#8211; to others. They can mull over the fact that they might be in the wrong, without getting too defensive.</span><strong><strong> </strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">They tend to be good conversationalists. Because they are alert to why they do things as they do &#8211; and don’t merely assert what they do think. They’re also slow to assume that others automatically think as they do. They can identify widely with different kinds of people because they can pick up on many different aspects of their own experience at different stages of life.</span></li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though charming people are a delight when we encounter them, most of us rarely think of consciously setting out to be charming. The very idea of learning to be more charming sounds off-key, for we tend to believe at some level that we are simply born charming or aren’t &#8211; and that any conscious attempt to acquire the quality would be fatefully lacking in authenticity. In other words, it seems rather wrong to think too hard about trying to get people to like us.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a pity, given how many important things need to be accompanied by a dose of charm in order to get going in the world. Ideas, projects, political proposals and people all stand in need of being presented in a charming way if they are to succeed and win an audience. It therefore seems a grievous surrender to fortune to leave charm only to those who spontaneously possess it &#8211; or to the apparently unscrupulous who are sanguine about plotting directly to obtain it.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5803157877_aa26beb765_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9557" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5803157877_aa26beb765_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="5803157877_aa26beb765_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, charm is a technique, neither sinister nor moral in itself, that can be used for good or ill and whose ultimate value depends on the purpose to which it is being applied. The world would be well served if the mechanics of charm were studied with particular energy by those with the best ends in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What, then, are some of the leading constituents of charm?</span></p>
<p><b>Familiarity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We grow up with an idea of politeness which is based on reigning in most of what human beings are and feel. This is often an extremely good idea. It can be deeply unpleasant to be given too close a tour of another person’s inner nature: their obsessions, envy, vindictiveness, despair or odours. Repression serves a sound overall function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, we can overshoot in this direction. We can end up associating politeness with such a stiff-backed reserve, we can be so coy about all the deeper, more appetitive, impulsive and emotional sides of our natures, that far from proving ingratiating, we end up repelling others through the blank impassivity of our facades.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9559" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="6399035975_f2202cdfe0_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The charming person understands that winning others over requires a careful revelation of some of the more intimate parts of themselves. They will, for example, express an opinion which runs counter to a standard line, but seems to better accord with the truth (that museum show really was a little tedious). Or maybe they will share an anxiety, a regret or a desire &#8211; moves which give others perspectives on more vulnerable, intimate dimensions. They might point out that they’re rather worried about a forthcoming meeting, sometimes think nostalgically back to being a child or occasionally feel like crying when they see a very old person in the street. They might, at a stiff dinner, say that they would love to drink a Coke.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the charming person is careful not to allow these revelations to spill over into demands on others: regrets don’t turn into whines, desires don’t lapse into compulsions; wayward appetites don’t disrupt routines. The charming person is master over themselves, they are allowing us a glimpse into a self which is at once complex and contained.</span></p>
<p><b>Warmth</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When trying to win others over, we try to make sure they are comfortable, at ease and have what they need. Hospitality is at the heart of charm.</span></p>
<p>However, when we are stiff (and scared), we operate with an unhelpful picture of what other people might really be like and in need of inside &#8211; and therefore cannot arrive at convincing accounts of what they would enjoy talking about, doing with their bodies, looking at or eating.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8590519418_6d9514c589_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9565" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8590519418_6d9514c589_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="8590519418_6d9514c589_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason for our lack of insight is that we are forgetting that others are likely to be &#8211; in most areas &#8211; really much like ourselves, which means rather different from the predominant social account of what ‘normal’ people are like. They too, are likely to share in some of our less prestigious but still deep-seated and important thoughts and needs. Even though nothing in their current demeanour would lead one to know this for certain, they too must &#8211; the ‘warm’ person guesses (out of a confidence in their own acceptability built up in a non-shaming childhood) &#8211; want to lounge on the sofa, eat things out of the fridge without ceremony, have a giggle, watch a particular show on TV or share a few lustful thoughts. The warm person has a secure enough sense of their own fundamental decency to be able to bring their own experiences into play when interpreting other people’s desires. They are asking themselves how they would be feeling in another’s shoes &#8211; and using this information in an active attempt to put others at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charming people will correctly hazard a guess that the other person might want to rest for a few hours or fancy discussing a couple at the table opposite or dance to some not especially fashionable music. They’ll know how important it is to know where the bathroom is and add that they often need to go themselves. They’ll know that it’s worrying for everyone (not just them) to meet a new person &#8211; and playfully allude to their shyness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The warm person has confidence in always being able to locate common ground, shared themes of vulnerable life that can overcome differences in cultures, ages or ranks.</span></p>
<p><b>Equality</b></p>
<p>Many encounters feature someone who is more powerful or important than somebody else; an inequality that can make for tension and anxiety &#8211; despite efforts to be polite.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2781182428_7274320116_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9567" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2781182428_7274320116_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="2781182428_7274320116_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>The powerful but charming person grasps that the predominant fear in their audience is that their status will have rendered them arrogant and invulnerable. They therefore take care very swiftly to say or do something that asserts their fundamental equality in areas outside of their obvious zone of superiority; they may be the CEO, but their toddler had a tantrum today (children are the best possible equalisers). They might have a great deal of money, but they have suffered a romantic misfortune. They are the King, but are &#8211; right now &#8211; dying to have a cheese sandwich, as you must be too. The frailties and ordinary desires of the powerful have a profoundly charming dimension, because we need so badly to hear that power understands our own concerns, needs and fears. What we call being charmed is, at heart, simply immense relief that we are not alone with our sorrows and difficulties in a stratified, hierarchical world.</p>
<p><b>Unshockability</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charming person allays our fears, universal in their existence though always particular in their nature, that we are at heart freakish, odd or shameful. They send out signals that we have leeway to reveal the less well-known and prestigious sides of our natures &#8211; because they are, they let on subtly, a little weird themselves and have a good-natured, unfrightened sense of the ubiquity of madness.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8707472000_882c6bbedd_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9569" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/8707472000_882c6bbedd_z.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="8707472000_882c6bbedd_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolved of the fear of being weird, we are then free to explain what we really need ourselves: perhaps another blanket, a lie-down, a conversation about a lover or a long trip to the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><b>Curiosity</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The charming person feels curious about others. They ask a lot of penetrating and energetic questions about the new person they have just encountered.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They aren’t just putting this on; their curiosity is the outcome of an underlying intellectual position on education. In essence, the curious person has a sense that they could learn from pretty much anyone they could meet. They don’t restrict curiosity to particular situations or people. They realise that there is something to be learnt pretty much everywhere, in every topic of conversation. They are therefore enriched rather than impoverished by social encounters. An account of someone’s holiday, the latest twist in the life of a pop star, a reflection on the weather, all of these can be sound enough starting points for substantial discoveries and therefore, the conversational direction of their interlocutors are never merely stamped out, but carefully extended and deepened.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3782142845_9ac60355d8_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9573" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/3782142845_9ac60355d8_o.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="3782142845_9ac60355d8_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The curious person feels that bits of the truth have become lodged in a huge variety of topics &#8211; a cognitive version of the Christian idea that there is a bit of the divine in everyone. They have no sense of restriction about where they might land upon something interesting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These factors are what make a person charming. They are not mysterious, random gifts of nature. They are, instead, the result of certain strategic bits of knowledge and insight. Becoming more charming is a matter of taking to heart these ideas around warmth, equality, unshockability and curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being charming isn’t simply a nice optional extra. It’s central to dealing effectively with practical problems. We’re so often held up by difficulties with other people, who we struggle to persuade, motivate and get on side. Charm is a major mechanism for having an impact. The more important and worthwhile our objectives the more important it is to be able to deploy charm to further them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charm is neither superficial nor the special preserve of those with questionable intentions. At its best, it is a virtue which enables good people to extend their influence in the world.  </span></p>

<p class="p1">We apparently live in an age of honesty and disclosure but in truth most of what we are remains unacceptable and disguised to the world. We simply cannot show too much of our real natures and retain the affections of others. As a result, we&#8217;re lonely with parts of our characters we simply don&#8217;t hear anyone else admitting to. One of the functions of art is to break that loneliness, by taking us into the secret unmentioned thoughts with dignity and occasional humor.</p>
<p class="p1">The films below gently show us that in our hearts, almost all of us are rather more envious, internet addicted, romantic and greedy than we are ever able to let on.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When we fail and mess up in our lives (perhaps a project at work goes wrong or a relationship ends), our moods are at risk of heading towards two extremes: self-pity on the one hand, where it is exclusively everyone else’s fault and we bathe in a sense of our innocence and purity. And on the other, self-flagellation, where we blame only ourselves, tear ourselves apart and constantly replay evidence of our waywardness and sheer stupidity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-flagellation is &#8211; for many of us &#8211; the greater risk. To survive in the high-pressured conditions of modernity, we have little option but to grow up to be highly adept at self-criticism, at swiftly picking up on our errors and taking stock of our short-comings. We learn to take responsibility and to be open to feedback. But so good are we at this that we’re in danger of falling prey to an excessive version of self-criticism: a form of self-flagellation which teaches us nothing new and inspires only depression and underperformance. We have taken self-criticism too far when it no longer has any effect on our level of achievement, when it simply saps our morale and our will to get out of bed.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/466817135_812705e91f_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8839" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/466817135_812705e91f_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="466817135_812705e91f_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s at this point that we need to carve out some time to sample an emotional state of which many of us are profoundly suspicious: self-compassion. We’re suspicious because we are nervously over-familiar with the risks associated with self-pity. We are frightened creatures always looking out for signs that we have grown soft. Most of us will have given up on the last traces of self-pity somewhere in late adolescence, but the condition remains vivid. We are aware that, by being kind to ourselves, we may over-indulge our undeserving characters, miss valuable insights and ruin our potential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because depression and self-disgust are serious enemies too, we need to re-learn the value of calculated moments of self-compassion; we need to appreciate the role of self-care in a good, ambitious and fruitful life.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8842" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="1814098643_9ac4011e5a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this end, we should perform a Self-Compassion Exercise, a structured Meditation (lasting 15 minutes or so) where we turn over a sequence of thoughts in our minds that correct the worst self-accusations of our sadder moments. For a time, until we are stronger, we vow to adopt an entirely kindly perspective on our setbacks. We have failed, but the conclusion does not have to be that we are idiots. The following ideas can be rehearsed:</span></p>
<p><strong>1. The task was very hard</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re so in love with success, we fail to notice the scale of the challenges we routinely set ourselves. There is nothing remotely normal about what we are trying to achieve.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. We weren’t properly equipped by our histories</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We need to consider our biographies in their entireties; not just this or that setback, but the course of our lives as a whole. There were things which happened to us at the hands of others which can help to explain our current failures. We were not responsible for everything. We are in part victims of things beyond our control. We are not in complete command of who we are, and shouldn’t &#8211; therefore &#8211; be held to account for everything.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16777983089_f0353ce88b_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8847" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16777983089_f0353ce88b_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="16777983089_f0353ce88b_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Failure is not unique</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nature of the task means there is always a high possibility of failure. Failure is rarely spoken about. The media talks mostly of successes (or the spectacular blow-ups), but statistically, what has happened to us was always going to be more likely. ‘Better men fared thus before you,’ said Matthew Arnold, people who are even more talented than you didn’t succeed. It isn’t just that you are a fool: it was a mountain to climb.</span></p>
<p><strong>4. Luck is real</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tough, self-critical people don’t allow themselves the indulgence of believing in luck. They take responsibility for everything. They think winners make their own luck. They don’t. Luck is a genuine feature of existence. We are robbing ourselves of genuine and fair consolation by believing that we are entirely in control &#8211; and therefore entirely to blame when we crash. We are not losers in a game that was fair. We are unfortunates in an often highly random unlucky universe.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15827903959_b3976cba53_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8851" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/15827903959_b3976cba53_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="15827903959_b3976cba53_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><strong>5. Your whole worth is not dependent on external things</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your essential lovability does not have to be at stake in this issue. You are not only your achievements. Status and material success is one bit of you, but there are lots of other parts too. Those who loved you in childhood knew this and, in their best moments, helped you to feel it. Adopt a maternal relationship with yourself: rehearse the internalised voices of all those who have been kind to you, bathe in an intrinsic absolute love independent of achievement. Imagine a maternal figure. Let yourself listen to voices you haven’t given time for in years. Perhaps it isn’t unconditional love, it’s just that there are other conditions for love, which you happen to pass quite well. You are kind, interesting, witty, sensitive, bold, imaginative&#8230; Modern society has over-emphasised certain conditions for love, pegging them too neatly to a narrow range of victories. You should be allowed to exist and tolerate yourself without these badges.</span></p>
<p><strong>6. There is a way out of this that you can’t quite see now</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are exhausted, and panicked. You can’t see how you could move on from this. That’s not the truth, it’s merely how it feels when self-criticism has destroyed every bit of confidence. You need time without pressure. You need to sleep and nurture yourself. We have grown too good at giving the case to the prosecution. Shut out the voice of Duty and Anger.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/233842170_4bf3079c3d_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8854" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/233842170_4bf3079c3d_z.jpg?resize=635%2C649" alt="233842170_4bf3079c3d_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-compassion is different from saying you are innocent. It&#8217;s trying to be pretty gentle and understanding about why you failed. You’ve been a fool, but you deserve to exist with dignity and to be understood and forgiven. It’s a fundamental right for us all.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Evolution is one of the biggest ideas in the modern world. It was most memorably formulated by Charles Darwin in the 19th century.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Part of the theory focuses on the tendency of genes to mutate. When a frog – or microbe or giraffe – has a gene mutation, it usually that means they’ll be unsuited to their environment and they’ll die.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But very occasionally, just by chance, the mutation gives them an advantage and makes them more successful. The mutation is passed on to their descendants, who will have the same advantage as their parents, and their resultant success will spread it ever further down the generations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7620" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop.jpg?resize=635%2C593" alt="684px-Charles_Darwin_seated_crop" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<h5 class="p1">Charles Darwin</h5>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the key thing about gene mutation is that it takes time: a lot of it. It took us around 3,900 million years to go from the first cells to homo sapiens. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So the one thing we can be pretty sure about is that genetic mutation will not be a significant feature of the human world now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, there’s a second, equally interesting bit to Darwin’s theory of Evolution, which focuses on what gets called Adaptation to the Environment. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin pointed out that when an environment changes, a characteristic can suddenly shift from being an advantage to a disadvantage &#8211; and vice versa. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In 1811, a famous survey of moths around the burgeoning town of Manchester recorded no melanic &#8211; or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>black-winged &#8211; moths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thirty-seven<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>years later, in 1848,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>another survey discovered huge number of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>creatures and far fewer white winged moths. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin’s explanation was simple: Manchester’s rise as a major industrial city meant that huge quantities of soot had entered the atmosphere and darkened tree trunks. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thereafter, light-winged moths became highly conspicuous to their main predators &#8211; birds &#8211; while the dark winged ones were effectively camouflaged. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7621" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Biston.betularia.f.carbonaria.7209" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Darwin concluded that changes to the environment can dramatically alter which members of a species will thrive within it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This happens in the human world, where it doesn’t affect reproductive potential, but does change the social hierarchy. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Consider, for instance, the classic example of our age: the rise of the nerd. Being short sighted, timid, having poor muscular development, being obsessed with complex abstract processes and being short on charisma and social skills used to be a recipe for an unsuccessful life. That’s because, for most of history, making your way in the world was hugely dependent on physical strength and and strong practical links to a family group. The weakling, the loner, the introvert was in a very disadvantageous position. Then, in the last quarter of the 20th century, the tech industry created an environment in which nerd characteristics turned out to be highly advantageous.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4668258939_fa22a95d40_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7622" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/4668258939_fa22a95d40_z.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="4668258939_fa22a95d40_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Human beings are not themselves now evolving (or too slowly to matter), but our environment is changing very fast, and this has hugely privileged certain traits while penalising others. A key dynamic of evolution &#8211; Adaptation to the Environment &#8211; is still around, even though gene mutation is not a notable factor.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Some of us are like the black moths of Industrial Manchester, ideally suited to the new world, which rewards massive intellect, self-discipline and rationality. Others &#8211; many many of us &#8211; are like white moths in a sooty world. We find it hard to</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– not to eat too much</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to distinguish real threats from baseless anxieties</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to spend all day in an office in front of a computer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to look at porn in moderation</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– to be monogamous</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">– and to defer gratification for years while we collaborate on large projects inside the glass towers of corporations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We should feel compassion for ourselves when we don’t quite fit our times. Our biology has saddled us with a range of cognitive habits which were sensible when they evolved (habits around sugar, sex, power, anxiety and excitement)… but which really hamper our effectiveness in the modern world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>An understanding of the theory of evolution should move us to sympathy for why we do some of the deeply counterproductive things we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When he first wrote about evolution, Charles Darwin was accused of demeaning human nature. Cartoonists loved to draw him as an ape. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7623" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/5.Darwin-as-monkey.jpg-acr.jpg?resize=450%2C583" alt="5.Darwin as monkey.jpg- acr" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Darwin was deeply kind and helpful to humans. He was reminding us that we carry with us a lot of baggage, which we won’t now need but can’t get rid of very fast. Modern life has required things of us which are really very hard for us to pull off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We’re saddled with many inconvenient but maddeningly deep-rooted tendencies &#8211; which is another reason why we constantly need to be a little more forgiving of other people and of ourselves. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It really matters what we think of as ‘being normal,&#8217; because we are collective creatures. We&#8217;re acutely receptive to group dynamics and sensitive to where we fit in – or the ways in which we don’t. No matter how much we praise individualism and see ourselves as unique we are, in fact, deeply influenced by our picture of what is &#8216;normal&#8217; in our society.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is a problem because our picture of what is normal is in fact &#8211; very often &#8211; way, way out of line with what is actually true and widespread. Many things that we might assume are uniquely odd or disconcertingly strange – and which cut us off from other people – are in fact completely average and ubiquitous: </span></p>
<p class="p1"><em><strong><span class="s1">If you … </span></strong></em></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- sense you’ve married the wrong person</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- get sick with envy when a friend succeeds</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- think about your partner&#8217;s sister in bed</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- want to cry when anyone criticises you</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- dislike the way you look</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- worry a great deal about farting in public</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- feel you might vomit in a meeting out of fear</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- can’t sleep well in hotels</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- find that your voice starts to give way or crack when you have to speak to anyone important</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- are worried about sitting on a dirty toilet seat</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- trip over tiny cracks in the pavement</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- have sexual thoughts about members of your own family</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- bump your head trying to get nonchalantly into a taxi</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The picture of normality has been drawn, in our culture, by slightly brutish characters. It’s not simply that the picture has tended to stress externals over internals: suggesting to us that it’s normal to have a gleaming kitchen or go on a foreign holiday every year. It’s rather that the assumptions about what it’s like to be alive, to be a human being, have been skewed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.freshome.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/importance-of-licing-and-dining-areas.jpg?resize=546%2C431" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Our culture has tried to project an idea of an organised, poised and polished self, as the standard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>way most people are. And this encourages us to get impatient and disgusted with ourselves when we don’t live up to expectations. We want to shout that we need to buck up, get it together and stop being so weak or so weird. But instead of expecting ourselves to be normal in the sense of being calm, coherent and rational, and getting ashamed when we&#8217;re not, it’s far better to recognise the omnipresence and sheer normality of madness, waywardness and alarm in every single human soul.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To wonder too insistently what &#8216;the meaning of life&#8217; might be marks you out as being somewhat heavy, weird or just naïve.</p>
<p>People nowadays often say – sometimes in a sad way, other times more aggressively and cynically – that &#8216;life just has no meaning.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5758" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix.jpg?resize=635%2C448" alt="640px-Caravaggio.emmaus.750pix" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Two reasons are often cited for this. The first has to do with<strong> religion</strong>. Once upon a time, so the story goes, life had a clear meaning given to us by God: it was about worshiping Him and living according to His dictates. But as religious belief has declined, not only has god supposedly died, but along with him, the meaning he once guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>Modern science</strong> is the second cause of the current crisis of meaning. Scientists tell us that existence, which emerged from a random interplay of chemicals and gases, does have meaning, but it&#8217;s of a rather bleak, relentless and narrow sort: for humans – as for all other living things (like amoeba) – the meaning of life is survival and the propagation of one&#8217;s genetic material. It sounds very true and at the same time, distinctly futile and melancholy.</p>
<p>Here we want to argue as follows: to wonder about the meaning of life is an extremely important activity, life <em>does</em> have substantial meaning – and there are, in fact, a range of practical steps we can take to ensure we end up leading lives of maximal meaningfulness.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/461220924.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5762" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/461220924.jpg?resize=635%2C435" alt="KYRGYZSTAN-BUTTERFLY-EXHIBITION" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>We should start by saying that there is no meaning in life outside of that which we can find by ourselves as a species. There isn&#8217;t any kind of objective meaning written in the stars, in a holy book or in sequences of DNA.</p>
<p>What seems to prompt people to complain that life lacks meaning are particular varieties of unhappiness. Let&#8217;s consider some central examples:</p>
<p>– You&#8217;re in a relationship, but the intensity you experienced at the start has long gone. You don&#8217;t seem to talk about anything important any more or share vulnerable feelings and ideas. It feels, as you put it, &#8216;meaningless&#8217;. Or else you&#8217;re single and, though you have many friends, every time you see them, the conversation seems shallow and trivial.</p>
<p>– You are at university studying for a degree. You signed up for the course in part because you often feel confused about who you are and what you want. You thought that reading books and going to lectures would shine a light on things, but the topics are dull and disconnected from your confusion. You complain it feels meaningless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/129033328.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5764" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/129033328.jpg?resize=635%2C427" alt="Universities Face Jump In Student Enrollment" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>– You&#8217;re working in a large profitable company and earning a decent sum every week, but the work doesn&#8217;t seem, in the grander scheme, important. By which you mean two things: that you don&#8217;t seem to be making any great difference to anyone&#8217;s life and also that there&#8217;s no profound part of you that you&#8217;re able to bring to, or incorporate in, your work. It might as well be done by a robot.</p>
<p>From these strands, we can start to extrapolate a theory of meaning.</p>
<p>Meaning is to be found in three activities in particular: <strong>Communication, Understanding</strong> and <strong>Service.</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at <strong>communication</strong> first. We are, by nature, isolated creatures and it appears that some of our most meaningful moments are to do with instances of connection: with a lover, for example, when we reveal our intimate physical and psychological selves, or when we form friendships where substantial truths about our respective lives can be shared. Or on a journey to a new country, when we strike up a conversation with a stranger and feel a thrilling sense of victory over linguistic and cultural barriers. Or when we are touched by books, songs, and films that put their fingers on emotions that are deeply our own but that we had never witnessed externalized so clearly or beautifully before.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/907711071.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5772" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/907711071.jpg?resize=635%2C425" alt="Old man talking to Colin Wills of the BBC during a train journey, 1950." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the meaning that emerges via <strong>understanding</strong>. This is about the pleasure that can be felt whenever we correct confusion and puzzlement about ourselves or the world. We might be scientific researchers, or economists, poets or patients in psychotherapy; the pleasure of our activities stems from a common ability to map and make sense of what was once painfully unfamiliar and strange.</p>
<p>Thirdly, there&#8217;s<strong> service</strong>. One of the most meaningful things we can do is to serve other people, to try to improve their lives, either by alleviating sources of suffering or else by generating new sources of pleasure. So we might be working as cardiac surgeons and aware every day of the meaning of our jobs or else be in a company that&#8217;s making a modest but real difference to people&#8217;s lives by helping them get a better night&#8217;s sleep, finding their keys or thrilling them aesthetically with elegant furniture or harmonious tunes. Or else our service might be to friends or our own families, or perhaps the earth itself. We&#8217;re often told to think of ourselves as inherently selfish. But some of the most meaningful moments come when we transcend our egos and put ourselves at the service of others – or the planet. One should add that in order for service to feel meaningful, it has to be in synch with our native, sincere interests. Not everyone will find medicine or social work, ballet or graphic design meaningful. It&#8217;s a case of knowing enough about ourselves to find our particular path to service.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/146089987.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5766" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/146089987.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Spain Continues To Struggle With The Economic Crisis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Armed with such ideas, we can move towards defining nothing less than the meaning of life. The meaning of life is to pursue human flourishing through communication, understanding and service.</p>
<p>In order to have meaningful lives, we can also see that certain things will need to be in play.</p>
<p>We need to have relationships with others: not necessarily romantic ones (that&#8217;s been way overdone in our society), but connections of some kind where the important things are shared. It might, of course, be relationships with books or songs.</p>
<p>We also need to have a culture conducive to fostering an understanding of oneself and the world. The enemies of this include being surrounded by mass media that throws out chaotic information or an academic environment that promotes dead, sterile investigations.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/135830920.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5769" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/135830920.jpg?resize=635%2C320" alt="A customer stands next to the TV screens" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And lastly we need to have good work, which means a world filled with businesses and organisations geared towards not just profit, but the assistance and genuine improvement of human kind. In addition, we need to help people to discover their own particular inner &#8216;tune&#8217; that they can put into their work, so that people aren&#8217;t just serving per se, but serving in a way that taps into their heartfelt interests.</p>
<p>There are, sadly, a lot of obstacles to meaningful lives. In the area of communication: it&#8217;s things like an over-emphasis on sex, an underplaying of friendship, a lack of neighbourliness or an absence of nourishing culture. It&#8217;s also, at an internal level, bugs in one&#8217;s emotional software that make one afraid to get close to others.</p>
<p>In the area of understanding, it&#8217;s a lack of good media, a suspicion of introspection and psychotherapy, and a pompous and disconnected academic world.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1323531.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5770" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/1323531.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Prince William''s Future University In Scotland" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>And in the area of service, it&#8217;s an over-exaggerated concern for money in individuals and companies that puts the focus on financial gain over the genuine needs of others. It&#8217;s overly large systems in which the individual is lost and can&#8217;t see the impact of his or her work. And internally, it might be about an inner timidity, snobbery or a follow-the-herd mentality, which prevents one from properly getting to know oneself and one&#8217;s authentic talents.</p>
<p>To build a more meaningful world, we have to place the emphasis on emotional education, on community, on a culture of introspection and on a more honest kind of capitalism.</p>
<p>We may not have meaningful lives yet, but it&#8217;s central to affirm that the concept of a meaningful life is eminently plausible – and that it comprises elements that can be clearly named and gradually fought for.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We should start by admitting that the drive for perfection can be an astonishing, admirable and fruitful human capacity. Perfectionism is at play in a snooker break of 147; Tolstoy’s <i>Death of Ivan Ilyich; </i>the gold medal Olympic ten meter dive; Bach’s <i>St Matthew Passion; </i>Mies van der Rohe&#8217;s Barcelona Pavilion&#8230;</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Perfectionism can take a grip anywhere in life, but it is particularly evident in certain areas. The material realm for a start. There can be a yearning for an environment that is entirely neat, clean, harmonious and beautiful. For example: for a kitchen which is spotless; or for a serene and perfectly ordered living room or for an office in which all the plugs and wires are hidden away; the desk is not crowded; and everything has a drawer to go into. Romantic life is similarly marked by deep longings for perfection. There is the aspiration to be wholly understood by someone who combines beauty, wisdom, grace and kindness. We may similarly dream of the perfect family: children who get along well with each other, who are close to their parents and who do their homework enthusiastically. There is intense perfectionism around art as well: we may want to paint a picture which perfectly encapsulates a mood; take a photograph which faithfully expresses one’s experience or write a story that completely evokes the sense of a particular place.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460701678.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5594" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/460701678.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Olympic champions in Synchronized Swimming Present a Show" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We are perfectionists because our imaginations are so adept at conjuring up improved images of life. This is very useful and necessary in many situations. We need to be able to imagine good scenarios so as to gain the energy and focus to try to bring them about. In the early stages of human history, people had to imagine things they didn’t have: a ready supply of fresh drinking water; a way of protecting themselves from wild animals at night&#8230; </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Ideally, the imagination would be limited to prompting ambitions which were within practical reach. But the imagination inherently overshoots. It isn’t good at tailoring its suggestions to an accurate assessment of both our personal abilities and how hospitable the outer world might be to our desires. It seems we have been endowed by nature with drives which are beneficial to the species, but may not work to our own particular advantage as individuals. As with salmon leaping up waterfalls to return to their original spawning grounds, we are hardwired with imperatives (to succeed, to win, to master), which have no regard for our personal capacities to deliver on them. Nature doesn’t care that we ourselves can&#8217;t write a particular sonata or launch a cherished business idea; our drives are independent of our talents to deliver on them. Only one salmon in a thousand ends up reproducing successfully&#8230;</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/457947984.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5598" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/457947984.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Salmon Tagged As They Swim Upstream From The Atlantic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> It&#8217;s in part the fault of the modern world. Until recently, ambition was for the very few. Then came America. Since 1945, the American Dream has (across the globe) projected all sorts of notions: the idea that everyone can attain material prosperity and have a happy home life, that it is normal for couples to have wry but deeply loyal and contented relationships, that sexual fulfilment is possible over decades with the same person, that neighbours on the whole can be great friends, that children typically have immense respect for their parents (tempered by occasional light teasing); that everyone can be a winner at the office. The American Dream has vastly increased opportunities for happiness &#8211; and, of course, at the same time, also expanded the spectre of panic and difficult perfectionism. It has moved a great many areas of human activity from the realm of things that were deemed very likely to go badly wrong – to the realm of things that could and should be perfect if only one can follow a few simple and fairly easy rules. It has made hope the norm and internalised the burdens of failure. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">The standard line is hence to say that perfectionism is impossible and should be given up on at once. We’re typically invited to imagine that the mature, wise life is one that has shed all links to perfectionism. The very term ‘perfectionist’ is generally used as a criticism: to point out when someone sets unnecessarily, even ridiculously, high standards for themselves and others. It is in the same territory as fussy, pedantic and obsessive.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/89660023.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5600" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/89660023.jpg?resize=635%2C418" alt="Mies Van de Rohe ¥s pavilion, Barcelona Sculpture of the Mies Van de Rohe ¥s pavilion, Barcelona" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> But perfectionism is not always wrong. And, strikingly, when we encounter things we do consider perfect (like, perhaps, the music of Bach or the villas of Palladio), we don’t usually call their creators perfectionists. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> So really, we just have to get a little better at handling our perfectionism. For a start, we have to learn how much effort is required to get anything to go well. In a culture like ours, which generally tries to please the consumer, the pains of the producer are kept well out of sight. The chef’s nightly anxiety over creating a dish is carefully hidden from the customers. The child does not know the level of effort, self doubt and worry that the parent contends with; we don&#8217;t think about the struggles going on in the cockpit, on the factory floor or in the boardroom.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/51539163.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5602" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/51539163.jpg?resize=635%2C440" alt="Picture dated 16 October 2004 of villa R" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We are always exposed first to the competence of the practiced professional. It is only when we take the path from consumer to producer that we are confronted with how tricky it all really is, and how feeble and inadequate our own resources are likely to be. So we need a saner picture of how much agony lies behind everything we admire and wish to emulate.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Good perfectionism means being able to tolerate the torments of imperfection – in oneself and others – for long, tumultuous periods. Success means having to forgive oneself the horrors of the first draft.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> We need similar degrees of patience when it comes to love. The foiled perfectionist tends to lash out; but no one was ever changed by being called unpleasant things and having a door slammed on them. The intensity of<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>disappointment at certain failures in our partners can be so great, it cuts us off from the poise necessary to educate them into respecting (and then perhaps) living up to one’s vision. One ends up shouting when one should have patiently explained. The good solution is not necessarily for the perfectionist to give up on their devotions, just to get better at explaining and sharing them. Perfectionists forget what it is like not to be them: to be unimpressed or indifferent towards topics which feel so spontaneously crucial to them.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462007584.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5603" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/462007584.jpg?resize=635%2C411" alt="Greece Prepares For This Weekend's General Election" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> The improvement of others &#8211; which the perfectionist is after &#8211; requires boundless reserves of kindness, patience and gentleness. That is, it requires a more accurate insight into the difficulties a basically kind and clever person might genuinely face when dealing with an issue (punctuality, keeping the kitchen clean etc.) which comes very easily to one. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Of course, there will be certain areas in which we simply have to surrender our perfectionism.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/157877021.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5610" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/157877021.jpg?resize=635%2C422" alt="Woman trying to clear and get on top of housework." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> The trick is to accept that good enough can be good enough. Perfectionists assume that it is only the flawless version of something that is worth having. They feel: if we are late, the evening can’t be a success. If the car is scratched, I can’t enjoy driving it; if the room is untidy, I can’t love my home. To cope, they need to learn how imperfect something can be and yet still retain a great deal of its charm.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Statistics can help too. Because the media concentrates on success stories, the remedy is more accurate information. We need to know the true incidence of arguments in couples, or of failures among businesses or of despair in the hearts of good people.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_605079m.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5609" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/rexfeatures_605079m.jpg?resize=635%2C417" alt="Woody Allen and Diane Keaton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Humour helps as well. There’s a particular vein of humour that gets us to take generous pleasure in the failings of others. <i>Monsieur Hulot&#8217;s Holiday</i> or Woody Allen’s <i>Annie Hall</i> show us characters who fail profoundly &#8211; by the standards of the quest for perfection &#8211; but still end up end being rather nice people, worthy of tenderness and sympathy. We don’t laugh out of contempt, but because we are charmed. The klutz walks into the door, the nerd fails to get the girl, someone gets fired, the holidays go wrong &#8211; and yet we are not downcast. Humour allows us to see that we don’t need everything to be perfect in order for it to be acceptable. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"> Finally, we need friends whom we can regularly commune with around failure. We pay a high price for our furtiveness about our own setbacks. We dwell in a glossy world in which being successful seems almost the equivalent to being an acceptable person. We don’t want to look foolish and don’t want other people to write us off as failures. But failure in most areas is the (secret) norm. We misjudge how common are our tribulations. Admitting imperfection is part of learning how to have a slightly less damaged and slightly less punitive inner life. </span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1174px-StillLifeWithASkull.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5294" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/1174px-StillLifeWithASkull.jpg?resize=635%2C487" alt="1174px-StillLifeWithASkull" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>For centuries, artists produced ‘<em>memento mori</em>’, works of art that would remind their viewers of death and usually featured a skull or an hourglass.</p>
<p>The point of these works wasn’t to make people despair, but to help them use the thought of death to focus on the real priorities. Vivid reminders of mortality and the transient nature of life put our prosaic obsessions into question. When measured against the finality of death, the true insignificance of some of our worries is emphasised and we’re given an opportunity to feel a little braver about what we really want and feel.</p>
<p>At the Book of Life, we&#8217;re fascinated by the concept of memento mori and have made 5 paperweight memento mori. The first one references the stars. Globular clusters like this one are dense bunches of hundreds of thousands of stars formed over 13 billion years ago. This image, taken by the Hubble telescope, says nothing directly about what happened today at work or in our relationships. Its function is to make us feel small. That’s normally unpleasant, but to be made to feel small by something so much more majestic and powerful than we are has something redeeming and enhancing about it. The image is sombre, rather than sad: calming, but not despair inducing. And in that condition of mind, we are left better equipped to deal with the intense, intractable and particular problems and griefs we have to deal with in our few years on this planet</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/memento-mori-paperweight-stars/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8310" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Memento_box_low-res-21.jpg?resize=635%2C508" alt="Memento_box_low-res-2" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>There are (very roughly) seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains of sand on the earth. The most common constituent of sand is silica, the second is aragonite, which has been created, over the past half billion years, from the crushed remains of various forms of life, like coral and shellfish. Pick up some grains, put them under a microscope and whole worlds appear. In certain strands of Zen Buddhism, sages train themselves to be content to stare for many hours at only a few grains, a symbol of their capacity to pay due attention to the neglected wonders of existence. We too should be content to look closely at grains in a spirit of modesty and humility – and acknowledge that we are, from a sufficient perspective, nothing more substantial than such grains and yet no less interesting or complex for that.</p>

<p>This is a highly magnified image of a single-celled diatom algae. It is one of the tiniest and oldest living things on the planet. The naturalist Charles Darwin wrote about it to emphasise an idea that remains momentous: that we humans evolved from other, simpler species. At the time, this was taken to be dangerously demeaning. But it’s a hugely liberating lesson. Often we expect too much from ourselves and others. We forget our origins as smaller, hairier primates and (before that) simple clusters of cells, like these algae. We need to climb down, and recall our mortality, our frailty, our terrible limitations and our weaknesses – which are tied to our deep ancestry as tiny things at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eubaphe mendica, also known as the Beggar, is a small yellow moth of fragile appearance and almost translucent wings. In her famous essay, ‘The Death of the Moth’, the English writer Virginia Woolf describes the final moments of just such a moth. It is trapped against a pane of glass. It cannot understand its predicament. It keeps trying to get through, but its energies are limited, its knowledge is too small and its lifespan is desperately short. To be touched by this is to be touched – ultimately – by our own similar fate. We too have brief existences which we risk (so very easily) in hopeless, mistaken efforts; we too are misled, fatally, by things that we think are attractive, and for us as well, death comes far sooner than we would like.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop/memento-mori-paperweight-algae-1/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8314" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Memento_box_low-res-3.jpg?resize=635%2C424" alt="Memento_box_low res-3" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Many of the obstacles we face in our lives are rather like the waves of the sea: relentless, bleak, repetitive and, ultimately, not responsive to our wishes or longings.This is not a cruel fact about one’s own predicament; it is a basic premise of the human condition. Therefore, one should not bring unreasonable expectations and be continually shocked and dismayed when life does not answer to our demands. We should learn to accept all we cannot change and face it with a degree of heroism and Stoic strength, as a sailor battling the waves might. We can also, in the midst of our struggles, appreciate the beauty and grandeur of what we’re up against.</p>

<p>But we should try also to understand where procrastination comes from. It isn&#8217;t merely to do with laziness. A lot of is &#8211; at heart &#8211; fear. We begin to work only when the fear of doing nothing at all exceeds the fear of not doing it very well&#8230; And that can take time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">For all of them, it started much as it will for you: a strangely persistent itch at the back of the head, a discomfort on the left side, a lump fingered in the shower. Something it became impossible to ignore.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then came the trip to the doctor, the encouraging words from friends, the dropped voices and then the news, which – despite all the evidence – continues to surprise us all, to seem like an error, an appalling clerical mistake from Satan.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1766" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/nelly.jpg" alt="nelly" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Nelly: “After I received my diagnosis, I cried every day.”</span></h5>
<p class="p2">Some submit at once, a few vow to fight what science insists can never be vanquished, most veer painfully from hope to despair.</p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1768" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/sarah_pic.jpg" alt="sarah_pic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Sarah: “When I first heard, I said we’re going to fight this, we’re going to beat this…”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The American photographer Andrew George took his camera into the hospices of California that we would otherwise never dare to visit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">He wanted unremarkable people, but they emerge as anything but. Their story will be ours, an idea that today still remains almost impossible to admit to ourselves or to pay due homage to, through the rounds of ordinary distractions and commitments. We seem, day to day, simply so eternal, unfortunately for us…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dying have momentous things to say to all of us, even when they say them in simple unschooled words. Their pronouncements become like those of prophets; they have gone ahead of us to tell us the truths we don’t have the courage for right now. These men and women, none of whom have more than a few days left to live, speak with the clarity, the lack of pretension, the utter sincerity of the damned.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1769" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/W6NHVOOhQaPpJgEgwTH1PuVB_ytHNiIqMbcpe3YH_ikCgsYwO416n5wKeQEfNJWABd6gqFwTGZEnnVyPY45u0Y.jpg" alt="W6NHVOOhQaPpJgEgwTH1PuVB_ytHNiIqMbcpe3YH_ikCgsYwO416n5wKeQEfNJWABd6gqFwTGZEnnVyPY45u0Y" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Abel: “You have a one way ticket, don’t waste it!”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The dying are the great appreciators of this world: they notice the sunshine on the roller blind, the laughter of a grandchild, another breath… And they know what spoilt ingrates we all are, not stopping to register the wonder of every passing minute. They were once like us of course. They know they wasted decades and from their beds, they strive to tell us of their folly and warn us of our own.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1770" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/y2sPhR86mbUaUVtjehn0haUHsgZbjGg9dqFkjEuF-HQvL8JAQL0ObUv86vjjq11tKNAsPs2YKt6EJ52ORRKZVc.jpg" alt="y2sPhR86mbUaUVtjehn0haUHsgZbjGg9dqFkjEuF-HQvL8JAQL0ObUv86vjjq11tKNAsPs2YKt6EJ52ORRKZVc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Kim: “There’s so many things to enjoy and we don’t enjoy them.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is the time for confession and for admissions of weakness. This is no occasion for pride. You can admit all the many things that went wrong, the evasions, cowardice, bitterness and betrayals that are the hidden mortar of every life.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1771" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/e8U62N5Z4MI-y1j3GiUIPwM52srbhhTfHmHtpL7Yuoc.jpg" alt="e8U62N5Z4MI-y1j3GiUIPwM52srbhhTfHmHtpL7Yuoc" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Donald: “Even though my ex-wife remarried and loved another man, I still love her.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The things that the dying cherish most have no connection with what is deemed important by the competitive world. Childhood is always mentioned, the time when death had no presence yet, when there were only nightmares that could be comforted away by a loving hand. Now the nightmares have colonised the days. This is worse than any ghost or zombie a childhood imagination could have dreamt up.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1772" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/9wUqiwjOK6AB8ddrTkObk1gNSNuuFlMVTyZoayM9BaYXnesIpmxO3mNtBDgwSX_9bWBVZ2F-nS_6s4vJgrpmyg.jpg" alt="9wUqiwjOK6AB8ddrTkObk1gNSNuuFlMVTyZoayM9BaYXnesIpmxO3mNtBDgwSX_9bWBVZ2F-nS_6s4vJgrpmyg" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Chuck: “Some of my favourite times were as kids; me and my brothers used to play baseball and my mom would join us.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We may want to cry, for them and of course, as it should be, for us.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Death is the great re-organiser. It refashions ambition, it encourages us to attach new value to things we hardly would have thought of as goals of any kind.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1773" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OJbyktiaHPnC3JlzQeREZQzmDFsdMfg4UgZ8FuL7PwkJ9VkM33zh7ZeS49BaV3y7MFXf3oIZG89hSCJ7JIrCwc-635x475.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="OJbyktiaHPnC3JlzQeREZQzmDFsdMfg4UgZ8FuL7PwkJ9VkM33zh7ZeS49BaV3y7MFXf3oIZG89hSCJ7JIrCwc-635x475" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Irene: “I would love to be seventy years old.”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We will leave very few traces. Our monuments are shockingly small, but all the more genuine and heartbreaking for being so. We can count ourselves lucky for living on in the hearts of a few for half a decade or so.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1774" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2tf7t6FWvKggn2e8gafeKgA3WHutYMNGYZahStMwEjY6AuqaSZvSZwlSLGfxCqQuQcUl-SLLCLNKgZptX4Ijl8-635x475.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="2tf7t6FWvKggn2e8gafeKgA3WHutYMNGYZahStMwEjY6AuqaSZvSZwlSLGfxCqQuQcUl-SLLCLNKgZptX4Ijl8-635x475" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5 class="p1"><span class="s1">Odis: “I’ll be remembered for my red beet jam and quilting…”</span></h5>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every age should be in search of effective ways to keep death in mind. Once we would look at skulls or at martyrs, hourglasses or withered flowers. Now we can accompany a photographer down the linoleum departure gates of the dying. The task of art is to give us access to experiences it is otherwise hard to get hold of and to render their moral vivid to our distracted imaginations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The images are desperately sad but not necessarily depressing. Rather than try to crush us with the remembrance of death, they are on the side of life, they give us new determination to make sure the coming days are not wasted like so many others have been.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It no longer matters quite so much whom we squabbled with and what our anxieties may currently be about. With death in mind, we are set free from things that shouldn’t constrain us in the first place: our fears, wrong preoccupations, false values.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, we’re likely to forget the wisdom on offer here within hours. We’ll be back to losing perspective – and overlooking the sunlight and the charm of the breeze. These are the sort of ungrateful minds we all have – which is why we continuously need the resources of art to renew our connection with the unbearable but deeply necessary truths.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The images were taken by Andrew George: <a href="http://www.rightbeforeidie.com/" target="_blank">www.rightbeforeidie.com</a>.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All subjects have their specialised vocabularies; a set of words that initially sound unusual, even a touch frightening, but that can also prove oddly beautiful and beguiling.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To their enemies, key words are mere jargon, but jargon has its advantages: it allows us swiftly to get a firm hold of ideas that might otherwise have been confusing and cumbersome. They also provide touching evidence of the existence of a group of people who have come together to agree on the meaning of some dauntingly fiddly things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Psychoanalysis has been very fruitful at generating a vocabulary. The subject provides a way of being interested in and helpful about intimate suffering. It suggests that self-knowledge is the only real route to making life less disappointing, frightening and confusing. Psychoanalysis admits that the causes of our loneliness and pain are not obvious and can sound strange. It is still common to be thought ill or mad for visiting an analyst. This is sad because analysis is ultimately interested in people getting better. Through analysis, we can lessen the grip of obsessions; we can reduce unproductive anxiety, and ultimately we can become a little more ready to love and cooperate. Psychoanalysis may prove to have been one of the twentieth century’s greatest inventions.</span></p>

<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><b>De</b><b>fence Mechanism</b></p>
<p class="p1">A DEFENCE MECHANISM is a way to save ourselves from mental anguish, by interpreting our own behaviour and that of other people in a way that affirms our self-love. We deny responsibility:<i> ‘It’s not my fault’</i>. We blame others: <i>‘You have been mean</i>’. Or we tell ourselves consoling lies: <i>‘I couldn’t help it’</i>. But if the cause of such behaviour is self-protection, then it cannot be changed by argument and stern warnings. For we defend ourselves precisely when we feel in danger. Increasing the level of threat isn’t going to hasten the solution. We learn to be more reasonable, more accepting of responsibility and more accurate about our weaknesses in times of security. The goal of analysis is to make us less ‘defended’. We put our weapons down, and have the courage to let ourselves get hurt.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Pleasure Principle</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> THE PLEASURE PRINCIPLE is the idea that we are fundamentally geared to seek pleasure. However, the pursuit of immediate gratification is often at odds with other important concerns, such as the well-being of others or our own longer-term flourishing. The term asks us to reflect on all the ways in which we sacrifice psychological growth for the sake of momentary satisfaction. For example, it is more gratifying – or at least less painful – to be irritable than to be hurt, or to be lazy rather than bored. So, in order to live well we sometimes have to go to war with our instincts. Being a mature adult means waging a selective campaign against the pleasure principle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1137" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/bench.jpeg" alt="A couple lingers on a park bench" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><b>Gratitude </b></p>
<p class="p1">It’s very hard to say thank you. In the psychoanalytic vocabulary, gratitude is the capacity to admit the merits of another person, and to recognise the good they have done you. This can be scary: it is hard to accept the scale of the debt we owe others (especially, sometimes, our parents). Gratitude is a skill we have to learn and practice. If we feel we deserve everything, we do not feel gratitude. That’s what small children are like; it doesn’t (hopefully) occur to them to think that others are making an effort on their behalf. But part of becoming an adult is realising that we have been the recipient of imperfect but still substantial affection from other people. We need to start to believe in the kindness of others and to acknowledge how often they have cut us slack.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Transitional Object</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> The psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott defined the term ‘transitional object’ to describe certain items, especially teddy bears and blankets, that children use between the ages of three and nine as away of getting used to living among others. In a child’s eyes, a transitional object in some ways has a life of its own, like another person, but at the same time it is a part of oneself. The object has to be cared for, yet it exists even when one isn’t paying attention to it. It is described as ‘transitional’ because it provides one stage of a way to forming relationships with equal, independent people. Very profound things are happening around teddies (as we always suspected). Favourite books and works of art can play an analogous role in adult life, Winnicott said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5708760061_15445422e8_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8890" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5708760061_15445422e8_z.jpg?resize=635%2C390" alt="5708760061_15445422e8_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Projection</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> PROJECTION occurs when what you think is going on in another person is really coming from you. At a party you may imagine that others are wholly at ease, are not anxious at all and have no interest in you. Really, you are projecting your own worry into the minds of others. This can go a step further. You can also relocate difficult emotions on to others. An aggressive person can feel as if they are always the victim. This is because they have projected their own rage onto other people. Exploring the ways one repositions parts of oneself onto others is fascinating. The task is then to reclaim those parts – and observe others as they are, independent of you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Sublimation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> SUBLIMATION is the process whereby we convert unacceptable desires into acceptable conduct. For Freud, sex is the key thing we have to sublimate. You can’t have sex with everyone you would like, unfortunately; but the erotic impulse can – if we handle it right – become flirtation, charm, persuasiveness or a brilliant sales technique. It can even become a book or a painting that others will love. The natural desire to have everyone do exactly what you want, all of the time, can through sublimation be turned into a drive to create a perfect object. Sublimation names a process that is precious to us and gives us hope. It suggests that frustration is not the end of the story. But for that to happen, our disappointment in one direction must be met by inspiration in another.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">In general, we are very much alive to the benefits of exercise. And not only around physical fitness. In learning to speak another language, drive a car or play an instrument, we recognise the value of going over things again and again, of rehearsing, memorising and testing according to established principles. We willingly follow the advice of the tennis coach to take the ball a fraction earlier on the backhand or to overcome a tendency to maintain too upright a posture going into the shot. Ultimately what we are trying to do is to form good habits so that, with sufficient practice, we won’t have to think (for example) about how to reverse the car into a parking bay or return the ball from the left hand corner. It will simply be easy and natural.</p>
<p class="p1"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2381" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PA-19767216-1.jpg" alt="Spain Madrid Open Tennis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1">He didn’t mind exercising to get to this moment</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">However, for major cultural reasons, we are extremely selective in our enthusiasm for areas where we accept the utility of practice, teaching, systematic education, rehearsal and repetition.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Very strangely and sadly, exercise has come to feel alien in the area of our intimate emotional and cultural lives. Jane Austen – for instance – would have readily accepted that people have to learn how to have conversations, that there are rules to be practiced in relationships, and that compassion is something that can be learnt. She spoke movingly about what she termed ‘the training of the heart’. But we have subsequently developed a highly negative take on the role of teaching, rules and exercises in emotional, social and cultural life. It has come to seem as if rules will always be oppressive. The idea of learning how to have a relationship, be a friend or have a conversation now sounds unbearably stiff, too formal, pompous or just fake. So, today we train the cook, but leave the lover alone.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2383" title="" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/461278363.jpg" alt="ABC's &quot;The Taste&quot; - Season Two" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5>Here, we accept there are rules…</h5>
<p class="p1">People like to say that there are, at heart, no rules about conversation, bringing up a family or identifying a purpose to one’s life. There’s now a widespread dislike of generalisations and an assumption that no one knows the secrets of living well; we must simply make up the rules as best we can, there is no accumulated wisdom we can draw from. It’s about starting from scratch every time and cobbling together the answers through painful experiences, one mistake after another. Many influential 20th-century intellectual figures (Virginia Woolf, DH Lawrence, Sartre to start the list) were supporters of such spontaneity, naturalness and authenticity – and equal opponents of anything that looked like an ‘answer’ derived from Other People.</p>
<h5><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2384" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/82947255.jpg" alt="Napola Boys" data-recalc-dims="1" /></h5>
<h5>At one point, rules really did look like the problem</h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Their praise of spontaneity was, at a certain point, very liberating and necessary. It was a plausible reaction to rigid, unimaginative and conformist societies – who in many areas followed extremely deficient rules. But our assumptions about training and exercise have stuck around even as the external environment has changed. Gradually, in part thanks to their influence, our society now is anything but oppressive or dogmatic.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We are now more likely to suffer from a very different set of troubles. We feel chaotic – overwhelmed by our own appetites, very unsure about what we should do with our lives, fearful of wasting opportunities and afraid we won’t accomplish anything, paralysed at times by unstructured freedom.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This is therefore a highly relevant moment to reconnect with the Ancient Greek idea that living well is crucially dependent upon education: upon learning emotional skills and good habits. This particular era of history seems ready for the founding insight of Greek philosophy: that the good life is something that can be taught.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4019" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour2.jpg?resize=635%2C625" alt="662px-Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p2">
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Across large swathes of existence (relationships, travel, family life, work, ambition, anxiety, attitudes to money …) there are things we can learn how to do more reliably. There are training exercises which can significantly improve how well parts of our lives will go.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This training falls into two big kinds: <strong>Exercises of Clarification</strong> and<strong> Exercises of Reinforcement</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Exercises of Clarification</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Many of our troubling experiences, as well as many hopeful ones, are cloudy and vague – even if they are strongly felt. Who do I envy? What career really excites me? What am I annoyed or anxious about? These are questions we don’t automatically know the answer to and can often get confused about (we shout at the wrong person, take the wrong job, miss opportunities…). Our instincts in these areas are hugely consequential for our lives – and the lives of those closest to us – and yet instinct will not be enough.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">An exercise in clarification is the deliberate practice of asking yourself searching questions about instincts and of getting into the habit of trying to answer them properly.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">For instance, one may frequently feel upset or frustrated in a relationship – yet also hopeful that things can go better. It might help to have these systematic questions to hand:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What do I most resent about my partner? Have I tried to explain this properly to them (rather than complaining bitterly or remaining silent)?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">How would you like to be a better person in this relationship?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What would you like to apologise about to your partner?</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The emphasis is on clarification: bringing into focus half-formed thoughts, more closely defining suspicions, hopes and anxieties. In most cases, you know the answers already, sort of. But the answers are out of focus – and this is the fatal problem that proper mental exercise is designed to help us overcome.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">Exercises of Reinforcement</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There’s a second species of exercise. Often enough our troubles cannot really be blamed on ignorance. We know what we should do. Only we don’t do it. Classically, this is the problem known by the Ancient Greeks as ‘akrasia’ – or ‘weakness of will’. We go wrong not so much because we don’t know, but because we lack the motivation to act on our best insights. So we need constant help in bolstering and reinforcing the wiser moments.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">There are numerous tactics for providing this assistance. For a start, it helps to hear another person say what we already kind of know; it gives the belief extra weight. It enhances our trust and makes us feel a little less alone. We aren’t looking for revelation, we’re looking for corroboration.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Also, hearing truths put in elegant language or images is beneficial. Wisdom sticks better in the mind when conveyed with the sensuous force of art – in a picture, a song or a poem. For example, Buddhist thought stresses our need to build up resilience to difficult events. But it does so not only through lectures or intellectual arguments, in some of its denominations, it asks us to meditate on beautiful images of bamboo trees (some of the thinnest, strongest plants on the planet), to strengthen our sense of how we should be ready to meet with the tempests of our own lives.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2387" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/c01s01a01i01.jpg" alt="c01s01a01i01" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We also need big truths to be repeated to us. Once won’t be enough. Religions understood this. We might not agree with the messages they were trying to transmit. But they usefully pictured the mind like a bucket with holes in it. It can carry water, but only a short distance. Soon it has all leaked away. The insight that fired you up at 7.00pm – when you were driving home and the last rays of sunlight were falling across the trees of a suburban park and you felt a deep gratitude for existence and a longing to be more patient with your partner – will have vanished by 11.00pm. We need to keep going back and recovering the good ideas that are lost at every hour.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2388" title="" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/107490482.jpg" alt="Life On Kandahar Air Base" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<h5><span class="s1">Now we need one for the mind</span></h5>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We accept the need to exercise our bodies so as to get fit, but currently we are suspicious of any attempt to exercise the mind – in order to attempt to be wise.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The first thing we do in a gym is make diagnoses: we go to a different area to work on a different part of ourselves. This would be similar to what should happen in an ideal Philosophers’ Gym of the future. Instead of thinking that we need to work on our biceps, we might decide we need to work on our envy or on our confidence, our frustration or our capacities for gratitude.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Around current gyms, we understand the role of routine: we need to do the same thing many times to get results. We have developed some rather odd-looking but specially evolved exercise machines: various barbells, a contraption so you can flex your lower back muscles, routines with the exercise ball and so on… In the realm of the psyche there may be similar sets of odd-looking exercises, which we haven’t yet quite invented. There may be works of art you have to look at in certain ways, questions you have to ask yourself, texts to memorise, or situations to rehearse (being patient at the moment when you are irked; noting when you get defensive…).</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2389" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/486269289.jpg" alt="Inside the Gatorade Sports Science Institute at IMG Academy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In an ideal Philosophers’ Gym, we might walk into a room of people being tested in mock frustrating conversations, or rehearsing moments to step down during domestic rows. In a side room, we might find people analysing recent instances of particularly stubborn anxieties or breaking down hopeful fantasies into realistic plans.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">It seems a folly to abandon our inner lives to individual initiative alone. All education is based on the idea of saving people time by transmitting the best that people who came before them have said and thought. We readily accept the need to train in physics, molecular biology, cooking and advanced aeronautics: we don’t insist on stumbling our way to plausible answers on how to land a plane or operate on the frontal cortex. We should therefore cease the folly of not offering people systematic help with the no less important challenges of Relationships, Careers, Children, Friends, Meaning, Loving and Dying.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><strong><span class="s1">The Philosophers’ Gym</span></strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We suggest three initial exercises to start:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><a href="http://thephilosophersmail.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Ten-Virtues.pdf"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3675" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PM-040414-goodC.jpg?resize=635%2C312" alt="PM-040414-goodC" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://thephilosophersmail.com/PhilosophicalMeditation.pdf"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3676" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/PhilosophicalMeditation1.png?resize=635%2C312" alt="PhilosophicalMeditation1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><a href="http://thephilosophersmail.com/EnvyPhilosophical.pdf"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3677" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/envy.png?resize=635%2C312" alt="envy" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">There is no more ridiculed genre than the self-help book. Admit that you regularly turn to such titles to help you cope with existence and you are liable to attract the scorn and suspicion of all who aspire to look well-educated and serious. As if on a mission to deny the category even a shred of respectability, the publishers of self-help books deck them out with lurid covers while booksellers entomb them near the ‘Mind, Body, Spirit’ section, where they blur into an indistinguishable mass of sickly pink and purple spines.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t always like this. For two thousand years in the history of the west, the self-help book stood as a pinnacle of literary achievement. The Ancients were particularly adept practitioners. Epicurus wrote some three hundred self-help books on almost every topic, including <em>On Love, On Justice</em> and <em>On Human Life</em>. The Stoic philosopher Seneca wrote volumes advising his fellow Romans how to cope with anger (the still very readable <em>On Anger</em>), how to deal with the death of a child (Consolation to Marcia) and how to overcome political and financial disgrace (<em>Letter to Lucilius</em>). It is no injustice to describe Marcus Aurelius’s <em>Meditations</em> as one of the finest works of self-help ever written, as relevant to someone facing a financial meltdown as the disintegration of an empire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staug.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4099" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/staug.jpg?resize=635%2C457" alt="Portrait of St Augustine of Hippo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Christianity continued in this vein. The Benedictines and Jesuits poured out handbooks to help one navigate the perils of earthly life. In his medieval bestseller, <em>The Imitation of Christ</em>, the theologian Thomas à Kempis recommended that one note down sentences from the text, learn them by heart and repeat them at moments of crisis. Great self-help writers were still dispensing advice down to the early nineteenth century. Consider that master of pithy and useful phrases, Arthur Schopenhauer, author of <em>On the Wisdom of Life</em>, who explained in 1823, ‘A man must swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more disgusting in the day ahead’. The assumption behind this long tradition was that the words of others can benefit us not only by giving us practical advice, but also – and more subtly – by recasting our private confusions and griefs into eloquent communal sentences. We feel at once less alone and less afraid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adviceinlove.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4101" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/adviceinlove.jpg?resize=635%2C498" alt="VARIOUS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So what explains the gradual decline in the prestige of self-help books that continues to this day? A key catalyst was the development of the modern university system that in the mid-19th century became the main employer for philosophers and intellectuals and started to reward them not for being useful or consoling, but for getting facts right. There began an obsession with accuracy and a corresponding neglect of utility. The idea of turning to a philosopher or historian in order to become wise (an entirely natural assumption for our ancestors) started to seem laughably idealistic and adolescent. Alongside this came a growing secularisation of society, which emphasised that the modern human being could do the business of living and dying by relying on sheer common sense, a good accountant, a sympathetic doctor and hearty doses of faith in science. The citizens of the future weren’t supposed to need lectures on how to stay calm or free of anxiety. Go to a university today in the hope of finding answers to life’s great dilemmas and the academics will laugh – or call for an ambulance.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2251" title="" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp2.jpg" alt="ANTHONY ROBBINS LIFE SELF IMPROVEMENT SEMINAR IN SAN FRANCISCO, AMERICA - 1993" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And so the self-help field was abandoned to the many curious and often unfortunate types who thrive in it today: people who are reclothing the Christian message so as to promise us financial heaven if we believe in ourselves, have faith, work hard and don’t despair. Or else those with a passing acquaintance with Buddhism, psychoanalysis or Daoism. What unites modern practitioners is their fierce optimism. They make the grave assumption that the best way to cheer someone up is to tell them that all will be well. They are utterly cut off from the spirit of their more noble predecessors, who knew that the fastest way to make someone feel well is to tell her that things are as bad as, and possibly much worse than, she could ever have thought. Or, as Seneca put it so well, ‘What need is there to weep over parts of life? The whole of it calls for tears.’ </span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4103" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/selfhelp3.jpg?resize=635%2C461" alt="Various" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need self-help books like never before, so it seems especially sad that our most serious writers are unalive to the possibilities of the genre and that the very idea of saying something is ‘useful’ to a reader has become synonymous with banality. ‘Twenty tips from Othello on relationships’ might seem like a silly idea for a book, but that has more to do with the sort of contents generally filed under such a heading than anything intrinsic to the idea. Imagine what this could have been if Carlyle, Emerson or Virginia Woolf had had a shot? In our current moral and practical confusions, the self-help book is crying out to be reborn and rehabilitated.</span></p>
