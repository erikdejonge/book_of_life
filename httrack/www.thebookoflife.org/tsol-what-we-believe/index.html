                                        <h1>The School of Life: What We Believe</h1>
                </header>

                <p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.brainpickings.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/schooloflife1.jpg?resize=299%2C448" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The School of Life, which is responsible for this website, is a global organisation with a simple mission in mind. We want to increase the amount of WISDOM in circulation. We are fighting for:</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Relationships</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Work</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Leisure</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Culture</p>
<p>&#8211; Wiser Selves</p>
<p>To increase Wisdom, we undertake a number of activities; run shops and classrooms, consult to businesses, write books, make films &#8211; and aÂ diversity of other projects. Behind our activities lies a common way of looking at the world: a set of beliefs about the central challenges facing us and how our lives might be improved. Our thinking breaks down as follows:</p>
<p>1.<em><strong> Relationships</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We agree with the view (first put forward by Freud) that a fulfilled life is essentially made up of two ingredients: Love and Work. But weâ€™re also aware that disappointment, frustration and a sense of failure are very often the norm in these arenas; which both saddens us and spurs our efforts.</span></p>
<p>In our thinking about love, weâ€™re much indebted to psychoanalysis, which tells us that our childhoods mark us deeply and frequently leave us a legacy of trouble around relating to others. We can have difficulties trusting or being close, achieving the right distance or staying resilient. We are prone to â€˜transferâ€™ a lot of emotions from our past on to present day scenarios where they donâ€™t quite belong, and may thereby respond unfairly to partners without quite understanding what is driving us. We may (in the invaluable vocabulary of the English psychoanalyst John Bowlby) be either â€˜avoidantâ€™ or â€˜anxiousâ€™ in how we behave with others.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i1.wp.com/ywcacassclay.areavoices.com/files/2012/10/161_MotherBabySMALL.jpg?resize=442%2C502" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only hope of escape from these patterns is to become a little more aware of them. In our search to understand love, we are great believers in the benefits of self-knowledge and, most importantly, of that royal route to this knowledge: psychotherapy.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our current relationship difficulties also stem from a cultural source &#8211; which we call â€˜Romanticismâ€™. Weâ€™ve collectively given ourselves a deeply problematic Romantic picture of what good relationships should be like: we dream of profound intimacy, satisfying sex, an absence of secrets and only a modicum of conflict. This faith in love is touching, but it carries with it a tragic flaw: having high expectations can turn out to be an enemy of workable mature relationships.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8609" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Chatterton.jpg?resize=635%2C433" alt="Chatterton" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are instead drawn to what weâ€™ve called a Classical approach. The Classical view is cautious about love. Classical people pay special attention to what can go wrong around others. Before condemning a relationship, they consider the standard of partners across society and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances. This view of people is fundamentally, but usefully, dark. Everyone is ultimately deeply troubled and hard to live with. The only people whom one can think of as normal are those one doesnâ€™t yet know very well. </span></p>
<p>A Classical philosophy holds that because we are not naturally well equipped for the demands of relationships, we need a lot of assistance and education. We need a culture that helps us to understand ourselves and to form realistic expectations. We require regular reminders to be more patient, forgiving, understanding and appreciative.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8611" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/writingsand.jpg?resize=635%2C477" alt="Man writes 'I LOVE U' in the sand for his sweetheart, 1920-60." data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The starting point has to be a frank recognition of our natural frailties: we have to accept that we have terrible tendencies to misinterpret people and situations and regularly fail at the challenges of getting close to others. We believe that love is a skill that has to be learnt, not an impulse that can just be followed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our quest to help relationships go better, we write books, make films, run classes and offer psychotherapy.</span></i></p>
<p>2. <em><strong>SexualityÂ </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weâ€™re also aware of the scale of the hopes and challenges around sex. Though we often believe ourselves to be living in a liberated age, it remains acutely difficult not to feel shame around many of our sexual impulses. It is especially tricky to communicate what we want to those we are drawn to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, technology has made pornography a constant feature of modern love &#8211; and a challenge to our desire to integrate our sexuality with other things we might care about, like tenderness, intelligence and dignity.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8613" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-040314-pornB-1.jpg?resize=587%2C477" alt="PM-040314-pornB-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe in removing some of the shame around sex by revealing that many so-called perversionsÂ and fetishesÂ are just complex quests for intimacy. We believe in adopting a tragic view of sex, in which we can see that not all our desires can ever be fulfilled. Strategic pessimism has a role to play in managing the demands of the libido.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our work on sexuality, we write books, make films, run classes &#8211; and run a pornography site at </span></i><a href="http://www.pornastherapy.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.pornastherapy.com</span></i></a></p>
<p>3.<strong><em> Work</em></strong></p>
<p>One of the distinctive ideas of modern times is that we donâ€™t expect work to be simply a drudgery that we have to undertake to survive. We have high expectations of this huge part of our lives. Ideally, we want work to be â€˜meaningfulâ€™, which involves the belief that we are in some way either reducing the pain, or increasing the happiness of other humans.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There seem to be three things that imbue work with meaning. Firstly, a meaningful job taps into the deepest, most sincere and talented parts of us. So different people will necessarily find different sorts of work meaningful, according to what is inside their deepest self: for some meaning might emerge from baking bread, others will feel their deep self engaged by computer science, for others still, they will feel mostly full themselves, most fully alive, when investing money or teaching kids a foreign language.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8617" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/16371178501_34359cb448_z.jpg?resize=635%2C476" alt="16371178501_34359cb448_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, a meaningful job is one which to some extent helps others: which fixes a problem that humans have: a job which in ways large and small, serves humanity. Meaningful work provides a service to others. And thirdly, a job feels meaningful when the person doing it can viscerally sense, day to day, the impact of their work upon an audience. In other words, not only is the job theoretically meaningful, it actually feels meaningful as one does it in the course of an average day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why should it be so hard to find meaningful work? Why are we in such danger of doing work that brings in money but doesnâ€™t fulfill the meaning side of us? Three big reasons stand out: firstly, because it&#8217;s perilously hard for us to locate our true interests in the time we have before simply paying the bills becomes an imperative. Our interests donâ€™t manifest themselves spontaneously, they require us to patiently analyse ourselves and try out a range of options, to see what feels as if it might have the best â€˜fitâ€™ for us. But unfortunately, schools and universities, as well as society at large, doesnâ€™t place much emphasis on this stage of education; on helping people to understand their authentic working identities. Thereâ€™s far more stress on simply getting ready for any job, than a job that would be particularly well suited to us. Which is a pity not just for individuals, but for the economy as a whole because people always work better, harder and more fruitfully when their deep selves are engaged.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8621" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/PM-210214-unemploymentF.jpg?resize=635%2C383" alt="FOX 2013 Summer TCA Tour - Los Angeles" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, many jobs are relatively meaningless because itâ€™s very possible, in the current economy, to generate profits from selling people things that arenâ€™t really helping them in any way, but hoodwink them or prey on their lack of self-command. Most of us have a dangerously loose hold on what really brings us satisfaction long-term: which gives room for entrepreneurs to build huge and profitable businesses selling stuff which no one is particular proud of at the end of an average day. Those who work in these businesses know in their hearts that they havenâ€™t really helped anyone have a better life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thirdly, a job may have real meaning, may genuinely be helping others, but it may not feel like this day to day because many organisations are so large, so slow moving, so split up over so many continents that the purpose of everyoneâ€™s work day to day gets lost amidst meetings, memos, conference calls and administration.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8623" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/5380585665_72842b37ca_z.jpg?resize=635%2C410" alt="5380585665_72842b37ca_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This diagnosis helps to point the way to what we might begin to do to make work more meaningful for people: firstly, pay a lot more attention to helping people find their vocation, their real working authentic self; through moves like career psychotherapy, extended work placements and changes to school and university curricula so as to allow students to start to analyse their identities and aptitudes from a much younger age. Secondly, the more we, as customers, can support businesses engaged in meaningful work, the more meaningful jobs there will be. Consumers have an enormous power over what kind of lives we can have as producers. By raising the quality of our demand, we raise the number of jobs there are which can answer to mankindâ€™s deeper needs. Thirdly, in businesses which do carry out meaningful work, but on too large a scale over too long a period for it to feel meaningful day to day, we need to get better at telling stories of what the business is up to. We need to give work some of the intimacy of a small business, even if itâ€™s a giant multinational; lending to those who work there a tangible sense of their contribution to the whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensuring that work is meaningful is no luxury: it determines the greatest issue of all in modern economics and politics: how hard and well people will work &#8211; and therefore how successful and wealthy our societies can be.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We run a Business unit that works with companies to create more meaningful products and services; we also run a learning and development department which resolves many interpersonal issues in workplaces and we offer psychotherapy and life coaching which helps people discover their vocation and unpick conflicts around careers.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.<strong><strong><em> EducationÂ </em><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>Our ability to learn is one of the most basic things about the human condition. The range of things that we can learn to do better, via instruction, is very wide. However, the powerful influence of Romantic thinkers, who were convinced that important psychological things could not be taught, means the current education system leaves us stranded with all sorts of issues which are not passed down across generations, because they are believed to lie in the realm of intuition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take the more Classical view that all important human achievements can be taught: how to design a city; how to have a conversation, how to be a loving parent, how to be calmer or more creative&#8230; Â We currently receive no instruction around self-knowledge (how to keep calm, for example, or learn to forgive). Such things are not seen as being at the core of education and even as things than canâ€™t be learned. We passionately disagree.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8626" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/561977001.jpg?resize=635%2C450" alt="Businessmen At Conference Table" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re aware of how easily people are turned off by anything that appears too preachy and by the fatal tendency for what is worthy to come across as dull. Our commitment to education makes us very interested in seduction and charm: that is, in the arts of getting and holding people&#8217;s attention in a highly individualistic world filled with distractions and demands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because education is so central, we are ambitious about all the things that can educate us. Education isnâ€™t just what goes on in schools: the arts and the media have hugely educative roles &#8211; but our culture has tended to shy away from acknowledging them.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="https://pierjacobsen.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/daily-mail.png" alt="" width="404" height="294" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should not only be children who go to school. Adults in general should see themselves as in need of education. One should never be done with school. One should stay an active alumni, learning throughout life. In the adult section of schools, there should be courses on how to converse with strangers or how to deal with the fear of getting old; how to calm down and how to forgive. There should be career advice for the middle-aged. Schools should be where a community gets educated, not just a place for children. So children should feel that they are participating in the early stages of a life-long process. Some classes should have seven-year-olds learning alongside fifty-year-olds (the two cohorts having been found to have equivalent maturities in a given area). In the Utopia the phrase â€˜Iâ€™ve finished schoolâ€™ would sound extremely strange.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life runs physical branches around the world where you can drop in for classes on almost any topic in the arena of emotional well-being. We also diffuse our lessons through films and books. We are interested in redesigning curricula; the programme of what to know to be â€˜educatedâ€™.</span></i></p>
<p>5. <strong><em>Religion</em></strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™ve got a particular take on religion. We are clearly in a post-religious age but that doesnâ€™t make us indifferent or hostile to religious thinkers. In fact the opposite is true: we are very keen on learning from religious thinkers. The technical errors of religions (for example, the claim that the soul can be reincarnated, that Christ rose from the dead or that the creator of the cosmos made specific promises about land rights at the eastern end of the Mediterranean) historically got entwined with some highly important, enduring large scale social and psychological ambitions. Religions have been machines for addressing psychological needs, which we still have.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8630" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/216342260_d4b816f8c1_o.jpg?resize=635%2C620" alt="216342260_d4b816f8c1_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Religions at their best tried to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keep ideas about forgiveness at the front of our minds</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">encouraged compassion for the weak </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">insisted that worldly success was a fatally misleading way of assessing the worth of people</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">got us to recognise our own capacities to hurt others and to feel sorry for doing so</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nudged us to be tender and understanding towards the secret sufferings of others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">gave us helpful rituals to keep important ideas before us throughout the year</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We see the School of Life as picking up many of the tasks of religion and creating secular replacements for particular religious ideals and practices (monasteries, weddings, funerals etc.). In agreement with the great thinkers of the 19th century, we believe that culture should replace scripture.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>6. <em>Culture</em></strong></strong></p>
<p>At the moment, culture (literature, art, film, photography, theatre) isnâ€™t properly focused on taking up the crucial topics that religion formerly led the way on. People who want to express admiration for culture often say itâ€™s valuable â€˜for its own sakeâ€™. We canâ€™t agree: it is valuable because it is capable of addressing our needs for education, guidance, consolation, perspective, encouragement and correction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are drawn to the idea that culture is therapeutic. The idea of a â€˜therapeuticâ€™ culture isnâ€™t that it should help us primarily with very urgent and severe mental health issues. Itâ€™s the idea that it can assist us to get better at managing the normal troubles of everyday life; like the tendency to get unhelpfully irritated with people we like, to lose perspective over minor matters, to lose sympathy with people who deserve our compassion and to take too harsh a view of our own mistakes.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8634" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/painting.jpg?resize=635%2C443" alt="NETHERLANDS-ART-RIJKS-MUSEUM-VERMEER-RFEATURE" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing the various branches of culture having a therapeutic function isnâ€™t new &#8211; itâ€™s an idea started by Aristotle and endorsed by, among many others, Hegel and Nietzsche. We can here highlight some of the key therapeutic powers of conspicuous areas of cultural life:</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps us around inescapable failures and follies. The normal instinct is to be very annoyed with ourselves and others when we mess up. Unfortunately, this instinct often doesnâ€™t serve us very well. Comedy, at its best, makes the therapeutic move of showing the fool as loveable. We donâ€™t laugh at the fool out of derision, but out of unexpected sympathy. Â </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8636" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/jan-6-david-brent-dance.jpg?resize=635%2C351" alt="jan-6-david-brent-dance" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">History</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â teaches us to deal more effectively with the problems that face us today. It introduces us to ideas that were in circulation in the past but which are needed now. History is a corrective to the myopia of the news industry.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painting and the visual arts</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> help us by being (in Hegelâ€™s terminology) â€˜the sensuous embodiment of ideasâ€™. Often even very good ideas need to be experienced in a sensory way before they become meaningful to us. This power is revealed when a skilled piece of photography on the news makes us suddenly feel personally very touched by a geographically distant event which had previously left us cold. The role of the visual arts is to build up the images that we ought to have playing often in our minds at the difficult moments of our lives.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8638" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/138490462.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="Cardinal Marc Ouellet presides over the" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â the role of music is to support beneficial emotions and states of mind. Many states that are very important to us (calm, patience, modesty without being crushed, hopefulness, forgiveness) also tend to be fleeting and elusive. We need them, but on our own, we struggle to hold onto them. Music is a therapeutic cultural mechanism for deliberately and strategically making certain states of mind more reliably available.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Literature</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â has an astonishing ability to take us inside the experience of other people. So we can, even if only briefly, experience the world through the eyes of those who once seemed foreign and threatening, a move we find so hard in our daily lives. Novels lend us more lives than we have properly been granted.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8641" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/rexfeatures_551159ae.jpg?resize=635%2C381" alt="PRIDE AND PREJUDICE - 1995" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ArchitectureÂ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creates environments that have characteristics comparable to human ones. We need buildings and cities that encourage our own better natures &#8211; by presenting in a lasting and very large-scale way the characteristics we ourselves have at our best. Ideally, buildings give long-term and public encouragement to the social virtues of harmony, modesty and dignity. Â </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fashion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a form of communication: it promotes identity. What we wear tells other people (and ourselves) something about who we are. Fashion tends to strike serious people as vain and silly because the messages that clothes happen to send are often not very helpful or admirable. But they sometimes are and could be much more.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.fashiongonerogue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/MargetHowellSS1.jpg?resize=483%2C633" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>We believe that the world has, up to now, not properly made use of the huge therapeutic potential of culture. We pay reverence to culture: but we have not yet learnt how to use it systematically.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life has curated a number of museum shows which put our theories on public display. We run websites at </span></i><a href="http://www.artastherapy.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.artastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><a href="http://www.booksastherapy.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.booksastherapy.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span></i><a href="http://www.foodastherapy.org/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.foodastherapy.org</span></i></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have built a secular monastery in mid-Wales with the architect John Pawson.</span></i></p>
<p><strong><strong>7. <em>PoliticsÂ </em></strong></strong></p>
<p>We believe that paternalism has an important role to play in good societies. We know how scary that can sound and how strong libertarian voices can be. Libertarianism is an exaggerated stance with roots in all our psyches and says that no one else can know what is right for another person, most of all a government. Freedom and choice are everything. No one should be telling us &#8216;what to do&#8217;.</p>
<p>However, we believe that a good paternalistic government wonâ€™t ever be imposing an alien agenda. A sound democratic government is able to remind voters that a certain piece of legislation is what they themselves would ask for in their calmer, more reasonable, more tender moments. Itâ€™s not that the government is claiming to know best; it&#8217;s that we as individuals know best, but because weâ€™re leaky vessels, we forget &#8211; and therefore willingly entrust the government with the task of drawing us back to our own, temporarily neglected, insights.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8646" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/14451317753_8923ae663e_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="14451317753_8923ae663e_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At best, nationalism makes a valuable contribution to peopleâ€™s lives. We should be able to feel proud of our countries &#8211; out of admiration for their virtues. Itâ€™s good for us, as individuals, to participate in projects that are bigger than ourselves: things weâ€™d love to do but canâ€™t manage on our own. At the moment we recognise this around sport. We argue for the extension of collective pride to other, more consequential, parts of life. Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Itâ€™s wise to operate with a broad conception of politics. Politics should include a concern for psychotherapy and for what is broadcast on television. Aesthetics is a political matter: it matters how the world looks. The physical environment we create feeds back states of mind to us. Economics must be geared to the happiness of the greatest number. The task of politics is to create the platform for individual and collective flourishing.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life sees itself as a political organisation.</span></i></p>
<p>8. <strong><em>The Media</em><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>The media is hugely important to our chances of fulfilment &#8211; because it gives a society a picture of itself, shapes the agenda of politics and claims to know what information is most vital to us.</p>
<p>However, very often, the media presents a challenge to our attempt to lead good lives; it prevents us from seeing the real issues and holding on to them, it is obsessed either by unhelpful ideologies or by a commitment to a bland neutrality of ideology; it is a breeding ground for feelings of undigested envy and material dissatisfaction; it fails to explain the economy to us; it informs us about disasters in other lands without granting us the tools for empathy; it constantly frightens and alarms us, heightening our sense of fragility; it leads us to distrust strangers and to have a very bleak view of collective life.</p>
<p>Part of learning how to stay sane is to have a robust approach for how to deal with the stream of incoming information from the media.</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life ran a news organisation at </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.philosophersmail.com/">www.philosophersmail.com</a>, set up <a title="News as therapy" href="http://newsastherapy.com/" target="_blank">www.newsastherapy.com</a></span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Â and now runs a popular Youtube channel (<a href="http://youtube.com/theschooloflifetv" target="_blank">www.youtube.com/theschooloflifetv</a>). It is deeply interested in mass communication.</span></i></p>
<p>9. <strong><em>ConsumerismÂ </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thereâ€™s a fairly widespread anxiety around consumption. Thoughtful people often complain that â€˜weâ€™ve become too consumeristâ€™ or they say theyâ€™re sick of â€˜materialismâ€™.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think that itâ€™s not consumption or materialism &#8211; buying things and getting excited by possessions &#8211; thatâ€™s really the problem here.Â </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trouble is that weâ€™ve not collectively made a clear distinction between </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">good </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> versions of these things. We agree thereâ€™s plenty of bad consumption around. But the way to deal with it is to beef up our capacity for good consumption. The same goes for materialism. It turns out there are very good kinds of materialistic behaviours.</span></p>
<p>Material objects can play positive psychological (or spiritual) roles in our lives. Our highest ideals can get â€˜materialisedâ€™ in physical objects, so that by buying and using these things weâ€™ll be getting closer to our better selves.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://i2.wp.com/cdn.nest.co.uk/product-media/N0C/1200/900/Wastberg-Chipperfield-w102-Table-Lamp.jpg?resize=579%2C434" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be surprising to recall that religions have often been very in favour of certain kinds of materialism. At the core of Catholicism, for instance, was the idea that the faithful could get closer to Jesus by joining in a re-enactment of the Last Supper. The bread and wine &#8211; which believers consumed during the mass &#8211; were the outward, physical signs of the spiritual nourishment that was on offer. The big insight was that the â€˜outwardâ€™ material parts were crucial. In theology this move was called â€˜transubstantiation.â€™ It deserves a special word, because itâ€™s a crucial idea: a physical object can take on a new spiritual identity, it can be the outward shape that a higher value needs to adopt in order to best be encountered in our lives. So, ideally, every good material possession â€˜transubstantiatesâ€™ our psychological needs in a physical form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Religions have often cared hugely what their temples look like, what clothes people wear in sacred places, how you should move, how loud you can speak, what the lighting should be like, how the furniture should be designed. In other words they had a host of strongly material concerns. But they had them because they were determined to get material things to serve a higher and noble purpose: the development of oneâ€™s soul.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8654" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_Rafael.jpg?resize=635%2C458" alt="800px-Disputa_del_Sacramento_(Rafael)" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same move applies outside of religions. Material objects are good when they support our own better nature and consumerism is good when it is geared to providing ourselves with these kinds of possessions. Thereâ€™s a crucial constructive psychological role for possessions. And good consumerism occurs when people get really focused on finding the objects that can play this role for them. Hunting for the ideal alarm clock, or the perfect pair of socks, neednâ€™t be the enemy of the wise and mature life.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life operates a retail unit at </span></i><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/shop"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">www.theschooloflife.com/shop</span></i></a></p>
<p>10. <em><strong>CapitalismÂ </strong></em></p>
<p>Economies look as if they are basically about huge material facts &#8211; oil fields, communications satellites, huge retail complexes, vast entertainment districts. But behind these impressive factors, we believe, that the economy is to an extraordinary extent a psychological phenomenon driven by our collective appetites and our imaginations and longings. It is what people are willing to pay for that generates profit and organises the whole system of investment.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The education of the customer is, therefore, one of the key economic moves for today. It was a big theme in the past. Some of the great thinkers focused their ambitions in this area. John Ruskin and William Morris hoped to transform the economy (and hence change how profits were made and who would get rich) by influencing what people wanted. They had ideas about what consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">should</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want, whereas today the most energetic efforts are made to track (and meet) whatever consumers </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">happen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to want.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8656" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/aod-jaguar-1.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="aod-jaguar-1" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our big shot at influencing preferences and taste is via advertising. But thatâ€™s not usually got the real needs of the consumer at heart. What advertising does though is show how much can be done to shape taste and preference. Weâ€™d like to see equally creative and seductive advertising that was trying to promote the things we genuinely need (a couple might need to forgive each other more than they need a holiday; a child might need to feel less paralysed by homework, more than they need more take away pizza).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weâ€™re very impressed by the productivity of capitalism &#8211; and we want to harness it to even more ambitious goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, capitalism has unsurprisingly tended to focus on the supply of our more basic needs. Weâ€™re interested in a kind of capitalism that operates further up Abraham Maslowâ€™s famous Pyramid of Needs: thatâ€™s as efficient at meeting our needs for understanding as for sweet things to eat; thatâ€™s as great at helping us find OK partners as it is, at present, great at uniting us with the ideal sandwich.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8658" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_.png?resize=466%2C349" alt="640px-Maslows_Hierarchy_of_Needs.svg_" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we donâ€™t think the question should be: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capitalism &#8211; yes or no? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The core issue is about improving capitalism to make sure it is fulfilling our highest needs.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The School of Life tries to tug businesses to make a better sort of capitalism via its business unit: </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.theschooloflife.com/business">www.theschooloflife.com/business</a></span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the School of Life, we are keen to demonstrate that the proper role of ideas is to lead to the transformation of our societies in positive directions. We hope that our ideas will be, above all, ideas to live by.</p>
