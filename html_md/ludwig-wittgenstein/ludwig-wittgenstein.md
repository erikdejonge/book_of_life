A lot of unhappiness comes about in this world because we canâ€™t let other people know what we mean clearly enough. One of the philosophers who can help us with this is Ludwig Wittgenstein. He was a philosopher, obsessed with the difficulties of language, who wanted to help us find a way out of some of the muddles we get into with words.
