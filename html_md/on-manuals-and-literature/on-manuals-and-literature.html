                </header>

                <p>Businesses often provide us with manuals, so we can better use their services and products:</p>
<ul>
<li>a technical dossier comes with your new car or washing machine</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a folder in the hotel room, with instructions about what to do if you want to adjust the temperature or have some shirts pressed at short notice</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a flat-pack set of shelves and cupboards is accompanied by an instruction booklet showing you how to put all the bits together</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there are signs telling you how to reach your departure gate</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>there’s a safety card in the pouch in front of you on the plane telling you how to inflate the life jacket</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>a leaflet arrives with a new credit card</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally, manuals are quietly charming, with encouraging pictures, numbered diagrams and little arrows. And one feels a burst of affectionate gratitude, when one has been carefully shepherded through a tricky task to a happy outcome: the self-assembly bed is finally up; one’s playlist is at last blasting out on the car stereo; one has found a way to record the talent show. Generally, though, manuals veer towards the tedious and the pedantic and we regularly dismiss them to the back of a drawer without a glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these manuals are touching on a crucial ambition. They aim to bring us to an ideal relationship with the things we have purchased. Their approach to this task, however, is limited to addressing purely technical, physical challenges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are interested in the areas that current manuals tend to neglect. Beyond understanding how a product works, the real goal is to help a consumer have a good </span><b>psychological </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">relationship with the thing they’ve bought.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9387" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/15180175779_7e898c9c25_z.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="15180175779_7e898c9c25_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with good psychological relationships to people, this involves two fundamental issues:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to love it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: ideally the customer feels real affection for</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the thing they have bought. They are warmly appreciative of the hotel, the car, the washing machine or the assistance they get from their financial advisors. We know this sometimes happens &#8211; but it is elusive and rare</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">how to deal with the challenging aspects </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of a product or service. Being around another person inescapably involves disappointments and frustrations. But in a good psychological relationship one copes with them; they don’t derail affection. No product or service can live up to every fantasy one might have about it. A car will start to age; not every employee in a hotel can have a winning personality; inevitably some investment strategies will be less successful; a restaurant will sometimes get very busy and service will get stretched. In reality, no business can ensure that things will always go as planned, and the question of how to maintain love through tricky patches becomes important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understanding how to develop good psychological relationships to products and services we should be looking at </span><b>Culture</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, broadly defined as the arts. It can sound like an improbable place to turn for help. But Culture is a repository of thousands of years of attempts to have good relationships with bits of the world. We’re understandably a bit blind to this, because Culture has generally been extremely suspicious about offering its insights to the world of business. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9354" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012.jpg?resize=635%2C493" alt="800px-Caspar_David_Friedrich_012" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Caspar David Friedrich, <em>The Watzmann</em> (1824-25): he is trying to get us to love mountains, not get us to buy one</h5>
<p>Culture is a resource waiting to be tapped, because it deals with the same basic issue as companies: how do you develop a good psychological relationship to something. The lessons embedded in Culture can be extracted and redirected to places where we need them today: in our relations to products and services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying something and loving it are slightly different: buying it is the beginning. Learning to love something involves two big factors: properly appreciating the pleasures it offers and dealing with the sorrows that can be connected to it.</span></p>
<p><b>Pleasures</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a slightly strange thought that we might need to learn to enjoy something. But quite often pleasures are experienced in a fleeting, low-key way and we don’t fully recognise them &#8211; just as at a reception where you need to raise an issue with an important new contact, you might barely notice the taste of the unusually delicious canapés, until someone mentions how nice they are and turns the spotlight of your attention on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what culture does so brilliantly across a wide range of experiences. We can think of culture as a toolkit for registering pleasures that we were maybe too distracted or intimidated to notice &#8211; because they didn’t seem to fit the accepted notion of where pleasure could be found. Culture has built up techniques for getting us to attend to novel pleasures, and hence to come to love things that, up to then, we didn’t realise we could.</span></p>
<p><b><b>a. How culture helps when we are too distracted to notice</b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9355" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku_Pine_Trees.jpg?resize=635%2C296" alt="1024px-Hasegawa_Tohaku,_Pine_Trees" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Hasegawa</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 16th century, the Japanese artist Hasegawa developed a new subject matter for screen paintings: ghostly pine trees glimpsed through the mist. Prior to Hasegawa, it was hard to notice how nice such a sight is. As they walked through a garden, people must occasionally have had a fleeting sense that this could be rather lovely. But in the paintings, Hasegawa focuses our attention &#8211; he isolates the experience. He singles it out from of the mass of other distracting things and says: this is worth special notice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the encouragement offered by the artist, it would feel a bit weird to get excited about this kind of scene: you’d fear other people would have no idea what you were on about. You don’t want to be the one person who says &#8211; this is brilliant, when everyone else thinks it rubbish (we like having some hints around that others will respond positively). The Japanese artist gives pine trees in the mist glamour and prestige. You start to look out for this kind of pleasure yourself. You might find yourself daydreaming about an autumnal trip to Kyoto.</span></p>

<h5 style="text-align: center;">Gilbert White</h5>
<p>For most of human history, people didn’t have much time for hedgehogs. Lots of people must have had a vague sense that there is something charming about them, but this low-wattage feeling would have been swamped by the entrenched habit of regarding them merely as pests with dangerously sharp bristles and an annoying tendency to chew up lettuces and petunias in the garden. The more positive attitude didn’t come into focus until an eccentric 18th-century English vicar in the village of Selborne became deeply fascinated by hedgehogs and wrote movingly about them in his pioneering book, <em>The Natural History of Selborne</em>. And thanks to his perceptive enthusiasm, the hedgehog emerged from ignominy to be seen as one of the most endearing of all small creatures.<strong><strong><br />

<p><b>b. How culture helps when we are too intimidated to notice</b></p>
<p><b>Joseph Beuys</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The German artist Joseph Beuys got very interested in materials that we generally don’t find in any way special. He was particularly attached to felt, which was mainly used as a packing filler before the invention of styrofoam. It was seen as a deeply weird interest at first. Artists working in three-dimensions were supposed to be dealing with high-status materials like bronze and marble. But, gradually, Beuys’s enthusiasm became persuasive. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9358" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/infiltration-for-piano.jpg?resize=635%2C415" alt="infiltration-for-piano" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By wrapping revered objects &#8211; like violins and grand pianos &#8211; in felt, he revealed the kindly, protective character of this inexpensive cloth. A piano, which hardly anyone can play well, could emerge as friendly and funny as a baby elephant.</span></p>
<p><b>Bernd and Hilla Becher</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Old cooling towers are mostly thought of as eyesores. And generally they would be thought unworthy of love. It would seem bizarre to get excited by them. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9359" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/x1990-68A-I-782x1024.jpg?resize=550%2C663" alt="113.tif" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5>Bernd and Hilla Becher, <em>The Cooling Towers </em>(1959-77)</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By drawing our attention to their design &#8211; and getting us to look at them more generously &#8211; the artists Bernd and Hilla Becher reassure us that it’s actually not so strange to feel affection for them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These moves that generate love &#8211; by direction, attention and making it feel safe to like something &#8211; have been around for a long time in art. But they can also be very helpful in our encounters with things we buy. We can imagine how they might play out </span>in the world of manuals:</p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9360" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hqdefault.jpg?resize=480%2C360" alt="hqdefault" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Miele washing machines</h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the manual is explicit about the technical abilities of a Miele washing machine. It guides us to admire the way the automatic dispensing system releases the liquid detergent in two phases and it draws out attention to the advantages of the Quick Power Wash cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the idea that we might come to really like &#8211; and even love &#8211; the machine depends on noticing and appreciating a wider range of its features. The revised ideal version of the manual would also point out that the experience of closing the door is remarkably satisfying. The rubber round the opening rim is of unusually high quality and when the door is closed the glass fits against it with perfect precision. And it’s very nice to sit on the floor and peer through the glass as clothes tumble around. The heavy drum and quiet motors make a rather lovely low, rhythmic sound. You might want to linger for a while because it’s so soothing. It is &#8211; in its way &#8211; an invitation to a kind of meditation.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9361" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bmw-330d-touring-7.jpg?resize=635%2C421" alt="bmw-330d-touring-7" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The indicator makes an especially pleasing clicking sound. Also the handbrake is a delight to use: it feels smooth and light and yet not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">too</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> light: you sense its power.</span></p>
<p><b>A holiday resort:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9411" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/5686057305_836543e92a_z.jpg?resize=635%2C357" alt="5686057305_836543e92a_z" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hotel information package will let you know you can collect a towel from the bar and that it’s advisable to book a lounger before 10.30am when things tend to get busy. It’s all set up so you can spend some time sunbathing. But at the moment a manual would leave things there. We already all know everything about why we like sunbathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But there’s a lot about why sunbathing is nice which maybe we haven’t thought of yet &#8211; and the hotel manuals of the future would be on hand to guide us to them.  </span></p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9409" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/540874976_bbb49eda8c_o.jpg?resize=635%2C619" alt="540874976_bbb49eda8c_o" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Basking in the sun, we become a slightly different &#8211; possibly nicer, more sensuous, more kindly &#8211; versions of ourselves. However luxurious the surroundings, the main ingredient we’re enjoying at this moment is purely natural. Nature is beneficent, we don’t have to strive. It’s an important corrective to the habits of mind we’ve generally adopted to cope with life in northern cities where mostly it’s overcast and damp and we feel we cannot be loved except in relation to what we achieve.</span></p>
<p><b>Sorrows</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A good relationship can’t just be about enjoying the good thing. It also involves being helpful when things go wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two fundamental ways in which things go wrong psychologically around products and services: they don’t live up to our hopes and, however perfect it is in itself, a new purchase turns out not eliminate all the other problems in our lives. Let’s look more closely at each issue in turn.</span></p>
<p><b>When the things we buy don’t live up to our hopes</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advertising increases our hopes and hints that the object will improve the whole of our lives. They set the bar so high that in reality no goods or services could quite live up to them. The hotel, car or dishwasher you buy might be pretty nice, but you’ll constantly be reminded (often by advertising) that there are much nicer things around. No matter what you have, someone somewhere has something better. The trouble isn’t really with the thing we’ve bought, but with our psychological relationship to it. We’re deeply prone to envy.</span></p>
<p><b>The troubles of life continue</b></p>
<p>You might have a furious argument with your partner about who does what when it comes to laundry &#8211; and the rather nice washing machine is the witness to some lacerating encounters.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The car is great, but while driving it you will experience many times of anguish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s also important because no matter how good the thing we buy is, we can always end up being very distressed in its company. It was a point made originally by one of the first great philosophers of consumption: the Greek thinker Epicurus. </span></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9363" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/epi006.jpg?resize=635%2C550" alt="epi006" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He observed that the power of the object to make us happy is, at crucial moments, weaker than the power of the rest of what’s happening in our lives (trouble at work, a row with one’s partner, indigestion, fear of missing out) to make us miserable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical manuals are generally unfazed by the idea that the object may be less than perfect. They include trouble shooting sections and give the number of a helpline. They mention money back guarantees and replacement warranties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the whole, this doesn’t extend to the psychological area. Adverts are often sentimental: in the sense that they are devoted only to showing us the good sides and are effectively in denial about the darker, more disappointing aspects of a product or service. They operate with the natural &#8211; but mistaken &#8211; idea that if you want a relationship to go well you must always insist that everything is just great all the time. But we know a good friend doesn’t behave like this. They don’t abandon us when we&#8217;re down. The relationship is damaged. It gets stronger and deeper when disappointments and troubles are faced together. </span></p>
<p><b>Culture has often investigated how we build relationships around things going wrong or being very far from perfect.</b></p>
<p><b>Virgil and Dante </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9364" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante.jpg?resize=635%2C475" alt="Eugène_Delacroix_-_The_Barque_of_Dante" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Divine Comedy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tells the story of the Italian poet Dante&#8217;s journey through Hell &#8211; during which he encounters many deeply disturbing things &#8211; like the river where those who have been guilty of vicious anger torment one another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dante is accompanied by the Roman poet Virgil. When Dante is terrified, exhausted or confused, Virgil is on hand to support him. Virgil the ideal companion: patient, generous &#8211; and well informed: he can explain, reassure, contextualise and put things in perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The good companion isn’t preventing bad things happening &#8211; they can’t do that. Life is radically imperfect and we’re bound to encounter many troubles. Rather than pretend troubles can be always avoided, they help us cope. </span></p>
<p><b>Robert Frost</b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9365" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS.jpg?resize=635%2C640" alt="800px-Robert_Frost_NYWTS" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things culture has become very adept at is letting us know that we are not alone with our troubles. It often shows us that people who look sedate and respectable (as the poet Robert Frost generally does in photos) might really understand and share some of our more harrowing moments. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acquainted with the Night</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have been one acquainted with the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have outwalked the furthest city light.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have looked down the saddest city lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have passed by the watchman on his beat</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong> </strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When far away an interrupted cry</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Came over houses from another street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although he’s talking about his own sadness, it’s quietly comforting to hear. It doesn’t make the pain go away, but it takes away an edge of panic &#8211; the terrible feeling that one is uniquely marked out for misery.</span></p>
<p><b>William Eggelston</b></p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9366" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/troubled_waters_c.jpg?resize=635%2C423" alt="troubled_waters_c" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The photographer William Eggleston was fascinated by small town gas stations. Especially ones run by the modest Arco franchise. The forecourts are not very prepossessing, but he wasn’t turned off. Although they are not the sort of thing you are supposed to like, he realised that he did. He liked their comforting melancholy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arco themselves, however, are less aware of their own appeal. When they advertise, they try to suggest their stations are more sleek. It’s a missed opportunity. We’re often quietly moved and drawn to things that are a bit run down, very imperfect and a touch melancholy.</span></p>
<p><b>Marcel Proust </b></p>
<p><strong><strong><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9367" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.thebookoflife.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image04.jpg?resize=635%2C502" alt="image04" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At one point in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Search of Lost Time,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the narrator goes on holiday and stays at a grand hotel at the seaside, on the Normandy coast. He has a lovely room with a sea view. The management has gone to great lengths to make it elegant and cosy. But his first night there is very difficult. The unfamiliar objects keep forcing themselves on his attention; he can’t settle down to sleep. There’s a very pretty clock, but its quiet ticking drives him crazy. It’s actually no louder than the clock in his bedroom at home, but familiarity has accustomed him to that and made it ‘disappear’. He hasn’t got anything to complain of to the manager: it’s not really a complaint about his luxury room. Rather he’s describing a problem of first nights in new places and there’s nothing the staff could do to put it right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In writing about this, Proust is getting close to his readers: he’s put his finger on a common enough frustration: I book a nice hotel room, then I had a bad night. But it doesn’t mean I hate the hotel.</span></p>
<p><b>These ideas about our troubles and sorrows have been around for a very long time in Culture. How could they play out around commercial products and services?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should acknowledge that things can go psychologically wrong around the objects and services they offer.</span></p>
<p><b>Miele</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you build up hopes around our machines. We have done everything we can to make them good at washing clothes. But often tensions accumulate around doing the laundry. It seems unbearably repetitive, even pointless sometimes.</span></p>
<p><b>BMW</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s so tempting and natural to imagine that this car will have consequences beyond itself. You will be happy, with your partner, with your work. But many things will go wrong. We know that &#8211; and we are a gentle Virgil keeping you company around the horrors that can unfold in the back of cars. Someone will quietly reject you. The traffic will snarl up when you </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">cannot be late </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a crucial meeting.</span></p>
<p><b>Hotel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are problems travel cannot solve. When we go to a new place we tend to forget that there is something we cannot leave behind: ourselves. When travelling alone many people find they get lonely or melancholy in a hotel room; families squabble, couples get on each other’s nerves. We can put a flower or a bonbon on your pillow in the evening, but there are many causes of restless nights.</span></p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up to now, manuals have been doing an important task. They have been showing us how to get the most out of the things we buy and how to deal with the difficulties that might arise. But they have done this only around technical matters. What we’re saying is that the psychological relationship to goods and services is just as important. Because many of the things than can go well or badly are psychological: they are to do with our hopes, fears, what we notice and get excited by and what disappoints us. The ideal outcome is that we can love the things we buy &#8211; which means appreciating their merits and bearing with the ways they let us down. It’s the same as what happens around loving another person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loving goods and services is a big ideal of good capitalism. It can sound a touch romantic &#8211; but it’s actually the best relationship from an economic point of view: it’s the best source of profit. What we’re saying is that there’s a whole range of issues that companies can address to help their clients love what they provide.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help this happen, we need to develop a new kind of literature, which might be called commercial literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the great traditional ambitions of literature has been to tell the story of how a couple moves through hope and disappointment to lasting, secure and mature love. We actually have many relationships in our lives, and in the modern economy, many of these are to do with the things we buy. It would be a huge benefit to have in our culture a lot of engaging stories about how people come to a similarly mature love for (for example) a car, a hotel, or a washing machine.</span></p>
