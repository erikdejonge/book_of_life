On Being Very Normal
====================

It really matters what we think of as ‘being normal,’ because we are collective creatures. We’re acutely receptive to group dynamics and sensitive to where we fit in – or the ways in which we don’t. No matter how much we praise individualism and see ourselves as unique we are, in fact, deeply influenced by our picture of what is ‘normal’ in our society.

<span class="s1">This is a problem because our picture of what is normal is in fact – very often – way, way out of line with what is actually true and widespread. Many things that we might assume are uniquely odd or disconcertingly strange – and which cut us off from other people – are in fact completely average and ubiquitous: </span>

***<span class="s1">If you … </span>***

<span class="s1">- sense you’ve married the wrong person</span>

<span class="s1">- get sick with envy when a friend succeeds</span>

<span class="s1">- think about your partner’s sister in bed</span>

<span class="s1">- want to cry when anyone criticises you</span>

<span class="s1">- dislike the way you look</span>

<span class="s1">- panic at the thought of having a conversation with a stranger</span>

<span class="s1">- worry a great deal about farting in public</span>

<span class="s1">- feel you might vomit in a meeting out of fear</span>

<span class="s1">- can’t sleep well in hotels</span>

<span class="s1">- find that your voice starts to give way or crack when you have to speak to anyone important</span>

<span class="s1">- are worried about sitting on a dirty toilet seat</span>

<span class="s1">- trip over tiny cracks in the pavement</span>

<span class="s1">- have sexual thoughts about members of your own family</span>

<span class="s1">- bump your head trying to get nonchalantly into a taxi</span>

<span class="s1">- are turned on by some pretty weird people in the news, like the president of Russia</span>

<span class="s1">- masturbate a lot</span>

<span class="s1">- regard yourself as a fraud</span>

<span class="s1">- worry about not making it to the toilet in time</span>

<span class="s1">- walk into doors, lampposts, car wing mirrors and bollards</span>

<span class="s1">- often worry that other people can see your genitals</span>

<span class="s1">- are gripped by the fear you will by mistake spit on your dining companion in a restaurant</span>

<span class="s1">- fear other people think you’re a pervert</span>

<span class="s1">- still think about a relationship that ended badly eleven years ago</span>

<span class="s1">…. then you can quietly congratulate yourself: ***you are deeply normal.***</span>

<span class="s1">The picture of normality has been drawn, in our culture, by slightly brutish characters. It’s not simply that the picture has tended to stress externals over internals: suggesting to us that it’s normal to have a gleaming kitchen or go on a foreign holiday every year. It’s rather that the assumptions about what it’s like to be alive, to be a human being, have been skewed.</span>

<span class="s1">Our culture has tried to project an idea of an organised, poised and polished self, as the standard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>way most people are. And this encourages us to get impatient and disgusted with ourselves when we don’t live up to expectations. We want to shout that we need to buck up, get it together and stop being so weak or so weird. But instead of expecting ourselves to be normal in the sense of being calm, coherent and rational, and getting ashamed when we’re not, it’s far better to recognise the omnipresence and sheer normality of madness, waywardness and alarm in every single human soul.</span>
