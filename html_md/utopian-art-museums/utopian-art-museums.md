What Art Museums Should Be For
==============================

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Things seem to be going really well with the institution of the art museum. All the big cities have one</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, new ones are popping up constantly </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the lines to get into blockbuster shows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can snake around the block</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite the buzz, museums are arguably not doing as much for us as they might; their whole purpose and function in modern society has been left oddly rather unexplored. Many of us show up at these museums more out of guilt than genuine pleasure. The prestige of art – as opposed to any spontaneous enthusiasm – is what seems to keep a sizeable share of people coming through the doors. And a lot of the more recent art on display can be deeply puzzling to behold – even if we don’t generally reveal our confusion for fear of seeming foolish. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the heart of the problem of the art museum is an institutional inability to define in simple terms what art might actually be for and quite why it should matter so much. We may be heartily convinced of art’s importance, but we have a devilishly hard time pinning the significance down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a suggestion: the purpose of art is therapeutic. It is there to lend inspiration and consolation in relation to a number of the challenges of being human. Art helps us to cope with, among other things:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inability to focus on what is beautiful and precious in life</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- our tendency to caricature others and forget about their sufferings </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- our inclination to lose hold of our inherent creativity and playfulness </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- our frustrated longings to create better societies</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- and our need for stillness, perspective and solemnity in an angry chaotic world</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though it may be fashionable to say otherwise, art is definitely not there just ‘for art’s sake.’ It is a tool to help us to live and die well; it opens our eyes, it returns us to a sense of creativity, it connects us with strangers, it shakes us from political complacency, it stills our agitated hearts. Art has a healing function.</span>

 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This gives us all we need to define what an art museum should be:</span>

**An institution that displays and arranges art in ways that can best heal its audiences.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a stark and deliberately vulgar definition would have revolutionary implications.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, most art museums are laid out chronologically </span>as if the most important thing about works of art was when they were made.

 

But with a better focus on the function of art, works could now be rearranged according to the distinctive troubles of the soul they could help us with.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There could be a gallery devoted to addressing The Agonies of Love</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Another focused on helping us cope with Anxiety; a third devoted to issues of Envy</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A fourth to Aging and so on…</span>

Entire museums might bite off one part of a therapeutic emotional curriculum.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There might be a Museum for Calm</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that would collect a range of works that helped to usher in this prized mood from across all centuries and media. There could be A Museum for Creativity; A Museum for Friendship – and so on. Some might be very big. Others quite small. They might exist online or in a narrow space between a pub and a kebab shop</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You often hear it said that ‘museums of art are our new cathedrals’: in other words, that art can heal us as religions once did. It’s an intriguing and vital idea which art museums haven’t in fact taken up, because while they expose us to objects of genuine importance, they seem unable to curate them in ways that link them powerfully to our inner needs. Our new cathedrals are underperforming.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We should give up on the idea of the art museum as some kind of dead storage space for the history of the subject or a whitewashed cavern that stays intimidatingly silent as to its purpose. The art museum deserves to be reborn as a kind of superior chemist or drugstore, that vividly signposts art and culture and uses it to bring inspiration, solace and meaning to our confused, anxious and troubled societies.</span>
